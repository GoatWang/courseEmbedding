Dynamic Gold
The Dynamic Gold Family is the Gold Standard by which all other irons shafts are measured. Dynamic Gold uses Variable Wall Technology and a tour-proven step pattern to provide exceptional performance for serious golfers. This high-flex, tour-weight steel golf shaft is designed for skilled players seeking a low, penetrating ball flight for optimum control and accuracy.








 TEMPO
Your swing tempo isn't just your swing speed but also your swing pace. Consider how you pull the club back, how long it hangs in the air and how quickly you swing through the ball. Swing tempo helps indicate how the club is loaded and how the club will react through impact.


 TRAJECTORY
Golfers who want a low, penetrating ball flight should choose a shaft with a lower trajectory.


 SPIN
Selecting the correct shaft spin helps maximize carry distance and optimize landing angle.

Nature and
Continuance of Operations  




 

Dynamic
Gold Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada on 21 January 2004 and is in the
exploration stage.

These
interim consolidated financial statements and related notes are
presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The
Company is an exploration stage enterprise, as defined in
Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”
or “ASC”) 915-10, “ Development Stage
Entities ”. The Company is devoting all of its present
efforts in establishing a new business, and its planned principle
operations have not commenced, and, accordingly, no revenue has
been derived during the organization period.

The
Company is in the business of acquiring and exploring mineral
properties. The recoverability of the amounts expended by the
Company on acquiring and exploring mineral properties is dependent
upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the
ability of the Company to complete the acquisition and/or
development of the properties and upon future profitable
production.

The
Company’s interim consolidated financial statements as at 30
September 2010 and for the three month period then ended have been
prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and
commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has a
loss of $23,260 for the three month period ended 30 September 2010
(30 September 2009 – $23,393, cumulative –$451,156),
and has a working capital deficit of $198,356 at 30 September 2010
(30 June 2010 – $190,996).

Management
cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve
profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise
additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that the
Company’s capital resources should be adequate to continue
operating and maintaining its business strategy during the fiscal
year ending 30 June 2011. However, if the Company is unable to
raise additional capital in the near future, due to the
Company’s liquidity problems, management expects that the
Company will need to curtail operations, liquidate assets, seek
additional capital on less favourable terms and/or pursue other
remedial measures. These interim consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

At 30
September 2010, the Company had suffered losses from exploration
activities to date. Although management is currently attempting to
implement its business plan, and is seeking additional sources of
equity or debt financing, there is no assurance these activities
will be successful. Accordingly, the Company must rely on its
president to perform essential functions without compensation until
a business operation can be commenced. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern. The interim consolidated financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

The
Accounting Standards Codification

In June
2009, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 168, “The FASB Accounting
Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles – a replacement of FASB Statement No.
162” . The Codification reorganized existing U.S.
accounting and reporting standards issued by the FASB and other
related private sector standard setters into a single source of
authoritative accounting principles arranged by topic. The
Codification supersedes all existing U.S. accounting standards; all
other accounting literature not included in the Codification (other
than Securities and Exchange Commission guidance for
publicly-traded companies) is considered non-authoritative. The
Codification was effective on a prospective basis for any annual
reporting periods ending after 15 September 2009. The adoption of
the Codification changed the Company’s references to GAAP
accounting standards, but did not impact the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Basis of
presentation

The
interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applicable to exploration stage
enterprises, and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company’s
fiscal year end is 30 June.

Principles
of consolidation

These
interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Dynamic Gravel Holdings
Ltd. (“Dynamic Gravel”), a company incorporated in the
province of Alberta on 21 November 2007. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon
consolidation.

Cash and
cash equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.

Mineral
property costs

The
Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and
development of mineral properties.

Mineral
property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible
assets when purchased. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the
Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment. If proven and
probable reserves are established for a property and it has been
determined that a mineral property can be economically developed,
costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over
the estimated life of the probable reserve.

Mineral
property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.

Estimated
future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are
provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production
basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and
environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management
based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and
technology and industry standards. Any charge is included in
exploration expense or the provision for depletion and depreciation
during the period and the actual restoration expenditures are
charged to the accumulated provision amounts as
incurred.

As of the
date of these interim consolidated financial statements, the
Company has not established any proven or probable reserves on its
mineral properties and incurred only acquisition and exploration
costs (Note 3).

Although
the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties
in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry
standards for the stage of exploration of such properties, these
procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title. Such
properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and
title may be affected by undetected defects.

Financial
instruments

Fair
Value

The
carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and
due to related party approximate their fair values because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

Interest
Rate Risk

The
Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk due to the
short-term maturity of its monetary assets and
liabilities.

Credit
Risk

The
Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and
cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with financial
institutions of high credit worthiness. At times, its cash with a
particular financial institution may exceed any applicable
government insurance limits.

Currency
Risk

The
Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the
balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or
settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances
are included in the determination of income. Foreign currency
transactions are primarily undertaken in Canadian dollars. The
Company has not, to the date of these interim consolidated
financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

Derivative
financial instruments

The
Company has not, to the date of these interim consolidated
financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

Environmental
expenditures

The
operations of the Company have been, and may in the future, be
affected from time to time, in varying degrees, by changes in
environmental regulations, including those for future reclamation
and site restoration costs. Both the likelihood of new regulations
and their overall effect upon the Company vary greatly and are not
predictable. The Company’s policy is to meet or, if possible,
surpass standards set by relevant legislation, by application of
technically proven and economically feasible measures.

Environmental
expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation
programs are charged against earnings as incurred or capitalized
and amortized depending on their future economic benefits.
Estimated future reclamation and site restoration costs, when the
ultimate liability is reasonably determinable, are charged against
earnings over the estimated remaining life of the related business
operation, net of expected recoveries.

Income
taxes

Deferred
income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of
income or expense reported in the consolidated financial statements
and those reported for income tax purposes in accordance with ASC
740, “Income Taxes” , which requires the use of
the asset/liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred
income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and credit
carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The Company provides for deferred taxes for
the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary
differences and carry-forwards when realization is more likely than
not.

Basic and
diluted loss per share

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
260, “Earnings per Share” . ASC 260 requires
presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share
(“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS
is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives
effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during
the period using the treasury stock method and convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted
EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of
stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excluded all dilutive
potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Comprehensive
loss

ASC 220,
“Comprehensive Income” , establishes standards
for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its
components in the interim consolidated financial statements. As at
30 September 2010, the Company has no items that represent a
comprehensive loss and, therefore, has not included a schedule of
comprehensive loss in the interim consolidated financial
statements.

Segments
of an enterprise and related information

ASC 280,
“Segment Reporting” establishes guidance for the
way that public companies report information about operating
segments in interim consolidated financial statements and requires
reporting of selected information about operating segments in
interim consolidated financial statements issued to the public. It
also establishes standards for disclosures regarding products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. ASC 280 defines
operating segments as components of a company about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by
the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Company has evaluated
this Codification and does not believe it is applicable at this
time.

Start-up
expenses

The
Company has adopted ASC 720-15, “Start-Up Costs”
, which requires that costs associated with start-up activities be
expensed as incurred. Accordingly, start-up costs associated with
the Company’s formation have been included in the
Company’s expenses for the period from the date of inception
on 21 January 2004 to 30 September 2010.

Use of
estimates

The
preparation of interim consolidated financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Foreign
currency translation

The
Company’s functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars.
The interim consolidated financial statements of the Company are
translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830, “
Foreign Currency Matters ”. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using
the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Gains and
losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency
denominated transactions or balances are included in the
determination of income. The Company has not, to the date of these
interim consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative
instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations.

Concentration
of credit risk

The
Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of its cash and
cash equivalents and related party payables. The Company places its
cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of high
credit worthiness. At times, its cash and cash equivalents with a
particular financial institution may exceed any applicable
government insurance limits. The Company’s management also
routinely assesses the financial strength and credit worthiness of
any parties to which it extends funds and as such, it believes that
any associated credit risk exposures are limited.

Risks and
uncertainties

The
Company operates in the resource exploration industry that is
subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including
financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated
with operating a resource exploration business, including the
potential risk of business failure.

Comparative
figures

Certain
comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to the current
period’s presentation.

Changes in
accounting policies

In
February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) No. 2010-11, “Derivatives and Hedging
(Topic 815): Scope Exception Related to Embedded Credit
Derivatives” . ASU No. 2010-11 clarifies the type of
embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative
bifurcation requirements. Specifically, only one form of embedded
credit derivative qualifies for the exemption – one that is
related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to
another. As a result, entities that have contracts containing an
embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such
subordination may need to separately account for the embedded
credit derivative feature. The amendments in ASU No. 2010-11 are
effective for each reporting entity at the beginning of its first
fiscal quarter beginning after 15 June 2010. The adoption of ASU
No. 2010-11 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
interim consolidated financial statements.

In June
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, “Accounting for
Transfer of Financial Assets – an amendment of FASB Statement
No.140” . SFAS No. 166 removes the concept of a
qualifying special-purpose entity from ASC 860-10,
“Transfers and Servicing” , and removes the
exception from applying ASC 810-10,
“Consolidation” . This statement also clarifies
the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of
financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting. SFAS No.
166, which is referenced in ASC 105-10-65, has not yet been adopted
into the Codification and remains authoritative. This statement is
effective 1 July 2010. The adoption of SFAS No. 166 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s interim consolidated
financial statements.

In June
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, “Amendments to FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R)” . SFAS No. 167, which amends
ASC 810-10, “Consolidation” , prescribes a
qualitative model for identifying whether a company has a
controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity
(“VIE”) and eliminates the quantitative model. The new
model identifies two primary characteristics of a controlling
financial interest: (1) provides a company with the power to direct
significant activities of the VIE, and (2) obligates a company to
absorb losses of and/or provides rights to receive benefits from
the VIE. SFAS No. 167 requires a company to reassess on an ongoing
basis whether it holds a controlling financial interest in a VIE. A
company that holds a controlling financial interest is deemed to be
the primary beneficiary of the VIE and is required to consolidate
the VIE. SFAS No. 167, which is referenced in ASC 105-10-65, has
not yet been adopted into the Codification and remains
authoritative. SFAS No. 167 is effective 1 July 2010. The adoption
of SFAS No. 167 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s interim consolidated financial
statements.

Recent
accounting pronouncements

In
February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09,
“Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure
Requirements” , which eliminates the requirement for
Securities and Exchange Commission filers to disclose the date
through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events. ASU No.
2010-09 is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after 15
December 2010. The adoption of ASU No. 2010-09 is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company’s interim consolidated
financial statements.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Improving
Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements”. This update
requires additional disclosure within the roll forward of activity
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, including transfers of assets and liabilities between Level
1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the separate
presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of
assets and liabilities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
In addition, the update requires enhanced disclosures of the
valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements
within Levels 2 and 3. The new disclosure requirements are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after 15
December 2009, except for the disclosure of purchases, sales,
issuances and settlements of Level 3 measurements. Those
disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after 15
December 2010. As ASU 2010-06 only requires enhanced disclosures,
the Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will
have a material effect on its interim consolidated financial
statements.

Unproven
Mineral Properties  




 

During
the year ended 30 June 2008, the Company acquired, through its
wholly owned subsidiary, a 100% undivided rights, title and
interest in and to two gravel claims called the Northern Gravel
Claims and Super Mammoth Gravel Claims (the “Super Mammoth
Gravel Project”) situated along the Homfray Channel at Lloyd
Point on the south coast of British Columbia, Canada for $25,000.
The Super Mammoth Gravel Project consists of two mineral claim
tenures that are approximately 124.1 hectares (“ha”)
each in size (total 248.2 ha). The claims are currently in good
standing until their respective anniversary dates which are 6
November 2014 (Northern Gravel Claims) and 19 January 2015 (Super
Mammoth Claim). The acquisition cost of $25,000 was initially
capitalized as a tangible asset. During the year ended 30 June
2008, the Company recorded a write-down of mineral property
acquisition costs of $25,000 related to the Super Mammoth Gravel
Project.

Income
Taxes  




 

The
Company has losses carried forward for income tax purposes to 30
September 2010. There are no current or deferred tax expenses for
the three month period ended 30 September 2010 due to the
Company’s loss position. The Company has fully reserved for
any benefits of these losses. The deferred tax consequences of
temporary differences in reporting items for financial statement
and income tax purposes are recognized, as appropriate. Realization
of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is
dependent on many factors, including the Company’s ability to
generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward
period. Management has considered these factors in reaching its
conclusion as to the valuation allowance for financial reporting
purposes.
