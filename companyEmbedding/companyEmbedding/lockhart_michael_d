 Educational Background



Master's Degree 


University of Chicago - Booth School of Business

                  The University of Chicago Booth School of Business is a graduate business school located in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Chicago. Formerly known as the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago Booth is the second-oldest business school in the U.S., the first such school to offer an Executive MBA program, and the first to initiate a Ph.D. program in business. The school was renamed in 2008 following a $300 million endowment gift to the school by alumnus David G. Booth. The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school.

The school's flagship campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on the main campus of the university. The school also maintains additional campuses in London and Asia (originally Singapore, but in July 2013 a move to Hong Kong was announced), as well as in downtown Chicago on the Magnificent Mile. In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of finance, economics, quantitative marketing research, and accounting. Chicago Booth is currently ranked first in the United States by Bloomberg Businessweek and first globally by the Economist.

Title: Senior Analyst and Research Scientist In Environmental Engineering
               Company: GSI Energy Inc
Job Details
               General Synfuels International, Inc. ("GSI") is committed to delivering a green transformation for fossil fuels development. GSI has developed a patented, environmentally friendly, energy-self-sustaining and economically attractive process to recover oil and gas products from oil shale. It is GSI's intent to demonstrate its technology in the field through a commercially scalable prototype. GSI will be well positioned to become a significant contributor to the Oil Shale Industry in the United States and around the world. The GSI in-situ gasification technology will reduce reliance on oil imports to the U.S. by responsibly tapping into the abundant domestic energy resources of the United States.
Title: Chief Scientist
               Company: Earth Search Sciences , Inc.
Job Details
               Earth Search Sciences, Inc.'s (OTCBB:ESSE) revolutionary hyperspectral technology provides the ability to accurately read the chemical properties of surface substances from great altitudes and produce easily interpreted maps allowing the user to identify specific minerals and substances on the surface of the earth by their diagnostic reflectance patterns. Ultimately, this remote sensing capability identifies a greater number of exploration targets quickly and economically, monitors the environmental situation, and improves the probability of finding anomalies. Older, more conventional methods would take decades to cover the same area, and at a much greater cost. Within the realm of exploration, remote sensing does not replace the need for geological knowledge, geochemistry, geophysics, seismic, drilling, etc., which are some of the more conventional tools used for exploration.

        Armstrong names new CEO  
    


TIM MEKEEL Staff Writer

Matthew J. Espe



































For the second time in 10 years, Armstrong World Industries has reached outside the company - and its industry - to find its new leader.Armstrong said Friday it has hired Matthew J. Espe as its next president and chief executive officer, effective in late July.Espe, 51, of Newtown Square, will fill the posts last held by Michael D. Lockhart, who stepped down in February.
Espe is chairman and CEO of Ricoh Americas Corp., which makes office equipment such as copiers, printers and scanners. It's a subsidiary of Ricoh Co.Before that, he was chairman and CEO of IKON Office Solutions, a $4 billion office equipment firm, which Ricoh acquired in 2008.Prior to his eight years with IKON and Ricoh, Espe spent 22 years with General Electric, leading units in Europe, Asia and North America.Ultimately he became president and CEO of GE Lighting.Like Lockhart, himself a former GE executive, Espe is coming to Armstrong as a newcomer to its lines of business.Those lines are designing, manufacturing and selling floors, ceilings and cabinets.They also are the only two people in Armstrong's 150-year history to take its helm from outside the company, rather than being promoted from within.But Armstrong Chairman James J. O'Connor said Espe has shown the skills he'll need to be a successful leader of the Lancaster-based firm.In a prepared statement, O'Connor said:"Matt brings a proven track record of placing a strong focus on customer service and profitable growth and is ideally suited to lead Armstrong into its next phase of growth."Matt is an experienced executive who knows how to run large organizations efficiently and effectively."Espe, in a prepared statement, said:"I'm privileged to be joining such a talented team whose dedication has produced an industry leader known for quality products and superior customer service."I'm looking forward to what we can do together to build on that success."Espe said the decision to leave Ricoh Americas "was an extremely difficult one."He pointed to "all the great employees and the opportunities we have to build on our leadership position in the industry."The opportunity to become the CEO of Armstrong, however, was a great fit, and one that I could not ignore," Espe said.Espe was praised for his contributions to Ricoh Americas, of West Caldwell, N.J., by Kevin Togashi, the CEO of its parent firm, Ricoh Americas Holdings."Matt has provided outstanding leadership and direction to our organization … with a focus on increasing our market share and improving our business going forward," Togashi said.As president and CEO of Armstrong, Espe will lead a firm that posted $2.8 billion in sales last year and has 10,600 employees, including 1,800 here.Espe's compensation will be generous and multifaceted, according to an Armstrong filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.He will receive a $980,000 annual salary and, assuming he's still on the job Nov. 1, a $3.45 million bonus, the filing said.In addition, Espe will get stock options valued at $3.5 million and restricted stock units valued at $2.6 million.Beyond that, he'll also be eligible for an annual cash bonus of 100 percent to 200 percent of his salary and various Armstrong long-term incentive plans.The Armstrong board plans to name Espe a director after his appointment as CEO becomes effective. O'Connor will continue as chairman.Espe, a graduate of the University of Idaho, holds an MBA degree from Whittier College. Besides leading Ricoh Americas, Espe is a director of Unisys and Graphic Packaging Holding Co.tmekeel@lnpnews.com
