We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Supreme Court of Montana.
BRESNAN COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, Plaintiff and Appellee, v. STATE of Montana, DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, Defendant and Appellant.
No. DA 12–0569.
    Decided: December 02, 2013

		For Appellant: David R. Stewart, Courtney Jenkins (argued), Teresa G. Whitney, Special Assistant Attorney Generals, Montana Department of Revenue, Legal Services Office; Helena, Montana. For Appellee: Robert L. Sterup (argued), Kyle Anne Gray, Shane P. Coleman, Holland & Hart LLP; Billings, Montana.
¶ 1 The State of Montana Department of Revenue (Department) appeals the order of the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, that determined that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive assessments on Bresnan Communications, LLC (Bresnan). The Department also appeals the separate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order that determined that Bresnan owns exclusively class eight cable television system properties under § 15–6–138(l)(k), MCA. We reverse and remand.¶ 2 We address the following issues on appeal:1. Whether the District Court properly determined that Bresnan owned exclusively class eight property?2. Whether the District Court properly concluded that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments?PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND¶ 3 Bresnan challenged the Department's decision to tax Bresnan as a single entity rather than allowing Bresnan to apportion unilaterally its assets among tax classifications. Bresnan is a Delaware Limited Liability Company that operates in Montana. Bresnan purchased the cable television network infrastructure in Montana that is at the center of this dispute in 2003.¶ 4 Bresnan's 2003 network was typical of cable systems. The “headend” of that network received and broadcasted data that Bresnan chose. The headend broadcasted data over the “trunk cable,” the industry name for the networked cable system that connected Bresnan's data feed to each customer's neighborhood. Once the data reached a customer's neighborhood, the “feeder cable” transmitted data throughout the neighborhood. Each individual customer had a “drop cable” that connected the feeder cable to the customer's home. The drop cable connected to the customer's “terminal equipment.” The terminal equipment, commonly known as the set-top box, interpreted which data to play on a television.¶ 5 Bresnan began to upgrade the network's infrastructure to include new services shortly after the purchase. Bresnan sought to integrate services beyond basic television programming. Bresnan wanted to bundle expanded cable programming (cable), on-demand video services, high-speed internet data services (internet), and voice-over internet protocol telephony services (VoIP). Bresnan labels these services its “Triple Play” package. The upgrades necessary to include these services altered Bresnan's network from its 2003 form.¶ 6 Bresnan's expert accounting and valuation report describes Bresnan's “significant investment in system engineering, costly new equipment, upgraded distribution plant, and installation labor” in order to expand its cable programming. Bresnan improved its satellite receiver dishes, installed signal combiners, optical laser transmission equipment, and added optical fiber between the headend and feeder cable distribution nodes. Bresnan invested in video-on-demand servers and upgraded distribution node equipment. Bresnan also distributed new set-top boxes to customers.¶ 7 Bresnan made additional investments to prepare its system for internet services following its cable upgrade. Bresnan made business arrangements to provide connection to the internet and upgraded its physical system to affect the addition of internet services. Physical upgrades included data switches in each headend to interface with the internet connections in Seattle and Denver, local data servers in main headends, and a “Cable Modem Termination System” (CMTS).¶ 8 The CMTS allowed Bresnan to combine the internet data with the cable data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan's system. Bresnan also provided cable modems to subscribers who purchased internet service. To achieve the transfer of internet service to its customers, Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables.¶ 9 Bresnan upgraded its network further to provide VoIP residential telephone services. Bresnan contracted with Net2Phone, a joint venture partner, to effect this upgrade. Net2Phone provided most of the necessary capital and software to bring about residential VoIP capabilities. Bresnan provided use of the CMTS to combine the residential VoIP data with the cable and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan's network. Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of residential VoIP service to its customers.¶ 10 Bresnan also engaged in the “[s]ystem [h]ardening” process for its network after upgrades to enable residential voice services. System hardening included further physical changes to Bresnan's network. Specifically, Bresnan installed battery backups and other unspecified equipment to identify and reduce interference for residential VoIP service. System hardening reduced interference that specifically would have affected the data and VoIP traffic on its network.¶ 11 Bresnan made further upgrades to enable commercial VoIP. These upgrades included new switches in select headends and data servers for commercial subscriber voicemail services. Bresnan used the CMTS to combine the commercial VoIP data with residential VoIP, cable, and internet data into a single electrical signal for transfer over Bresnan's network. Bresnan used both the CMTS and the recently-installed signal combiners, optical fiber between headends and distribution nodes, and existing drop cables to achieve the transfer of commercial VoIP service to its customers.¶ 12 Bresnan lastly began to provide the same terminal equipment to customers in 2010, without consideration of which services the customer had purchased from Bresnan. This new terminal equipment provided an integrated experience to customers. Regardless of which services the customer had purchased from Bresnan, all data arrived into a single piece of terminal equipment. The single terminal equipment processed that data and delivered the appropriate service to the customer.¶ 13 Although Bresnan functionally had bundled its Triple Play services for consumers, Bresnan segregated each service for taxation purposes. Montana imposes an excise tax upon voice services, such as Bresnan's telephony operations. Section 15–53–128 et seq., MCA. Montana imposes no excise taxes upon cable television or high speed internet. Section 15–53–128 et seq., MCA. Bresnan paid separate franchise fees to local governments for the right to install its cable television system in public rights of way. Bresnan needed to pay no franchise fees, however, for high speed internet or telephony.¶ 14 The Montana legislature amended the Montana tax code in 1999 to include language central to this dispute. The amendment specifically incorporated “telecommunications services” into the tax code when it created an assessment classification for “telecommunications services companies.” Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA (2001). The Department would for the first time assess centrally allocations of “telecommunications services companies” under the new amendment. Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA (2001). Comments at the hearings on the bill show that the bill's sponsor intended to provide a tax decrease from the pre–1999 assessment and taxation rates for “the assets of telecommunications” in future telecommunications developments. Mont. Sen. Tax. Comm., Hearing on HB 174, 1999 Legis., Reg. Sess. 11–13 (Apr. 12, 1999).¶ 15 Montana's administrative rules require the Department to value centrally reported property through the unit method of valuation. Admin. R.M. 42.22.111 (2011). Unit valuation considers the market value of the company as a functional whole instead of the value of individual components. Whether a taxpayer uses local filing, as compared to central filing, dictates the method that the Department uses to value property.¶ 16 Bresnan unilaterally apportioned company assets when Bresnan made its tax reports in order to segregate its property. Bresnan used centralized, statewide reporting for its voice operations. Bresnan included roughly 10% of company assets in its voice operation tax declaration. Bresnan reported voice operations as “Bresnan Digital Services, LLC” doing business as “Montana Telephony” from 2007 to 2009. Bresnan also centrally reported its microwave satellite operations as a portion of the same 10% of company assets. The Department had classified Bresnan's voice operations as class thirteen property from 2007 to 2009 because the voice operations were “allocations of [a] centrally assessed telecommunications and services compan[y].” The class thirteen classification resulted in a 6% centralized assessment on Bresnan's voice property.¶ 17 Bresnan included the remaining 90% of its assets in locally reported cable and internet properties assessments as “Bresnan Communications, LLC.” Local communities assessed Bresnan's cable and internet properties from 2007 to 2009. Local assessments resulted in a 3% local assessment on cable and internet properties. The Department knew of Bresnan's decision to report its cable and internet properties for local assessment as class eight properties from 2007 to 2009.¶ 18 The Department audited Bresnan in December 2008 for tax years 2007 and 2008. The Department determined upon completion of the audit in August 2009 that Bresnan should report its property as a single entity rather than as three separate entities. The Department informed Bresnan that Montana law required the Department to assess Bresnan centrally as one unit, and to classify Bresnan's property under class thirteen as allocations of a centrally assessed telecommunications services company.¶ 19 The Department issued revised assessments for Bresnan for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009 following the audit. The Department's revised assessments centrally assessed all of Bresnan's property under class thirteen. The Department submitted the revised assessments to Bresnan. Bresnan paid parts of the assessments under protest.¶ 20 The Department similarly assessed Bresnan centrally on May 26, 2010, as one unit for the 2010 tax year. The 2010 assessment subjected all of Bresnan's Montana properties to class thirteen central assessment at a 6% tax rate.  Section 15–6–156(4), MCA. The reclassification increased Bresnan's tax burden from $1,711,365 in tax year 2009 to $7,337,692 in tax year 2010. Bresnan filed this declaratory judgment action in response on July 28, 2010.¶ 21 Bresnan sought to prevent the Department from issuing revised assessments of Bresnan for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Bresnan also sought to prevent the Department from issuing any other revised assessments. Bresnan additionally sought a declaration that the Department illegally had assessed all of Bresnan's property as class thirteen property. Bresnan further asked the District Court to require the Department to refund taxes that Bresnan had paid under protest. Bresnan lastly challenged the legality of the Department's method of assessment for the 2010 tax year.¶ 22 The District Court granted Bresnan's motion for summary judgment on the Department's ability to issue retroactive assessments in a written order on September 26, 2011. The District Court conducted a bench trial on October 24, 2011. The District Court concluded that Bresnan owned class eight properties. The District Court directed the Department to refund with interest the payments that Bresnan had made under protest. The District Court also vacated the Department's retroactive assessments of Bresnan. The Department appeals.STANDARD OF REVIEW¶ 23 We review for clear error a district court's findings of fact. Roland v. Davis, 2013 MT 148, ¶ 21, 370 Mont. 327, 302 P .3d 91. Clear error exists if substantial, credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact, if the district court misapprehended the evidence's effect, or if we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. Roland, ¶ 21. We review for correctness a district court's conclusions of law. Roland, ¶ 21. We review de novo a district court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment.  Bailey v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2013 MT 119, ¶ 18, 370 Mont. 73, 300 P.3d 1149.DISCUSSION¶ 24 Whether the District Court properly determined that Bresnan owned exclusively class eight property?¶ 25 We first address whether Montana law allows the Department to classify Bresnan's property in class eight or class thirteen. Montana law defines class eight properties to include “cable television systems.” Section 15–6–138(1)(k), MCA. Montana taxes class eight properties at 3%. Section 15–6–138(3), MCA. Class thirteen properties comprise “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies.” Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. Montana taxes class thirteen property at “6% of its market value.”  Section 15–6–156(4), MCA.¶ 26 These statutory definitions pose the question of whether Bresnan's property should be classified as a “cable television system” or a “telecommunications services company.” The District Court concluded as a matter of law that Bresnan's property qualified as a “cable television system.” The District Court evaluated Bresnan's “[o]ne-way transmission of video programming,” “set of closed transmission paths,” and “system that receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations” to reach its conclusion. The District Court relied both on the legislature's definition of a “cable television system,” and the language in Bresnan's Montana Cable Television Franchise Agreements that matched the language in the Federal Cable Act. Bresnan fit the definition of a cable television system under these factors.¶ 27 The District Court further concluded as a matter of law that “Bresnan's addition of voice and data services did not change the character of its cable television systems.” The District Court relied upon the Department's apparent failure to “reconcile the necessity of Franchise Agreements for Bresnan to deliver its video programming” with the Department's contention that “Bresnan, as a whole, is a telecommunications company.” The District Court applied a use test to measure Bresnan's “PPE [property, plant, and equipment], bandwidth, subscribers, or revenue” to “conclude that Bresnan owns property subject to [c]lass [e]ight property taxation.”¶ 28 The Department challenges the District Court's focus on Bresnan's physical attributes to the exclusion of the use and productivity of Bresnan's property. The Department alleges that the District Court erroneously considered only “a portion of [Bresnan's] use and productivity.” The Department argues that the District Court should have evaluated Bresnan's classification based upon Bresnan's use of all of its property and the productivity that results from that use. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Powell Cnty., 76 Mont. 596, 599, 247 P. 1096, 1097 (1926); Wheir v. Dye, 105 Mont. 347, 73 P.2d 209 (1937). The Department further takes issue with the District Court's lack of “analysis on the physical attributes or use and productivity of Bresnan's internet property.”¶ 29 The District Court relied heavily upon our decision in Omimex Canada, Ltd. v. State Dep't of Revenue, 2008 MT 403, 347 Mont. 176, 201 P.3d 3. In Omimex, we considered whether a natural gas company's property fell within § 15–6–141(1)(b), MCA (2007). Omimex, ¶ 17. Section 15–6–141(1)(b), MCA (2007), encompasses “allocations for centrally assessed natural gas companies having a major distribution system in this state.” Omimex's lack of a major distribution system within Montana excluded it from § 15–6–141(1)(b), MCA (2007). Omimex, ¶ 26.¶ 30 “[C]able television systems” comprise class class eight property.  Section 15–6–138(1)(k), MCA. “[A]llocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” comprise class thirteen properties.  Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. Neither classification statute contains the requirement that a taxpayer have “a major distribution system in this state,” similar to the provision in § 15–6–141(1)(b), MCA (2007), at issue in Omimex. This physical attribute requirement in Omimex—in the form of a major distribution system—remains unique for purposes of property tax classification statutes. Not surprisingly, Omimex represents the sole case where we have determined that the physical attributes of a taxpayer's property alone govern property tax classification. Omimex, ¶ 26.¶ 31 The District Court's analysis focused upon a physical attribute of Bresnan's property—the transfer of electrical data signals. Physical attributes do not represent the standard that Montana courts use to classify property. The District Court's focus upon the physical attributes of Bresnan's network confines the Department's ability to classify Bresnan's entire property in proportion “to its use, its productivity, its utility, [and] its general setting in the economic organization of society.” Yellowstone Pipe Line Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 138 Mont. 603, 621, 358 P.2d 55, 64 (1960). The physical attributes of Bresnan's property and the productivity that results from the use of that property represent the proper metric to classify Bresnan.  Wheir, 105 Mont. at 354–55, 73 P.2d at 213.¶ 32 Bresnan argues that we should uphold the District Court's conclusion regardless because Bresnan qualifies as a “cable television system” under the definition of a rural cooperative utility cable television system, “that receives and amplifies the signals broadcast by one or more television stations.” Section 35–18–102, MCA. Bresnan cites to its cable franchise agreements with Montana cities to bolster its position. Bresnan also correctly identifies that both parties' experts agree that Bresnan operates a cable television system. The Department concedes “that Bresnan's systems are capable, at least in part, of these utilities.”¶ 33 This definition of a “cable television system” fails to capture all of the uses to which Bresnan puts its network. Nothing restricts the use and productivity of Bresnan's network to the delivery of an electrical data signal only for cable television. Bresnan's expert report from Dr. Walter Stanley Ciciora describes cable as the “predominant,” but not exclusive, “use of even the most technologically advanced cable television systems today.” Bresnan's accounting and valuation report describes a “multi-million dollar commitment to enhance[ ] [cable] that required a significant investment in system engineering, costly new equipment, upgraded distribution plant, and installation labor.” That same report describes additional investments “needed to provide data services” and “needed to provide V[o]IP residential telephony services,” as well as the “incremental cost of enabling commercial V[o]IP services.” Dr. Ciciora concluded that “[m]ost of [Bresnan's] cable television systems are technologically advanced, providing cable television programming, and high speed data and voice.”¶ 34 Bresnan altered its network from one with the limited ability to broadcast only cable in 2003, to the multi-service capable network at issue in this litigation. Bresnan's argument that its network operates exclusively a “cable television system” denies the obvious fact of the actual use and productivity of Bresnan's upgraded network. This upgraded network, combined with Bresnan's attendant property, has expanded Bresnan's operation beyond a “cable television system” as defined by any section of the Montana code, including § 15–6–138(1)(k), MCA.¶ 35 Various provisions within Title 15 and the administrative rules of Montana explain what constitutes a telecommunications services provider for property tax purposes. We must construe statutes that address the same subject matter and that are consistent with one another to ensure that all statutes have effect. Mountain W. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hall, 2001 MT 314, ¶ 23, 308 Mont. 29, 38 P.3d 825.¶ 36 “[A]llocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” comprise class thirteen properties. Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. The definitions section of Title 15 defines the parameters of a telecommunications services company. A “telecommunications services provider” offers retail telecommunications services. Section 15–53–129(14), MCA.  “Retail telecommunications,” in turn, involve “the two-way transmission of voice, image, data, or other information over wire, cable, fiber optics, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities that originates or terminates in this state and is charged to a customer with a Montana service address.” Section 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA.¶ 37 The administrative rules of Montana clarify that a “telecommunications service provider” includes “a telecommunication services company or a person providing retail telecommunication services as provided in 15–53–129, MCA.” Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(31) (2011). The administrative rules further define “telecommunications for property tax purposes ” as “the transmission of information between or among points specified by the user. The transmission must be without change in the form or content as sent and received. The transmission includes all related services associated with providing the information by the telecommunication service provider.” Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(30) (2011) (emphasis added). We construe these statutes and regulations on the same subject matter so that all statutes have effect.  Mountain W. Farm Bureau, ¶ 23.¶ 38 Title 15 and administrative rules, taken together, confirm that “for property tax purposes,” Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(30) (2011), a class thirteen “telecommunication services compan[y],” § 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA, “provid[es] retail telecommunication services.” Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(31) (2011). A “telecommunications services provider,” § 15–53–129(14), MCA, in turn, offers “[r]etail telecommunications.” Section 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA. Bresnan provides “voice,” “data,” and “other information” over “fiber optic” cable to its customers. Section 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA. Data and voice are “related services associated” with Bresnan's original network that historically provided only cable. Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(30) (2011).¶ 39 Bresnan's transmissions terminate in the homes of “customer[s] with a Montana service address” in twenty counties. Section 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA. Bresnan uses its network to provide cable, to provide data, and to provide voice services. Section 15–53–129(14), MCA. Bresnan's activities constitute “retail telecommunications” and “telecommunications” under both Title 15 and the administrative rules. Section 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA; Admin. R.M. 42.22.101(30) (2011).¶ 40 The Montana legislature has seen fit to define a class thirteen telecommunication services company in a manner that encompasses distribution networks whose owners use the capacity of that network to provide voice, cable, and data electrical signals to subscribers over that single distribution system. Sections 15–53–129(14), –129(10)(a), MCA. We decline to parse the number and type of electrical data signals that Bresnan transmits over its network or the allocations of the network's physical elements when the use and productivity of the network as a whole fits the statutory definition of a telecommunications network. An analysis of the use and productivity of Bresnan's entire network results in the inescapable conclusion that Bresnan uses a single transmission line to deliver three separate services. This analysis imparts the Department with the authority to classify Bresnan's property accordingly under class thirteen as a telecommunication service.  Powell Cnty., 76 Mont. at 599, 247 P. at 1097; Wheir, 105 Mont. at 347, 73 P.2d at 213.¶ 41 The legislature's exemption of certain properties from class thirteen further supports this outcome. The expression of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another. Omimex, ¶ 21. The legislature explicitly excluded from class thirteen any class five property owned by an organization that provides telecommunications services. Section 15–6–156(2)(f), MCA. This express exclusion of class five property implies that the legislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen. Section 15–6–156(2)(f), MCA. If the legislature had intended to exclude class eight “cable television systems” from class thirteen, the legislature could have added the additional language of “and under 15–6–138 [class eight]” to the class thirteen exemptions. Section 15–6–156(2)(f), MCA. The legislature did not do so.¶ 42 To limit Bresnan's classification to a “cable television service” fails to achieve the purpose of Montana's taxation classification statutes. Statutory definitions and administrative guidelines taken together, and in the absence of an applicable exclusion, make clear that Bresnan's use and productivity fits the definition of a “telecommunication services provider.” Bresnan, as a result, remains subject to assessment under class thirteen.¶ 43 The Dissent argues that the Department's failure to value Bresnan's property in different classes “disregards the basic premise of our property classification system.” Dissent, ¶ 65. Nothing in the classification statutes requires, however, that the Department apportion Bresnan's property among Montana's various property tax classifications. This Court previously has defined “allocation” for taxation purposes as “the process of attributing to the taxing state the value of a portion of an interstate system for tax purposes.” Yellowstone Pipe Line Co., 138 Mont. at 612, 358 P.2d at 60. The class thirteen definition of “allocations of centrally assessed telecommunications services companies” requires only that the Department consider all of Bresnan's property located within Montana for taxation purposes. Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA; Yellowstone Pipe Line Co., 138 Mont. at 612, 358 P.2d at 60. This decision allows the Department to address properly “an administrative matter within its broad discretion.” State v. Hornstein, 2010 MT 75, ¶ 16, 356 Mont. 14, 229 P.3d 1206.¶ 44 The Dissent further argues that the overwhelming use of Bresnan's property takes the form of “one-way transmission that receives and amplifies television broadcast signals.” Dissent, ¶ 67. The Department's audit of Bresnan revealed, however, that very little of Bresnan's use of its system involves exclusively cable television that relies on one-way transmissions that receive and amplify broadcast signals. In fact, most of Bresnan's system, as currently used, has the capacity to support the two-way transmission of electrical data signals. The operation of a “telecommunications services compan[y],” involves the two-way transmission of electrical data signals. Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. The Department's audit of Bresnan confirms that “Bresnan upgraded their equipment and lines to two-way transmission capacity, fiber optic in most cases, to offer many of their advanced services that are available today.”¶ 45 Our determination that the Department appropriately classified the use and productivity of Bresnan's property under class thirteen instead of class eight requires us to analyze the assessment of class thirteen property. The District Court determined that central assessment did not apply to Bresnan. The District Court exempted Bresnan from central assessment based upon its determination that Bresnan qualified as a class eight “cable television system.” The District Court further reasoned that the central assessment statute, § 15–23–101, MCA, “omits any reference to cable television system [s].” A class thirteen classification, conversely, denotes by its terms “centrally assessed telecommunications services companies.” Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. Bresnan's qualification as a telecommunications service company requires us to determine whether class thirteen classification of Bresnan would be appropriate under the “centrally assessed” element of § 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA.¶ 46 Montana law requires the Department to assess centrally “property owned by a corporation ․ operating a single and continuous property operated in more than one county.” Section 15–23–101(2), MCA. Properties that enjoy a unity of ownership and devotion to a single use qualify as single and continuous properties. W. Union Tel. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 91 Mont. 310, 322–23, 7 P.2d 551, 552–53 (1932). “Single and continuous” properties are functionally integrated over a wide area and enjoy a unity of use and management. W. Union Tel. Co., 91 Mont. at 322–23, 7 P.2d at 552–53.¶ 47 Bresnan operates a single and continuous network in the twenty Montana counties where Bresnan delivers three services. Bresnan operates in an integrated fashion. Bresnan's customers pay one bill for the purchase of all three services. Bresnan manages its operations from the Network Operations Center in Billings. Customers use a single piece of terminal equipment. Bresnan owns class thirteen property in those locations where Bresnan operates a single transmission line to deliver three services to customers. Bresnan fits the statutory definition of a property that the Department must assess centrally.  Section 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA.¶ 48 Whether the District Court properly concluded that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments?¶ 49 We next address whether the Department possessed authority to issue revised assessments for Bresnan's property for tax years 2007, 2008, and 2009. The District Court determined that § 15–8–601(b), MCA, controlled its analysis. The District Court interpreted our revised assessment case law to allow reassessment only in circumstances where there had been a clerical error or a ministerial mistake. The District Court determined that our case law foreclosed reassessments “made to comport with a change in assessor judgment” to avoid impermissible prejudice to the taxpayer.¶ 50 The District Court reasoned that the Department's shift away from Bresnan's prior income statement and balance sheet to a centralized assessment represented a shift in assessor judgment. The District Court concluded that the “change in appraisal judgment” placed the Department's reassessment “outside the definition of an—‘erroneous assessment’ “ allowed under § 15–8–601, MCA. The Department argues that it “lacked the information necessary to make a determination on central assessment before its audit of Bresnan.” The Department contends that it “performed unit valuations on Bresnan for tax years 2007–2009” upon discovery of “the information necessary to make a determination on central assessment.”¶ 51 The Department points out that none of our revised assessment cases “involve[d] centrally assessed property.” The authority to issue revised assessments is critical because appraisers must “annually test whether a property requires central assessment.” The Department contends that restraint on its ability to “exercise judgment to determine whether the property requires central assessment” would render the Department unable to perform its duty under Montana law.¶ 52 We have defined the contours of revised assessments only twice. We determined first in Evans Products Co. v. Missoula Cnty., 201 Mont. 337, 342, 654 P.2d 523, 526 (1982), that “a clerical error falls under the plain language meaning of ‘erroneous assessment’ as it is used in section 15–8–601, MCA.” Evans Products, 201 Mont. at 342, 654 P.2d at 526. We further noted that “[t]he bulk of authority and prior Montana case law suggest that appraisal, the setting of market value, is an integral part of the taxation process.” Evans Products, 201 Mont. at 343, 654 P.2d at 526. This Court analyzed revised assessments more recently in Kruse v. Cascade Cnty., 244 Mont. 126, 796 P.2d 568 (1990). We clarified in Kruse that “[p]roperty which has not been fully taxed according to appropriate tax procedures may be properly reassessed.” Kruse, 244 Mont. at 129, 796 P.2d at 570.¶ 53 Neither Evans Products, nor Kruse, specifically examined revised assessments in the context of property that must be assessed centrally.  Evans Products and Kruse make clear, however, that § 15–8–601, MCA, allows the Department to reassess property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures. Evans Products, 201 Mont. at 343, 654 P.2d at 526; Kruse, 244 Mont. at 129, 796 P.2d at 570. Unit valuation involves a specific type of appraisal. Appraisal represents an “integral part of the taxation process.” Evans Products, 201 Mont. at 343, 654 P.2d at 526. The Department logically possesses the authority under § 15–8–601, MCA, to reassess property subject to central assessment when the Department determines that such property has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures.¶ 54 The Department must “discover” property that has escaped assessment before it has authority to issue a revised assessment. Section 15–8–601(b), MCA. Many taxpayers in Montana, including Bresnan, self-report their assets into different assessment classes. A more thorough look at the taxpayer's property through an audit constitutes the only vehicle for the Department to “discover” property that has escaped assessment when the taxpayer self-reports. The Department completed its audit of Bresnan in 2009.¶ 55 The Department's audit revealed that Bresnan should be classified properly as a class thirteen “telecommunication services provider.” This reclassification resulted in Bresnan being subject to central assessment. The audit further revealed past improper classification of property on the part of Bresnan. This improper classification apparently arose through Bresnan's self-reporting of its assets. The historic improper classification of Bresnan's property represents property that escaped full taxation according to appropriate tax procedures. Section 15–8–601(b), MCA.¶ 56 The Department's audit determined that Bresnan's allocations of percentages of its property as cable, data, or voice failed to “appropriately represent the operations of the segments.” The property that Bresnan had classified as “telecommunications services” property contained only that property dedicated exclusively to voice service. Bresnan had classified the remaining lion's share of its property as “cable television services.” This substantially larger portion included any property that involved cable or data in any way. The audit found that “[u]sing this methodology [Bresnan's] [c]able operations are overstated and [t]elephony is understated.”¶ 57 Kory Hofland (Hofland) worked as the unit manager of centrally assessed and industrial properties at the Department. Bresnan deposed Hofland. Hofland described property that had not been taxed fully. Hofland identified that Bresnan had limited its property that would be assessed centrally by “only reporting [to class thirteen] property of a receiver of [Bresnan's] services that only had telephony.” Hofland explained that “[i]f that recipient subscribed to telephony and [i]nternet, they weren't [reported] in the telephony portion.” Hofland similarly explained that “[i]f they subscribed to telephony and cable, they weren't in [Bresnan's telephony reporting].” Hofland expressed further concerns about Bresnan's lack of backup to “audited financial data” with regard to Bresnan's historic reporting arrangement.¶ 58 The Department's audit of Bresnan and Hofland's testimony indicate that the audit of Bresnan enabled the Department to discover property that had not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures. The Department reclassified Bresnan as a class thirteen telecommunication services provider, subject to central assessment, in order to value the full property taxes due on Bresnan's property. Section 15–8–601, MCA, grants the Department the authority to issue a revised assessment of Bresnan in order to capture the value of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures.¶ 59 Bresnan challenges the Department's decision to issue a revised assessment as the result of a “change in assessor judgment.” Evidence in the record directly contradicts Bresnan's argument. The Department's discovery and subsequent reclassification arose from the audit's revelation of inaccuracies in Bresnan's self-classification. We decline to characterize the discovery of property that has not been taxed fully according to appropriate tax procedures due to a misclassification on the taxpayer's part as a mere “change in assessor judgment.” We will not presume Bresnan's bad faith in self-allocation. We similarly will not tie the Department's hands simply because it discovered the improper classification through an audit when the taxpayer self-reports.¶ 60 We reverse the decision of the District Court. We remand and direct the District Court to enter a judgment consistent with this opinion.¶ 61 The Court eschews any attempt to analyze the extensive record evidence and instead relies heavily on the presumption that because Bresnan provides some telecommunications services, nearly all of its property can be assessed by the Department under class thirteen. I believe that the Court has disregarded the plain wording and intent of Montana's property classification statutes and failed to properly apply the “physical attributes” and “use and productivity” tests.¶ 62 The proper application of these tests results in companies being taxed under multiple property classes, depending on the use of their property. The District Court extensively analyzed and entered findings about this system, including the property tax classifications applied to companies such as Montana Dakota Utilities, Northwestern Energy, Avista Corporation, Portland General Corporation, and Yellowstone Valley Electric Cooperative, all of which are taxed in multiple classes. More specifically, regarding the telecommunications industry, the District Court found that “[t]elecommunications companies that report for central assessment under Class Thirteen also report and are assessed locally for certain of their Montana property under Class Eight, including Sprint Nextel, Qwest, and CenturyTel.” The court found that the Cable & Communications Corporation, a company that provides cellular telephone and cable television services, “reports its cellular telephone properties for central assessment under Class Thirteen while reporting its cable television properties for local assessment under Class Eight.”¶ 63 Regarding Bresnan, the District Court found from the extensive evidence presented that “[o]ver 97% of Bresnan's Montana bandwidth is used exclusively for the one-way transmission of video programming.” Further, “[s]tate-wide, 917 [of Bresnan's] channels were devoted exclusively to the one-way transmission of video programming, while 26 channels were devoted to voice/data, and 28 channels were used for Video-on-demand (which also is one-way video transmission).”1 To summarize its lengthy findings, the court found that Bresnan's properties “primarily were and are used to provide the one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming .” The District Court's findings are supported by substantial evidence and have not been overturned. The Court's approach is simply to assume that because Bresnan has telecommunications capabilities, the Department is authorized to tax nearly all of its property under class thirteen.¶ 64 Turning to the statutes, we are to start with the principle that “[t]ax statutes must be construed in favor of the taxpayer.” Omimex, ¶ 25. The statutes make clear that holding commercial property that facilitates the two-way transmission of voice, image, and data qualifies an entity as a telecommunications services company. See § 15–53–129(10)(a), MCA (“Retail telecommunications” means “the two-way transmission of voice, image, data, or other information over wire, cable, fiber optics, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities that originates or terminates in this state”). Indeed, the Court correctly notes that by definition, “[a] ‘telecommunications services provider’ offers retail telecommunications services.” Opinion, ¶ 36 (citing § 15–53–129(14), MCA). Because Bresnan holds some two-way telephony and internet property, it operates, in part, as a telecommunications company. However, the Court gets sidetracked by then deducing that § 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA, allows the Department to classify nearly all of Bresnan's property under class thirteen, Opinion, ¶ 40, when in reality, only some of that property—a very small fraction of it—actually facilitates the two-way transmission of voice, image, and data.¶ 65 The statute does not require that all property of a telecommunications services company is to be taxed under class thirteen. By allowing the Department to tax Bresnan's one-way property under class thirteen, the Court disregards the basic premise of our property classification system—different types of property are taxed in different classes. N. Pac. Ry. v. Sanders Co., 66 Mont. 608, 615–16, 214 P. 596, 599 (1923) (determining “[c]lassification must be based upon substantial distinctions which make one class really different from another.”); see § 15–6–101(2), MCA. The Legislature made a conscious decision to tax cable television systems at a 3% rate under class eight, § 15–6–138(1)(k), MCA, and telecommunications services property at a 6% rate under class thirteen, § 15–6–156(1)(d), MCA. We should not permit the Department to ignore this distinction.2 Consistent with the classification system as a whole and the duty to construe the statutes in favor of the taxpayer, only property that actually meets the definition of telecommunications services property should be so classified. Thus, the statutes require an apportionment of taxes between Bresnan's two-way transmission property—which demarcates a telecommunications services company in the first place—and its predominately one-way cable television property.¶ 66 The Court's determination that the “legislature intended to include all other property that a telecommunications services provider owns in class thirteen,” Opinion, ¶ 41, does great harm to not only Bresnan, but potentially to the property tax system as a whole. This holding runs directly counter to the property classification structure and to the manner in which telecommunications companies—and other companies—are actually taxed. For example, class nine property includes “allocations for centrally assessed natural gas distribution utilities․” Section 15–6–141(1)(d), MCA. Under the Court's analysis, this language would necessarily incorporate all properties of natural gas distribution utilities into this class and tax them at a 12% rate, see § 15–6–141(2). Clearly, this is not the case, as other utility property, such as “air and water pollution control equipment,” is classified under class five and taxed at a rate of 3%. See § 15–6–135(1)(b), (5).¶ 67 Moreover, the Court fails to apply our use and productivity test with any precision. During oral argument, Bresnan analogized its property to a superhighway consisting of 800 lanes. 796 of these lanes are filled bumper-to-bumper with trucks travelling one way, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The remaining 4 lanes contain cars travelling two ways. These cars do not move all the time, only sporadically. The trucks in this analogy represent Bresnan's one-way cable television property. The cars represent Bresnan's two-way telecommunications services property. Accordingly, after making extensive findings, the District Court determined that the overwhelming use of Bresnan's property is one-way transmission that receives and amplifies television broadcast signals. The Court's wholesale reliance on the Department's audit does not render these findings clearly erroneous—M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6) requires that we “give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the witnesses' credibility .” Both parties' experts testified that Bresnan operates a cable television system. Class eight property includes “cable television systems,” § 15–6–138(1)(k), MCA, which by definition “receive[ ] and amplif [y] the signals broadcast by one or more television stations.” Section 35–18–102, MCA.¶ 68 The Court sidesteps the hard work of analyzing the record evidence, declining “to parse the number and type of electrical data signals that Bresnan transmits over its network or the allocations of the network's physical elements․” Opinion, ¶ 40. However, nothing could be more indicative of a network's use than the number and type of data signals actually being transmitted over it. In sum, the Court claims to be classifying property on the basis of use, Opinion ¶¶ 31, 34, 40, but ultimately fails to do so by allowing the Department to place nearly all of Bresnan's property into class thirteen.¶ 69 Bresnan has been changing the services it provides from cable television to telecommunications services. Consistent therewith, Bresnan has been reporting those changes, listing properties that are utilized for telecommunications services under class thirteen. However, the Department of Revenue got up one morning and decided to flip the entire company into class thirteen, thereby increasing Bresnan's taxes by an incredible 329% overnight, from $1.7 million to $7.3 million, even though the overwhelmingly predominant use of Bresnan's property is for class eight purposes. This disincentive for companies to expand their telecommunications services was not created or intended by the Legislature, but is the work of the Department. It should be called highway robbery-perhaps the first case of information superhighway robbery by the tax authorities.¶ 70 I dissent.FOOTNOTES1.  “Analog electronic communication long has been measured in “bandwidth” in units of MegaHertz (“MHz”). The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) historically defined a “channel” as six (6) MHz.”2.  The Court argues that by classifying nearly all of Bresnan's property under class thirteen, the Department is simply addressing “an administrative matter within its broad discretion.” Opinion, ¶ 43. However, we have also held that an agency's implementation of a statute must be “consistent and not in conflict with the statute” and must “effectuate the purpose of the statute.” Mont. Trout Unlimited v. Mont. Dept. of Nat. Resources and Conserv., 2006 MT 72, ¶ 36, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224 (citation omitted) (discussing an agency's rulemaking authority).Justice BRIAN MORRIS delivered the Opinion of the Court.
We concur: MIKE McGRATH, PATRICIA COTTER, MICHAEL E. WHEAT and BETH BAKER.

Bresnan Communications, LLC v State of Montana, Department of Revenue

Case No. DA 12-0569 (MT S.Ct., Dec. 2, 2013)


		  		    The State of Montana Department of Revenue (Department) appeals the order of the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, that determined that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive assessments on Bresnan Communications, LLC (Bresnan). The Department also appeals the separate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order that determined that Bresnan owns exclusively class eight cable television system properties under § 15-6-138(l)(k), MCA. We reverse and remand.   

We address the following issues on appeal:   

1. Whether the District Court properly determined that Bresnan owned exclusively class eight property?   

2. Whether the District Court properly concluded that the Department lacked authority to impose retroactive property tax assessments? 

PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND 

Bresnan challenged the Department’s decision to tax Bresnan as a single entity rather than allowing Bresnan to apportion unilaterally its assets among tax classifications. Bresnan is a Delaware Limited Liability Company that operates in Montana. Bresnan purchased the cable television network infrastructure in Montana that is at the center of this dispute in 2003.   

Bresnan’s 2003 network was typical of cable systems. The “headend” of that network received and broadcasted data that Bresnan chose. The headend broadcasted data over the “trunk cable,” the industry name for the networked cable system that connected Bresnan’s data feed to each customer’s neighborhood. Once the data reached a customer’s neighborhood, the “feeder cable” transmitted data throughout the neighborhood. Each individual customer had a “drop cable” that connected the feeder cable to the customer’s home. The drop cable connected to the customer’s “terminal equipment.” The terminal equipment, commonly known as the set-top box, interpreted which data to play on a television.

notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Objection is resolved in
accordance with this Section 2.4 and GAAP would require
any changes to any other components of the Post-Closing Adjustment
Notice as a result of such resolution, then such required changes
shall be made to such other components as part of the resolution of
such Objection.
 

(b)    If
Seller and Acquiror are unable to resolve all of the Objections
within such thirty (30) day period, either Seller or Acquiror
may refer any remaining Objections that
 


 

have not been resolved
by such date to the CPA Firm, which, acting as experts and not as
arbitrators, shall make its determination as to the resolution of
such remaining Objections. Acquiror and Seller shall instruct the
CPA Firm to deliver its written determination to Acquiror and
Seller no later than thirty (30) days after their submission
to it of such remaining Objections. The CPA Firm's determination
with respect to the remaining Objections shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties. The fees and disbursements of the CPA
Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and Acquiror. Seller and
Acquiror shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all relevant

Seller pursuant to Section 2.2 .
 

(d)    Promptly
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after all
aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall have become
conclusive and binding on the parties pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, (i) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative
number, Acquiror will pay the absolute value thereof to BBHI
Holdings by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Seller and (ii) if the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Seller
will cause BBHI Holdings to pay the value thereof to Acquiror by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Acquiror.
 
Section 2.5    
Withholding Rights . Acquiror will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as Acquiror is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, and pay such withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing
authority. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld
by Acquiror, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

warrants to Acquiror as follows:

 
Section 3.1    
Organization and Qualification; Equity Interests
.

 

(a)    Each of
Seller, BBHI Holdings, the Company, Bresnan Communications, Bresnan
Microwave and Bresnan Digital is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Bresnan of Colorado is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Colorado. Bresnan of Montana is a limited

Wyoming. Each of BBHI Holdings, the Company and each Subsidiary has
all requisite limited liability company power and authority to own,
lease and operate its respective assets and to carry on the
Business as currently conducted. Each of BBHI Holdings, the Company
and each Subsidiary is duly
 


 

qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign limited liability
company in each jurisdiction, if any, where the ownership or
operation of its assets or its respective conduct of the Business
requires such qualification, except for failures to be so qualified
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b)    Other
than the Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, of record or beneficially, any outstanding Equity
Interest in any Person or have the right or obligation to acquire
any Equity Interest or other interest in any Person. The Company
and its Subsidiaries own and have good and valid title to all of
the Equity Interests of each Subsidiary, free and clear of all
Encumbrances.
 

(c)    The
Membership Interests constitute all of the issued and outstanding
Equity Interests in the Company. BBHI Holdings is the sole record
owner of, and has good and valid title to, all of the issued and
outstanding Membership Interests, and Seller is the sole record
owner of, and has good and valid title to, all of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company membership interests of BBHI
Holdings, in each case free and clear of any Encumbrance. Neither
Seller nor BBHI Holdings is a party to any Contract (other than
this Agreement and the LLC Agreement) that could, directly or
indirectly, restrict the transfer of, or otherwise restrict the
dividend rights, sale or other disposition of, or subject to any
Encumbrance, the Membership Interests. Neither Seller nor BBHI
Holdings is a party to any voting trust, proxy or other agreement
or understanding (other than this Agreement and the LLC Agreement)

Equity Interest in the Company. Assuming Acquiror has the requisite
power and authority to be the lawful owner of the Membership
Interests, upon the sale and delivery of the Membership Interests
as provided in this Agreement, Acquiror will acquire good and valid
title to such Membership Interests, in each case free and clear of
all Encumbrances and free of any limitation or restriction on the
right to vote the Membership Interests, in each case, other than
those arising from Acquiror's ownership or actions. All of the
issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the Company and each of
the Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable, no Equity Interests of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries are reserved for issuance and,
as of the Closing Date, there will be no dividends or distributions
with respect to any Equity Interests of the Company that have been
declared but not paid. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor
any of their Affiliates has granted any outstanding securities,
options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or
any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Subsidiary
is bound obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue, deliver
or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any additional
Equity Interests, or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking.

under such Related Agreements. BBHI Holdings has full limited
liability company power and authority to perform the actions that

the Subsidiaries with, any Person in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement, other than

the Subsidiaries under, or result in a loss of any material benefit
to which the Company or a Subsidiary is entitled under, any

Monthly System Profit Statements have been prepared from the system
of accounting and internal controls of the Company and the
Subsidiaries that were used to prepare the Audited Financial

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Prior to

any of the Subsidiaries, except for any such breaches or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a
 


 

Material Adverse
Effect. True, correct and complete copies of all Material Contracts

the Company and each Subsidiary (i) that owns a fee interest
in a parcel of Owned Real Property has good and marketable title
thereto, and (ii) that leases Leased Real Property pursuant to
a Lease has a valid leasehold interest therein (subject to
expiration of such Lease in accordance with its terms), except to
the extent that the failure to have any such valid leasehold
interest would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and in the case of each of clauses (i) or (ii)
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

 

(d)    To the
Company's Knowledge, the ownership, occupancy, use and operation of

to occupy any of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property
pursuant to Demising Leases. There are no outstanding agreements,

zoning classification, variance, special use, or other applicable
land use law of any portion of the Owned Real Property or, to the
Company's Knowledge, the Leased Real Property, except to the extent
such proceedings would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.
 

(g)As of the date of
this Agreement, none of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real
Property has suffered any material damage by fire or other casualty
that has not been or will not prior to the Closing have been
repaired and restored in all material respects, except for damage
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair
the use of such property in the conduct of the Business.

 
Section
3.13     Tangible Personal Property;
Sufficiency of Assets . All material items of Fixtures and
Equipment are, in the aggregate (and with due consideration for
reasonable wear and tear and the age of each specific item of
Fixtures and Equipment), in sufficient operating condition and
repair for their respective present uses and operation. Each of the
Company and each Subsidiary (i) that owns any material item of
Fixtures and Equipment has good and valid title thereto and
(ii) that leases any material item of Fixtures and Equipment
has a valid leasehold interest therein (subject to expiration of
any applicable Contract in accordance with its terms), except to
the extent that the failure to have any such valid leasehold
interest would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii),
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances. At the Closing and taking into account the rights of
the Company and the Subsidiaries under the Transition Services
Agreement, the Company and the Subsidiaries will own, or have a
valid legal right to use, sufficient property, assets and other
rights (whether tangible or intangible) to be able to lawfully
operate and conduct the Business and the operations of the Company

currently conducted, in each case except for any intellectual
property not owned by the Company and the Subsidiaries and the
assets, employees and services set forth in
Section 3.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Each of
the Company and each Subsidiary owns inventory, plant replacement
materials and customer premises equipment at levels (by device
type) consistent with the Company's and the Subsidiaries' past
practice in the Ordinary Course and, with respect to customer
premises equipment only, of a quantity (by device type) sufficient
to enable Acquiror to conduct the Business, as it is conducted by
Seller as of the date of this Agreement, for at least a 30-day
period following the Closing Date.

plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, and

stock appreciation rights, stock based, incentive and bonus plans
(the “ Benefit Plans ”) as of the date of this
Agreement are listed on Section 3.14(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans
of the Company, the Subsidiaries, and ERISA Affiliates, including,
but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance contracts and,

forming a part of any Benefit Plans, and all amendments thereto,
(or, if unwritten, a written description of such Benefit Plan) have
been made available to Acquiror.
 

(b)    None of

meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, the Company, the
Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates have not contributed to a
multiemployer plan within the past six years, and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates have not incurred and do
not expect to incur any withdrawal liability under Subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA.
 

(c)    Each of
the Benefit Plans is in material compliance with ERISA (where
applicable), the Code and other applicable laws. Each Benefit Plan
which is subject to ERISA (an “ ERISA Plan ”)
that is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a “ Pension
Plan ”) intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and the
Company, the Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates are not aware
of any circumstances likely to result in the loss of the
qualification of any such plan under Section 401(a) of the
Code. Each trust in which such Pension Plan assets are held is
exempt from tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code.
 

(d)    Nothing
done or omitted to be done and no transaction or holding of any
asset under or in connection with any Benefit Plan has made or will
make the Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, or any
officer or director of the Company, the Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate, subject to any Liability under Title I or ERISA or any
Liability for any tax under Section 4972 or Sections 4975 through
4980G, inclusive.
 

(e)    None of
the Benefit Plans is a “single-employer plan”, within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, and no liability
Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by
the Company, the Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates.
 

(f)    All
contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan have been
timely made and all obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan
have been properly accrued and reflected in the financial
statements of the Company, the Subsidiaries or their ERISA
Affiliates.
 

(g)    Under
each Benefit Plan where relevant, as of the last day of the most
recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the present value
of all benefit liabilities did not
 


 

exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Benefit Plan, and there has been no
material change in the financial condition of the Benefit Plan
since the last day of the most recent plan year. The Company, the
Subsidiaries and its ERISA Affiliates have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any such Benefit Plan.

 

(h)No Benefit Plan is
maintained in connection with any trust described in Code Section
501(c)(9).

 

(i)The Company, the
Subsidiaries, and their ERISA Affiliates have no obligations for
post-retirement health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan (or
under any other agreement), except as may be required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended.

 

(j)To the Knowledge of
the Company, there have been no prohibited transactions with
respect to any Benefit Plan. No fiduciary (as defined in Section
3(21) of ERISA) has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or
any other failure to act or comply in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any such Benefit
Plan. No action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation with
respect to the administration

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the Unit
Holders. The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared
equally by the Unit Holders, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on
the other hand, and, in the case of the Unit Holders, shall be
payable from the Adjustment Escrow Fund. The Unit Holders’

aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount shall have become
conclusive and binding on the parties pursuant to the foregoing
provisions, (i) if the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, Acquiror will pay the absolute value thereof to
the Unit Holders’ Representative by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
the Unit Holders’ Representative and (ii) if the
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Acquiror
and the Unit Holders’ Representative shall provide joint
written instructions to the Adjustment Escrow Agent to
(A) distribute to Acquiror from the Adjustment Escrow Fund
cash equal to the lesser of (x) such Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and (B) if such
positive Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, to distribute the balance of the Adjustment Fund
Escrow to the Unit Holders’ Representative in accordance with
the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement for distribution to
the Unit Holders in accordance with the Unit Holders’
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if a positive
Post-Closing Adjustment Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Fund,
the amount thereof shall be payable only from the Adjustment Escrow
Fund and there shall be no positive Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
in excess of the Adjustment Escrow Fund.


     Section 2.6
Withholding Rights . Acquiror or the Surviving Entity will
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
Acquiror or the Surviving Entity is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and pay such
withholding amount over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Acquiror or the

purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Company has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of all
Demising Leases.

27



 


          (c) Each
of the Company and each Subsidiary (i) that owns a fee
interest in a parcel of Owned Real Property has good and marketable
title thereto, and (ii) that leases Leased Real Property
pursuant to a Lease has a valid leasehold interest therein (subject
to expiration of such Lease in accordance with its terms), except
to the extent that the failure to have any such valid leasehold
interest would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and in the case of each of clauses (i) or
(ii) free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances.


          (d) To
the Company’s Knowledge, the ownership, occupancy, use and

variance, special use, or other applicable land use law of any
portion of the Owned Real Property or, to the Company’s
Knowledge, the Leased Real Property, except to the extent such
proceedings would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.


          (g) As
of the date of this Agreement, none of the Owned Real Property or
the Leased Real Property has suffered any material damage by fire
or other casualty that has not been or will not prior to the
Closing have been repaired and restored in all material respects,
except for damage that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair the use of such property in the conduct of the
Business.


     Section 3.13
Tangible Personal Property; Sufficiency of Assets . All
material items of Fixtures and Equipment are, in the aggregate (and
with due consideration for reasonable wear and tear and the age of
each specific item of Fixtures or Equipment), in sufficient
operating condition and repair. Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary (i) that owns any material item of Fixtures and
Equipment has good and valid title thereto and (ii) that
leases any material item of Fixtures and Equipment has a valid
leasehold interest therein (subject to expiration of any applicable
Contract in accordance with its terms), except to the extent that
the failure to have any such valid leasehold interest would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and in
the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), free and clear of
all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. At the Closing,
the Company and the Subsidiaries will own, or have a valid legal
right to use, sufficient property, assets and other rights (whether
tangible or

28

as it is currently conducted.


     Section 3.14

based, incentive and bonus plans (the “ Benefit Plans
”) are listed on Section 3.14(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans,
including, but not limited to, any trust instruments, insurance
contracts and, with respect to any employee stock ownership plan,
loan agreements forming a part of any Benefit Plans, and all

Subsidiaries have not contributed to a multiemployer plan within
the past six years, and the Company and the Subsidiaries have not
incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.


          (c) Each
of the Benefit Plans are in material compliance with ERISA (where
applicable), the Code and other applicable laws. Each Benefit Plan
which is subject to ERISA (an “ ERISA Plan ”)
that is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a “ Pension
Plan ”) intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result in the loss of the qualification of
any such Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.


          (d) None

within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, and no

contributions required to be made under each Benefit Plan, as of
the date hereof, have been timely made and all obligations in
respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected in the financial statements of the Company.

each Benefit Plan where relevant, as of the last day of the most
recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the present value
of all benefit liabilities did not exceed the then current value of
the assets of such Benefit Plan, and there has been no material
change in the financial condition of the Benefit Plan since the
last day of the most recent plan year. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to
any such Benefit Plan.


          (g) Neither
the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has any obligations for
post-retirement health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan (or
under any other agreement),

29



 


except as may
be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended.


          (h) There
has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially
the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense
incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. No complete or
partial termination or modification of any Benefit Plan has
occurred or is expected to occur


          (i) Except
as set forth in Section 3.14(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither the execution of this Agreement,
approval of this Agreement by the Company’s members or
Manager nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (i) entitle any employees of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance pay
upon any termination of employment after the date hereof,
(ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in
any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Benefit Plans, (iii) limit or restrict the right of the
Company or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, Acquiror to merge, amend or terminate any of the Benefit
Plans or (iv) result in payments under any of the Benefit
Plans which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) or
Section 280G of the Code.


          (j) The
Company has classified all individuals who perform services for
them correctly under each employee benefit plan, ERISA, the Code
and other applicable law as common law employees, independent
contractors or leased employees.


     Section 3.15
Labor Relations . Except as described in
Section 3.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of
the date hereof, there is no collective bargaining or other labor
union agreement applicable to any of the Employees, and no
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company
or the Subsidiaries with respect to any of the Employees. As of the
date hereof, to the Company’s Knowledge, there is no effort
by or on behalf of any labor union to organize any Employees. As of
the date hereof, there is no labor dispute or strike pending
against the Company or the Subsidiaries that would reasonably be

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.
