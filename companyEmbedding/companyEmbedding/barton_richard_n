Richard N. Barton,  (born June 2, 1967, New Canaan, Conn., U.S.), American creator of the do-it-yourself Web sites Expedia.com and Zillow.com.Barton graduated from Stanford University in 1989 with a degree in industrial design. In 1991 he joined Microsoft, Inc., where he served as a product manager for MS-DOS and, later, the Windows operating system. While working on a Microsoft travel-guide project, Barton was inspired to provide consumers with direct access to flight information rather than leave them dependent on airlines and travel agencies, which effectively monopolized the travel-booking business. Microsoft launched Barton’s idea as Expedia.com in 1994. It was spun off as a public company in 1999, and under Barton’s guidance Expedia became one of the most popular—and financially successful—travel-booking Web sites. He remained the firm’s president and CEO until 2003.In 2006 Barton and Lloyd Frink, a former Expedia executive, created Zillow.com, a self-service real estate Web site that looked to duplicate the success of Expedia. Zillow was instantly popular, due in large part to a feature called the Zestimate, which provided users with an estimated value for any of the tens of millions of homes in the site’s database. Among Barton’s other popular ventures was Glassdoor, a Web site he cofounded in 2007. It allowed past and present employees to post anonymous reviews of their companies.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Nolan's cinematic vision in 'Dunkirk' is Hollywood's best defense against Netflix
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    11:00 AM ET 07/23/2017
                                                


Christopher Nolan-helmed' Dunkirk,' filmed using 65 mm Imax cameras, is meant to feel like virtual reality minus the headset.

                                                    African Markets - Factors to watch on July 21
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    2:28 AM ET 07/21/2017
                                                


The following company announcements, scheduled economic indicators, debt and currency market moves and political events may affect African markets on Friday.

















                                                    Netflix needs to address new accounting standards if it continues licensing content

New standards focus mainly on revenue from contracts with customers. If Netflix Inc. (NFLX) continues to explore the lucrative opportunities offered by its original content, the company is going to have to make changes to how it identifies and records revenue. That's because of a new rule issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 2014, that changes standards for how companies recognize revenue.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Barton, Richard N.

▪ 2007

      On Feb. 7, 2006, Richard Barton, creator of the do-it-yourself travel Web site Expedia.com, unveiled his newest brainchild, Zillow.com, a national real-estate information Web site that made it possible for anyone with Internet access to look up the value of a friend's—or a celebrity's—house. Zillow.com displayed the transaction history, property description, square footage, and other details on tens of millions of homes in the U.S. Unlike competing sites that charged for access or required registering with a real-estate agent, however, Zillow provided the information with no strings attached—other than viewing Web page advertisements.

      Barton was born on June 2, 1967. As a youth in New Canaan, Conn., he spent summers selling frozen treats on an ice-cream truck route and caddying at a country club. In the summers between academic years at Stanford University, where he studied industrial engineering (B.S., 1989), Barton ran his own house-painting company. He joined Microsoft, Inc., in 1991and served as a product manager for MS-DOS and, later, the Windows operating system. While working on a Microsoft travel-guide project, Barton was inspired to provide consumers with direct access to flight information rather than leave them dependent on airlines and travel agencies, which effectively monopolized the travel-booking business. Microsoft launched Barton's idea as Expedia.com in 1994. It was spun off as a public company in 1999, and under Barton's guidance Expedia became one of the most popular—and financially successful—travel-booking Web sites. He remained as the firm's president and CEO until March 2003, when he left to travel abroad and spend time with his family. He founded Zillow, Inc. (incorporated in 2004) with Lloyd Frink, a former Expedia executive.

      Barton drew parallels between Expedia and Zillow, both of which were designed to put information directly in the hands of customers. The model for Zillow, however, had limits. The company, which was based in Seattle, prioritized its coverage of West Coast cities with data for other parts of the country far less complete. Unlike Expedia, there was no transaction, such as a ticket sale, on which to earn a commission; Zillow's main source of revenue was expected to come from ads. Furthermore, real estate is difficult to commodify. Accordingly, Zillow provided such services as “Zindex,” a value index with which to compare a home's historic value with similar homes in the area, and “Zestimate,” a sophisticated price estimate calculated by running public data through Zillow's proprietary algorithm. Barton initially released Zillow as a beta (introductory version) with the idea of refining the site in the ensuing months. If Zillow's ability to make money on ad clicks remained an open question, it was nonetheless likely that Barton's latest creation would put pressure on real-estate agents to lower their commissions, since Zillow provided a good deal of realtors' research for free.

      Barton graduated from Stanford University in 1989 with a degree in industrial design. In 1991 he joined Microsoft, Inc. (Microsoft Corporation), where he served as a product manager for MS-DOS and, later, the Windows operating system.

It was spun off as a public company in 1999, and under Barton's guidance Expedia became one of the most popular—and financially successful—travel-booking Web sites. He remained the firm's president and CEO until 2003. Three years later Barton and Lloyd Frink, a former Expedia executive, created Zillow.com, a self-service real estate Web site that looked to duplicate the success of Expedia. Zillow was instantly popular, due in large part to a feature called the Zestimate, which provided users with an estimated value for any of the tens of millions of homes in the site's database.
