Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. announced that safety and efficacy data from its previously completed Phase 2 clinical study of anabasum (formerly known as JBT-101) for the treatment of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis was presented earlier today at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Annual Meeting in Madrid, Spain. The presentation included a review of the Phase 2 topline data previously announced, additional data from the study regarding Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29, and additional analysis of the previously-reported CRISS domains and transcriptome data. Anabasum was granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track status for the treatment of systemic sclerosis from the FDA in 2015 and Orphan Designation from the EMA in January 2017. Corbus also has an ongoing 12-month, open-label extension to its Phase 2 clinical study of anabasum for systemic sclerosis and expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, Corbus announced its plans to commence a Phase 3 study of anabasum for the treatment of systemic sclerosis in the fourth quarter of 2017. The international Phase 3 trial will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in approximately 270 adults with systemic sclerosis. Subjects will be randomized to receive anabasum 20 mg twice per day, anabasum 5 mg twice per day, or placebo twice per day. Corbus expects to complete enrollment of this 52-week study in 2018 and expects to conclude the study by the end of 2019.

Business Description


Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, chronic, and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.
The Company's lead product candidate, anabasum (aka JBT-101 or Resunab), is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug designed to resolve chronic inflammation and fibrotic processes. Anabasum has demonstrated positive results in two Phase 2 studies, one in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and one in cystic fibrosis. Additionally, anabasum is being evaluated in a 12-month open-label extension study in systemic sclerosis, a Phase 2 study in skin-predominant dermatomyositis with a 12-month open-label extension, and soon in another Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus.
Corbus plans to commence a Phase 3 study to support a New Drug Application (NDA) of anabasum for the treatment of systemic sclerosis in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company is also planning to initiate a second larger and longer Phase 2b study of anabasum for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Corbus Pharmaceuticals Announces Completion of Phase 2 Study of JBT-101 (Resunab) for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis
Topline data on track to be reported in Q1 2017
NORWOOD, MA -- (Marketwired) -- 12/29/16 -- 
        Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CRBP) ("Corbus" or the "Company"), a clinical stage drug development company targeting rare, chronic, serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, announced today that it has completed its Phase 2 study evaluating JBT-101 ("Resunab") for the treatment of cystic fibrosis ("CF"). JBT-101, the Company's novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug, is designed to resolve chronic inflammation and halt fibrosis. Corbus expects to report topline data from this study in the first quarter of 2017.

"We are pleased to announce the on-schedule completion of our Phase 2 trial evaluating JBT-101 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the individuals, their clinicians and the clinical staff who participated in this trial," stated Yuval Cohen, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of the Company. 
The international, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is supported by a $5 million Development Award from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. The primary objective of the study was to test safety and tolerability of JBT-101 in adults with CF who had forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) percent predicted at least 40%, without regard to their CFTR mutation, infecting pathogen, or baseline treatment. Secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators as a marker of mechanism of action of JBT-101 and to evaluate efficacy with FEV1 and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised -- Respiratory Symptom Score. Exploratory outcomes included effects of JBT-101 on biomarkers of inflammation and the sputum microbiome. Eighty-five subjects on stable standard-of-care medications were dosed with study product at 21 CF centers in the U.S. and Europe and treated with study product daily for a period of 84 days, with a follow-up period of 28 days. 
"We look forward to having our first safety data on JBT-101 in CF. Because excessive inflammation is a key driver of airway obstruction and lung damage over time in CF, resolving inflammation has the potential to provide significant clinical benefit to CF patients, importantly without immunosuppression," said Barbara White, MD, Chief Medical Officer of the Company. "We believe that showing that JBT-101 has an acceptable safety profile in CF is a gate-keeping event for its further clinical development in CF, and we anticipate announcing top-line results before the end of the first quarter of 2017."
JBT-101 was granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track status for the treatment of CF from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in 2015 and was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Union for the treatment of CF in October 2016. The Company recently reported positive topline data results from its Phase 2 study in diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis ("systemic sclerosis"), showing clear signal of clinical benefit with JBT-101. Additionally, JBT-101 is being evaluated in a Phase 2, 12-month open label extension study in systemic sclerosis, a Phase 2 study in skin-predominant dermatomyositis, with a 12-month open label extension study in dermatomyositis and a another Phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE") planned to commence in the first quarter of 2017. 
For more information on the Phase 2 study for the treatment of CF, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov and reference Identifier NCT02465450.

About Cystic Fibrosis 

Cystic Fibrosis ("CF") is a chronic, life-threatening, genetic disease caused by inheriting two dysfunctional CFTR genes that normally regulate salt and water movement across cells in the respiratory and digestive systems. CF affects approximately 30,000 patients in the U.S and 75,000 patients worldwide. People with CF have thick, sticky mucus that clogs their airways, with recurrent bacterial infections and chronic inflammation in their lungs. In the gastrointestinal tract, they also have mucus accumulation, bacterial overgrowth, and inflammation. The dysfunctional CFTR genes cause an exaggerated inflammatory response that compounds the damage from a coexisting infection in the lungs and gut. CF results in destruction of lung tissue, lung fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, CF-related diabetes, malabsorption, malnutrition, growth retardation, and liver disease, including cirrhosis. The harmful inflammation and accompanying fibrosis in CF damages multiple organs, impairs organ function, reduces health-related quality of life, and can lead to death.

About JBT-101 (Resunab)JBT-101 is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug that preferentially binds to the CB2 receptor expressed on activated immune cells and fibroblasts. CB2 activation triggers endogenous pathways that resolve inflammation and halt fibrosis. Preclinical and Phase 1 studies have shown JBT-101 to have a favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. It has also demonstrated promising potency in preclinical models of inflammation and fibrosis. JBT-101 is designed to trigger the production of "Specialized Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators" that activate an endogenous cascade responsible for the resolution of inflammation and fibrosis, while reducing production of multiple inflammatory mediators. JBT-101 has direct effects on fibroblasts to halt tissue scarring. In effect, JBT-101 triggers endogenous pathways to turn "off" chronic inflammation and fibrotic processes, without causing immunosuppression.

About CorbusCorbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat rare, chronic, and serious inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Our lead product candidate, JBT-101, is a novel synthetic oral endocannabinoid-mimetic drug designed to resolve chronic inflammation, and fibrotic processes. JBT-101 is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and skin-predominant dermatomyositis, with a fourth Phase 2 trial in systemic lupus erythematosus planned to commence during the first half of 2017.

Overview
Inflammation is an attempt for the body to protect itself as part of a complex biological response of vascular tissue to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells or irritants. Just as the immune system can be triggered to elicit inflammation, it can also be triggered to "resolve" or turn off inflammation. This "off" switch for inflammation was discovered relatively recently, resulting from the production of anti-inflammatory cellular mediators such as resolvins and lipoxins. Many chronic inflammatory diseases result from an imbalance between the "on" and "off" signals resulting in heightened inflammation that is unable to resolve.
One of the triggers for this process is the CB2 receptor pathway found in lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, glial cells and other immune cells. Upon activation of the CB2 receptor on immune cells there is a shift in eicosanoid production, resulting in a reduction in pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (e.g. PGE2 and LTB4) and an increase in specialized pro-resolving mediator eicosanoids (e.g. PGJ2 and LXA4). The end result is that inflammation is halted and resolved while the damaged tissue is remodeled and healed.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.
