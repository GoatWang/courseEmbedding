Our Culture Sets Us Apart

      It's the culture of a company that allows it to flourish for over 45 years. ERA King Real Estate was founded in 1969 by Jack King and we have never wavered from his vision of "Just Do The Right Thing". In the 45  years ERA King, the company, has never sold a property, our people do. Therefore, ERA King has been able to outperform the markets by being the very best agent support service ever. While other companies were hanging on or disappearing during the recent recession, we actually grew. How? It's our culture.

Our Culture Sets Us Apart

      It's the culture of a company that allows it to flourish for over 45 years. ERA King Real Estate was founded in 1969 by Jack King and we have never wavered from his vision of "Just Do The Right Thing". In the 45  years ERA King, the company, has never sold a property, our people do. Therefore, ERA King has been able to outperform the markets by being the very best agent support service ever. While other companies were hanging on or disappearing during the recent recession, we actually grew. How? It's our culture.
