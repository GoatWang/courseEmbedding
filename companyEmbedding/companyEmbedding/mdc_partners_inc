Why is MDC Partners different from other ad holding companies?
MDC Partners is more than a marketing organization. We are a Business Transformation Organization that utilizes technology, marketing communications, data analytics and strategic consulting solutions to drive meaningful returns on Marketing and Communications Investments for clients around the world.
We have long held a distinct view of the industry, and have benefitted from our entrepreneurial culture. Our reputation as “The Place Where Great Talent Lives,” is rooted in our durable competitive advantage of empowering the most talented entrepreneurial thought leaders to drive business success to new levels of achievement, for our clients and our shareholders – that prefers the perspective of the insurgent.
This commitment to great talent comes to life in the structural organization of MDC because we believe that these influential, innovative people – the type of people that create the most value for organizations – thrive in an atypical environment.  Accordingly, MDC generally establishes perpetual partnership with agency partners by initially acquiring 51-75% of firms, and putting in place equity-linked ownership mechanisms for the next-generation management team, thereby leaving a significant equity stake in the hands of the operating leadership.  In addition, at the corporate level, we enlist world-class executives with specialized expertise to support the ambitions and unique needs of our partners and clients.
MDC’s cultural and structural difference has enabled us to successfully create a billion dollar revenue platform with an infrastructure built for growth, extraordinary thought leadership talent across our partner companies, a global perspective, and cutting edge marketing solutions that are social, analytically based, insight-driven and most importantly, drive significant financial results for our clients.  Organic growth has long served as one of the strongest indicators that we are successfully partnering with clients to drive financial and operational results for them, and we are proud that our organic growth has far outpaced and outperformed that of the industry over the last seven years.

What value does MDC bring to the agencies in its network?
MDC Partners’ main focus is to provide our partner firms whatever resources they need to best service their respective clients and grow. We do this by not only leveraging best practices and our capital, but also by enlisting world-class practice-area experts as part of our Strategic Resources Group.  This group of executives actively works with our partner firms in areas such as new business development and cross-pollination of client relationships, overall strategy, digital strategy, analytics, talent development, retention and recruitment, procurement, operational best practices and public relations.

How many agencies are in the network?
MDC Partners is a global network of over 50 agency brands.

What is MDC's client concentration?
Our top top 10 clients are 22.0% of Q1 2017 revenue.

In what industries does MDC have the most client exposure?
As referenced in our first quarter management presentation see revenue by client sector below:


What are MDC’s plans for expansion internationally?
While MDC has historically largely been focused on North America, the largest market for our services in the world, our global footprint is becoming increasingly important as clients are looking to us to help them grow their businesses in new markets. Over the last several years, in fact, we have invested in multiple new overseas offices in order to leverage existing relationships with global clients. We now have over 20 offices in markets such as the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and more recently, India, which positions us well to increasingly win international and global assignments. Over 10% of MDC Partners’ revenues were generated outside of North America in 2016. Over time, based on client demand, we expect our overseas presence to increase as a percent of the total business.

GENERAL
These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company and govern your use of the Website, superseding any prior agreements between you and the Company. A printed version of the Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Your acceptance of the Terms of Use and use of the Website does not create a joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship between you and the Company.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website or the Terms of Use by you against the Company must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. You agree that all causes of action arising out of or connected with the Terms of Use shall be resolved individually without resort to any form of class action.
INTERNATIONAL USE
Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States and/or the country in which you reside. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

When this Privacy Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information" or "personal information" the Company means information that identifies a particular individual, such as your full name, street address, date of birth, and/or email address.
ACCEPTANCE / NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY 
By using the Website, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  The Company may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. If the Company makes a material change to the way in which the Company collects, uses, and/or shares your personal information, the Company will post a notice on the Website and / or send an email to users who have provided an email address. The Company will assume that you have given your permission for your information to be used under the terms of the Privacy Policy, as modified, if you do not respond to the Company email within thirty days or continue to use the Website thirty days after a notice is posted. Please note that you should always update your personal information to provide the Company with a current email address.

The Company also may keep track of what emails the Company sends you and what emails you may be receiving from the Company‚'s subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, the Company keeps a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.

Cookies
As with many websites, the Website uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a collection of information that gets stored on the hard drive of your computer when browsing the Internet. These small bits of code automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let the Company know how many people visit the Website and where visitors go on the Website. In addition, cookies can let the Company know non-personally identifiable information, like how many times a user has been on certain pages. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help the Company determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website.

Why is MDC Partners different from other ad holding companies?
MDC Partners is more than a marketing organization. We are a Business Transformation Organization that utilizes technology, marketing communications, data analytics and strategic consulting solutions to drive meaningful returns on Marketing and Communications Investments for clients around the world.
We have long held a distinct view of the industry, and have benefitted from our entrepreneurial culture. Our reputation as “The Place Where Great Talent Lives,” is rooted in our durable competitive advantage of empowering the most talented entrepreneurial thought leaders to drive business success to new levels of achievement, for our clients and our shareholders – that prefers the perspective of the insurgent.
This commitment to great talent comes to life in the structural organization of MDC because we believe that these influential, innovative people – the type of people that create the most value for organizations – thrive in an atypical environment.  Accordingly, MDC generally establishes perpetual partnership with agency partners by initially acquiring 51-75% of firms, and putting in place equity-linked ownership mechanisms for the next-generation management team, thereby leaving a significant equity stake in the hands of the operating leadership.  In addition, at the corporate level, we enlist world-class executives with specialized expertise to support the ambitions and unique needs of our partners and clients.
MDC’s cultural and structural difference has enabled us to successfully create a billion dollar revenue platform with an infrastructure built for growth, extraordinary thought leadership talent across our partner companies, a global perspective, and cutting edge marketing solutions that are social, analytically based, insight-driven and most importantly, drive significant financial results for our clients.  Organic growth has long served as one of the strongest indicators that we are successfully partnering with clients to drive financial and operational results for them, and we are proud that our organic growth has far outpaced and outperformed that of the industry over the last seven years.

What value does MDC bring to the agencies in its network?
MDC Partners’ main focus is to provide our partner firms whatever resources they need to best service their respective clients and grow. We do this by not only leveraging best practices and our capital, but also by enlisting world-class practice-area experts as part of our Strategic Resources Group.  This group of executives actively works with our partner firms in areas such as new business development and cross-pollination of client relationships, overall strategy, digital strategy, analytics, talent development, retention and recruitment, procurement, operational best practices and public relations.

How many agencies are in the network?
MDC Partners is a global network of over 50 agency brands.

What is MDC's client concentration?
Our top top 10 clients are 22.0% of Q1 2017 revenue.

In what industries does MDC have the most client exposure?
As referenced in our first quarter management presentation see revenue by client sector below:


What are MDC’s plans for expansion internationally?
While MDC has historically largely been focused on North America, the largest market for our services in the world, our global footprint is becoming increasingly important as clients are looking to us to help them grow their businesses in new markets. Over the last several years, in fact, we have invested in multiple new overseas offices in order to leverage existing relationships with global clients. We now have over 20 offices in markets such as the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and more recently, India, which positions us well to increasingly win international and global assignments. Over 10% of MDC Partners’ revenues were generated outside of North America in 2016. Over time, based on client demand, we expect our overseas presence to increase as a percent of the total business.

History[edit]
MDC Partners was founded as Multi Discipline Communications in 1980 in Toronto by Miles Nadal.[4][5] The company held an IPO on October 16, 1987.[6]
The company operated two divisions in the 1990s: Marketing and Communications and Secure Transaction Products, which included the production of checks, credit and debit cards, tickets, and stamps. Toward the end of the 1990s, MDC concentrated on growing its marketing and communications business. It continued to expand into the United States, surpassing CAD$1 billion in revenue in 2000 through acquisitions and organic growth.[7][6]
In 2001, MDC formed its first "partnership" with the agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky.[8]
In January 2004, the company changed its name to MDC Partners Inc.[9]
MDC became the first advertising company to build a capability designed for automated, or programmatic, media trading, with the formation of Varick Media Management, in 2008.[10]
The company acquired Anomaly in 2010 and 72andSunny in 2011.[11]
On July 21, 2015, Miles Nadal announced his resignation as CEO in response to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding executive pay and accounting practices. Nadal agreed to pay back $1.9 million in expenses and $10.6 million in salary and bonuses. He did not receive any severance or compensation for resigning. Chief accounting officer Michael Sabatino also announced his resignation and will reportedly repay $208,000 in bonuses.[12][12][13] MDC’s presiding director of the board, Scott Kauffman, succeeded Miles Nadal as Chairman and CEO.[14][15]
In December 2015, the company ranked 8th in Advertising Age’s global ranking of Agency Networks, by cumulative award wins.[16]In June 2016, MDC announced the first acquisition under Kauffman of Swedish creative agency Forsman & Bodenfors, forming a strategic partnership with sister agency CP+B.[17]
Operations[edit]
Company overview[edit]
MDC Partners is a global advertising holding company that invests in agency partners in the areas of advertising, marketing, media management, technology, analytics and consumer insights, direct marketing, and strategic consulting.[18][19] The company is headquartered in New York City and also operates a corporate office in Toronto, where it was initially founded.[20] It earned approximately US$1.33 billion in revenue 2015.[21]
MDC typically invests in creative and digital firms.[22][6] Historically, it invested in agencies during times when similar companies have scaled back on acquisitions.[11] While the company has mainly invested in North American small to mid-sized agencies,[22] it extended onto new global markets in the 2010s.[6] As of 2015, 9% of the company’s revenue came from outside North America.[23]
MDC does not generally acquire agencies outright, but instead most frequently partners with agency management by acquiring a 51 to 80 percent initial stake.[7] [6] Instead of integrating the firms, acquired agencies to continue to manage their own day-to-day operations.[24][6] MDC provides support to the agencies in which it has invested including business strategy and financial resources.[24] It operates a Strategic Resources Group, which supports the development of partner agencies.[25] [26][23] In 2004, Adweek called the company an "anti-holding company".[7]

History[edit]
MDC Partners was founded as Multi Discipline Communications in 1980 in Toronto by Miles Nadal.[4][5] The company held an IPO on October 16, 1987.[6]
The company operated two divisions in the 1990s: Marketing and Communications and Secure Transaction Products, which included the production of checks, credit and debit cards, tickets, and stamps. Toward the end of the 1990s, MDC concentrated on growing its marketing and communications business. It continued to expand into the United States, surpassing CAD$1 billion in revenue in 2000 through acquisitions and organic growth.[7][6]
In 2001, MDC formed its first "partnership" with the agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky.[8]
In January 2004, the company changed its name to MDC Partners Inc.[9]
MDC became the first advertising company to build a capability designed for automated, or programmatic, media trading, with the formation of Varick Media Management, in 2008.[10]
The company acquired Anomaly in 2010 and 72andSunny in 2011.[11]
On July 21, 2015, Miles Nadal announced his resignation as CEO in response to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding executive pay and accounting practices. Nadal agreed to pay back $1.9 million in expenses and $10.6 million in salary and bonuses. He did not receive any severance or compensation for resigning. Chief accounting officer Michael Sabatino also announced his resignation and will reportedly repay $208,000 in bonuses.[12][12][13] MDC’s presiding director of the board, Scott Kauffman, succeeded Miles Nadal as Chairman and CEO.[14][15]
In December 2015, the company ranked 8th in Advertising Age’s global ranking of Agency Networks, by cumulative award wins.[16]In June 2016, MDC announced the first acquisition under Kauffman of Swedish creative agency Forsman & Bodenfors, forming a strategic partnership with sister agency CP+B.[17]
Operations[edit]
Company overview[edit]
MDC Partners is a global advertising holding company that invests in agency partners in the areas of advertising, marketing, media management, technology, analytics and consumer insights, direct marketing, and strategic consulting.[18][19] The company is headquartered in New York City and also operates a corporate office in Toronto, where it was initially founded.[20] It earned approximately US$1.33 billion in revenue 2015.[21]
MDC typically invests in creative and digital firms.[22][6] Historically, it invested in agencies during times when similar companies have scaled back on acquisitions.[11] While the company has mainly invested in North American small to mid-sized agencies,[22] it extended onto new global markets in the 2010s.[6] As of 2015, 9% of the company’s revenue came from outside North America.[23]
MDC does not generally acquire agencies outright, but instead most frequently partners with agency management by acquiring a 51 to 80 percent initial stake.[7] [6] Instead of integrating the firms, acquired agencies to continue to manage their own day-to-day operations.[24][6] MDC provides support to the agencies in which it has invested including business strategy and financial resources.[24] It operates a Strategic Resources Group, which supports the development of partner agencies.[25] [26][23] In 2004, Adweek called the company an "anti-holding company".[7]

Major holdings include 52 advertising and marketing firms:[27][28]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Why is MDC Partners different from other ad holding companies?
MDC Partners is more than a marketing organization. We are a Business Transformation Organization that utilizes technology, marketing communications, data analytics and strategic consulting solutions to drive meaningful returns on Marketing and Communications Investments for clients around the world.
We have long held a distinct view of the industry, and have benefitted from our entrepreneurial culture. Our reputation as “The Place Where Great Talent Lives,” is rooted in our durable competitive advantage of empowering the most talented entrepreneurial thought leaders to drive business success to new levels of achievement, for our clients and our shareholders – that prefers the perspective of the insurgent.
This commitment to great talent comes to life in the structural organization of MDC because we believe that these influential, innovative people – the type of people that create the most value for organizations – thrive in an atypical environment.  Accordingly, MDC generally establishes perpetual partnership with agency partners by initially acquiring 51-75% of firms, and putting in place equity-linked ownership mechanisms for the next-generation management team, thereby leaving a significant equity stake in the hands of the operating leadership.  In addition, at the corporate level, we enlist world-class executives with specialized expertise to support the ambitions and unique needs of our partners and clients.
MDC’s cultural and structural difference has enabled us to successfully create a billion dollar revenue platform with an infrastructure built for growth, extraordinary thought leadership talent across our partner companies, a global perspective, and cutting edge marketing solutions that are social, analytically based, insight-driven and most importantly, drive significant financial results for our clients.  Organic growth has long served as one of the strongest indicators that we are successfully partnering with clients to drive financial and operational results for them, and we are proud that our organic growth has far outpaced and outperformed that of the industry over the last seven years.

What value does MDC bring to the agencies in its network?
MDC Partners’ main focus is to provide our partner firms whatever resources they need to best service their respective clients and grow. We do this by not only leveraging best practices and our capital, but also by enlisting world-class practice-area experts as part of our Strategic Resources Group.  This group of executives actively works with our partner firms in areas such as new business development and cross-pollination of client relationships, overall strategy, digital strategy, analytics, talent development, retention and recruitment, procurement, operational best practices and public relations.

How many agencies are in the network?
MDC Partners is a global network of over 50 agency brands.

What is MDC's client concentration?
Our top top 10 clients are 22.0% of Q1 2017 revenue.

In what industries does MDC have the most client exposure?
As referenced in our first quarter management presentation see revenue by client sector below:


What are MDC’s plans for expansion internationally?
While MDC has historically largely been focused on North America, the largest market for our services in the world, our global footprint is becoming increasingly important as clients are looking to us to help them grow their businesses in new markets. Over the last several years, in fact, we have invested in multiple new overseas offices in order to leverage existing relationships with global clients. We now have over 20 offices in markets such as the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, China, Singapore, Thailand, Brazil, and more recently, India, which positions us well to increasingly win international and global assignments. Over 10% of MDC Partners’ revenues were generated outside of North America in 2016. Over time, based on client demand, we expect our overseas presence to increase as a percent of the total business.
