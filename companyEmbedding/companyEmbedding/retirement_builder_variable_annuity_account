1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Answer a few questions to get started


















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
					
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss - investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.



          2.
	
	
	       
					If you are buying a variable annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit.


          3.
	
	
	       
					
Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims paying ability and financial strength.




Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and, in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          Annuities at Fidelity are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc. and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC.


          Fidelity Income Strategy Evaluator is an educational tool.

Answer a few questions to get started



















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC, and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., are the distributors.
	
    

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


          8. Restrictions may apply. Please refer to product materials for additional details.
	
    

          9. Minimum subsequent premium amounts and limitations to when they are allowed prior to income start date may apply.
	
    

          10. Restrictions may apply depending on payment option and/or contract type selected. The new income amount will be determined by the issuing insurance company. Please refer to the product materials for additional details.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Retirement Annuities










								Investing in your retirement
							
Variable deferred annuities offer the ability to invest your contributions in variable investment options, which may make them a good fit if you’re looking for market participation.
How variable deferred annuities work
When you purchase a variable deferred annuity, you have a diverse array of investment options available, each with varying levels of market risk and investment objectives.
You can choose an investment profile that matches your investment style and risk tolerance. A financial advisor can help you determine which options are suited to help you meet your financial goals.
Once purchased, you can change your investment allocation within your annuity at any time without creating a taxable event.
Choose your income strategy
When you are ready to begin receiving income from your annuity, at retirement or age 59½, you can select from a range of options.
These options allow you to structure an income that’s guaranteed to last for your lifetime, for a set period of time, for joint lives, and/or to provide for beneficiaries.
Optional living and death benefits
Because the value of your variable annuity contract can fluctuate with the ups and downs of the markets, variable deferred annuities often offer optional benefits to provide additional flexibility and protection.

Optional living benefits can help you protect, and in some cases even grow, your future guaranteed contract value or income – even in times of down markets
Optional death benefits can help protect – and, in some cases, enhance – your contract’s death benefit payable to your beneficiaries

Optional benefits are available for an additional cost.
Benefits to you

Opportunity for market exposure if you’re looking for potentially greater returns and can accept the accompanying risk
An assortment of investment options to choose from with varying ranges of risk and return
Tax deferral, which allows you to potentially grow assets faster
Opportunity to select optional benefits to further help grow, protect and sustain your retirement assets or income
If you choose to turn your annuity into a lifetime income stream, income options are available that are guaranteed for your lifetime, a period of time, and/or to provide for beneficiaries
Guaranteed death benefit to protect beneficiaries

 

Important information about variable annuities and optional living benefits
An annuity is intended to be a long-term, tax-deferred retirement vehicle. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed, and if withdrawn before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty. If the annuity will fund an IRA or other tax qualified plan, the tax deferral feature offers no additional value. Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are generally excluded from gross income, but taxes and penalties may apply to non-qualified distributions. Please consult a tax advisor for specific information. There are charges and expenses associated with annuities, such as deferred sales charges for early withdrawals. Variable annuities have additional expenses such as mortality and expense risk, administrative charges, investment management fees and rider fees. Variable annuities are subject to market fluctuation, investment risk and loss of principal.
Optional living benefits are available for an additional cost and may not be elected in combination with certain other optional benefits. They contain age and asset allocation requirements, holding period requirements, withdrawal limitations and other restrictions. Depending on the performance of the underlying investment, clients may never need to rely on the guarantees provided by the applicable optional benefit. Guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Guarantees have no bearing on the performance of the variable investment options. Not available in New York.
Product availability and features may vary by state.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a portfolio and the variable insurance product carefully before investing. The portfolio and variable insurance product prospectuses contain this and other information. You may obtain a copy of the prospectus from your representative. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

Two Types of Annuities for Retirement IncomeAnswered byByAnswered byRob WilliamsDirector of Income Planning, Schwab Center for Financial Research- March 27, 2013
Key Points
			Turning your retirement savings into income that will last can be a major challenge when you're preparing for and then living in retirement.
			Immediate fixed life annuities and variable annuities guarantee income that can't be outlived in retirement.
			Adding an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit to a variable annuity guarantees a minimum level of income, regardless of market fluctuations.
			Understanding the unique attributes of each can help you decide if they'll support your income plan.After all your hard work saving for retirement, you'll need to manage market risk and generate income that lasts. Annuities are one tool that can help—particularly if you're seeking a stream of income that you know will be around as long as you are.There are two types of annuities we believe may be worth considering to generate income: immediate fixed annuities and variable annuities. Many variable annuities offer an optional rider (often called guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, or GLWBs) that can provide additional protection for your income.Immediate fixed annuities provide pension-like income, while variable annuities provide a guaranteed stream of lifetime income at retirement, either through "annuitization" or the purchase of an optional GLWB rider.Under the standard annuitization option, an investor's retirement income is based on the performance of the underlying investment options he/she selected. Adding a GLWB rider locks-in a minimum level of income that can rise with the performance of the investment options but can never fall.
	Annuities add protections to your retirementFirst off, why consider an annuity? One reason beats all the others, in our view: Unlike a portfolio of stocks and bonds, annuities combine characteristics of standard investments with insurance features. Most life annuities provide a reliable stream of income that you can't outlive, and some can help you reduce or transfer the risk of investing in the market for part of your portfolio to an insurer.Annuities are also a way to systematically turn savings into income. This may seem complicated, but it's one of the most important steps to consider when managing your retirement portfolio—how, exactly, will you create regular withdrawals from your portfolio that will last?
	Immediate fixed annuities provide pension-like income for lifeImmediate fixed annuities are the oldest, most common type of annuity: you pay an insurance company a lump sum up front, and in return, you receive a fixed monthly payment for life (or some other specific time period)—a reliable stream of income you can't outlive.Immediate fixed life annuities may make sense, in our view, if you're seeking income now and don't want to worry about market fluctuations—at least for a portion of your savings. The insurance company manages those details and makes sure you receive a fixed payment that lasts for life. As long as the insurance company is solvent, you'll receive a payment for the same amount every month.If you live longer than average, you'll benefit from owning an immediate fixed life annuity. The rate of return depends on your initial investment and how long you live. Annuity experts call this a "mortality credit." If you live longer than other investors, you'll benefit. In fact, it may be most useful to think about an immediate fixed annuity not purely as compared to other investments, but more for its insurance features.What about the current low-interest-rate environment—can that impact payments from an annuity? It may not make the most sense to load up on immediate fixed annuities when interest rates are low, as the payments depend, to a degree, on the market. But if you need guaranteed income, it probably won't pay to wait too long either. One strategy is to stagger your purchase of immediate fixed annuities over time, much like a bond ladder but using annuities, as your guaranteed income needs grow.It's worth noting that monthly payments from immediate fixed life annuities are generally higher the older you are at the time of purchase. The insurer anticipates that it will be making payments for a shorter period of time, so it can pay a higher proportion of the lump sum on a monthly basis. This feature isn't shared by variable annuities with GLWBs.
	Variable annuities with GLWBs: income protection, flexibility and growth potentialIn contrast to immediate fixed annuities, variable annuities with an optional GLWB rider don't require that you to turn cash over irrevocably to an insurance company. Rather, the investor retains control of the money and makes withdrawals from a portfolio of investments that is held within the variable annuity.When purchased with a GLWB feature (at an additional cost), the rider may protect against market downturns by guaranteeing your ability to take withdrawals for life at a certain minimum level, no matter how the market performs, without annuitizing the contract. In other words, you can stay invested in the market and benefit from flexibility and potential for growth.You should be aware, however, that the GLWB is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. Your actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal, though you'll continue to take income for life even if withdrawals and market losses deplete your annuity's value to zero. There's also an annual cost associated with the additional rider.This type of annuity can be more complex than immediate fixed annuities, so it's important to examine the details and talk with a professional to make sure you understand them thoroughly. But at the most basic level, purchasing a GLWB rider with a variable annuity adds an additional layer of protections to a portfolio of investments held within a variable annuity to generate retirement income. If markets don't perform well, you have protections, and if they perform better than expected, you have some potential for growth (after accounting for fees and withdrawals).One tradeoff compared to immediate fixed annuities is that variable annuities with GLWBs generally promise a lower guaranteed payment initially once withdrawals begin. A "typical" guaranteed annual withdrawal rate from a variable annuity with GLWB may be 5% of an "income base" generally based on the highest contract anniversary value the contract achieved since purchase of the GLWB rider. An immediate fixed life annuity will generally quote a monthly or annual payment. But the amount of the withdrawal, if calculated as a percentage of the lump sum invested, will generally be higher.Another consideration is cost. GLWB riders are purchased at an additional cost, generally starting at around 0.8% per year and rising. This is the cost of adding more protections to the flexibility and growth potential. Besides the cost of the rider, variable annuities are subject to a number of charges. These charges will reduce the value of your account and return on your investments.
	How to choose an annuity for youBoth types of annuities—immediate fixed and variable with GLWBs—provide guaranteed income in retirement, but neither type will be right for every investor. Do you value a higher guaranteed lifetime income in a simple package, or do you value flexibility and growth potential? Are you still preparing for retirement and looking to protect part of your savings, or are you already well into retirement and looking for income now?The table below shows factors to consider when choosing which type might make sense for you compared to, or (more typically) as a complement to a traditional portfolio.Factors to Take Into Account When Considering AnnuitiesFactors to ConsiderImmediate Fixed AnnuitiesVariable Annuities With GLWBsTraditional PortfolioIncome guarantees*Insurer pledges to make income payments that last for a fixed period of life.Insurer generally pledges to protect minimum annual withdrawals from the variable annuity for life.No guarantees on lifetime income; interest paid on bonds subject to credit risk of issue. May withdraw principal to supplement portfolio income.LiquidityNo liquidity after a lump sum is turned over irrevocably to the annuity provider.While annuities shouldn't be considered liquid, you do retain control over assets and aren't required to turn over lump sum in exchange for income; tax penalties or loss of guarantees may apply if annual withdrawals exceed a guaranteed minimum. Surrender charges may also apply for early withdrawals.Most liquid, depending on investment choices and market performance.Market participationNone-annuity provider assumes market risk.Owner has potential to participate in market growth, after accounting for fees and withdrawals.Maximum market participation, though accompanied by the most market risk.FlexibilityInflexibleYou retain control over investments, subject to limitations on choices offered in annuity chosen; more flexible than immediate fixed annuities.Most flexible--you retain full control over your investments.LongevitySimplest form of protection against longevity risk; initial payout generally higher than variable annuities with GLWBs, but generally fixed.Provides guaranteed withdrawals for life from a portfolio of investments; final payout generally lower than immediate annuities, but potential to increase depending on market performance.A disciplined spending plan can lead to high confidence that assets won't be outlived, but does not promise lifetime income.CostCost embedded in up-front cost of purchases.Annual investments fees, insurance costs, fees for optional riders, potential surrender charges and other possible expenses.No added insurance or annuity fee; costs of underlying investments still apply.Note: * All guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the insurer.It's possible to choose a combination of all three, depending on your needs. Each approach has pluses and minuses that can work in isolation or together. Immediate fixed annuities provide higher guaranteed income for the cost, while variable annuities with GLWBs help flexibly protect retirement income from market risk. And of course a traditional portfolio provides the most flexibility at the lowest cost of the three approaches, but doesn't include lifetime income protection.
	How much should you invest?As a general rule of thumb, we don't believe you should commit more than 50% of your investable assets to either type of annuity. Most investors will want some assets available for liquidity as well as full growth potential without additional fees.If you value lifetime income, you may wish to consider predictable income sources such as lifetime income from annuities, to cover essential expenditures in retirement—then invest the rest for liquidity and growth. For more insights on how to build your retirement income, see Schwab's Retirement Income Fundamentals.
	Next stepsIf you need help learning about annuities, you're not alone. The details can be complex, so it'll help to talk to an unbiased professional who can weigh the pros and cons.

Important DisclosuresVariable annuities are sold by prospectus only. You can request a prospectus by calling 888-311-4887 or by visiting schwab.com/annuity. Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully read the prospectus and consider the annuity's investment objectives and all risks, charges, and expenses associated with the annuity and its investment options.The contract value of a variable annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid and it is possible to lose money.All annuity guarantees are subject to the financial health and claim-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Neither Schwab nor its affiliates provides insurance guarantees.A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit is an optional rider available for an additional charge. It is not a contract value, cannot be accessed like a cash value, and will not preserve your account value which will deplete with each withdrawal until it reaches zero, though payments under the terms of the rider will still continue for life. Withdrawals in excess of the specified annual payout amount will permanently reduce future income.Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes and offer tax deferral on potential growth; however, withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty in addition to applicable income taxes. Variable annuities are also subject to a number of fees including mortality and risk expense charges, administrative fees, premium taxes, investment management fees, and charges for additional optional features. Although there are no surrender charges on the variable annuities offered by Schwab, such charges do apply in the early years of many contracts.Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a licensed insurance agency, distributes certain life insurance and annuity contracts that are issued by non-affiliated insurance companies. Not all products are available in all states.Unlike a CD, which is an FDIC-insured bank product, an annuity's payment guarantees are provided by and only as strong as the financial position and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Schwab does not provide any insurance or other guarantee. Consult the insurance company's ratings for its financial strength, and read the annuity contract and/or prospectus before investing. Insurance company ratings do not apply to the performance of variable subaccounts. Ratings subject to change. There is no guarantee current ratings will be maintained.The information presented does not consider your particular investment objectives or financial situation and does not make personalized recommendations.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Yes! Please send me my FREE copy of Dr. Mark Skousen’s Annuity “Death Traps,” as well as Mark’s free weekly e-letter, Investor CAFÉ, along with other financial news and offers.




 
IN THIS REPORT:

Understanding the 3 types of annuities peddled by insurance salesmen
The 4 income traps (“retirement death traps”) hidden in the fine print
A little-known way to collect 14 payouts a year with the “Super 7 Annuity”


Hi, I’m Dr. Mark Skousen.
A word of caution: If you’re thinking of investing in an insurance annuity for its “guaranteed income”…
I urge you to think twice.
You see, annuities are often sold as one thing, but in reality turn out to be quite another thing altogether.
And you could end up making substantially less money than you counted on.
In my new report, I share the truth about annuities… the straight facts you’ll never hear from your annuity salesman.
So here’s what I suggest: Access your free copy of Annuity “Death Traps” by telling us where to send it in the box above or below.
Read it, and decide for yourself if annuities are right for you and your family.

Earn Uncorrelated Returns of up to 5% In Shorter Term Maturities
Fixed annuity payment streams offer the opportunity for “yield alpha.” Because the periodic payments from annuities are unrated cashflows, they can be purchased at a discount. However, these same payment streams are backed by insurance companies rated A or better by A.M. Best Company.
Combined, these two features enable our clients to realize above average, risk adjusted returns of up to 5% annually.
Fixed annuities fund a variety of obligations including lotteries, personal injury settlements and investments. These secondary market annuities enable investors to capitalize on cashflows from a variety of diversified sources.
Structured Settlement Benefits

Higher Yields. Opportunities in structured settlements offer significantly higher yields than comparable fixed rate products.
Uncorrelated. Because structured settlement cashflows are long term insurance company obligations, they are generally considered to be uncorrelated to the economy at large.
Proven. Historically, defaults on annuity payments have been a fraction of the defaults typically associated with commercial loans.
Safer. Structured settlement cashflows are backed by insurance companies rated A or better. Even insurance companies that have merged, acquired or ceased operations are backed by runoff insurance which pays outstanding obligations such as payment streams.
Regulated. Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation which includes federal oversight in addition to state-by-state insurance commissions.
Steady. Buyers of structured settlement payment streams receive regular, monthly payments following their initial investment.




"When I was looking at financial products, I had no shortage of firm choices. What I did have a shortage of was people at those firms who took the time to listen to me instead of trying to sell me on something that didn’t fit my needs. Woodbridge offered a completely different experience. They were more interested in listening to me than selling to me. They won my respect then, and they have continued to earn it every day since." – Robert A. Daddis

Investing in Annuities for Your Retirement
 
Retirement in your golden years goes much more smoothly when you've planned ahead with savings and investments. Annuities are a great way to secure your future and live life to the fullest. When you get life insurance, you invest in the future of your family, with annuities you can invest in your own future, as well as your families. You are responsible for yourself and your future, so make sure it's enjoyable by preparing ahead of time.
Annuities are customized by the individual or individuals involved. There are many different options and many providers. Before jumping into it, a lot of thought must be given such as planning what you will need for retirement and what you can afford now. You can discuss these with licensed agents by filling out our quick form so we can connect you with the right licensed agents for your needs. You can then compare annuity quotes with a strong foundation of knowledge.
Who Needs Annuities When I Have Social Security?
Many people are not expecting Social Security to provide all of their retirement needs. For many, it is insufficient, and others are concerned about the long-term stability of the Social Security system and want to have a back-up plan.
Online Insurance Quotes for Your Retirement
Just like obtaining homeowners insurance, planning for your retirement is an important part of ensuring you are financially secure for the rest of your life. Annuity policies are a great way of setting up a fixed or guaranteed income for your retirement. When you shop for online insurance quotes, you can find the right option for your financial needs. There are many benefits to choosing this as part of your retirement plan. Before you can make the right choice, you may want to find out more about this valuable retirement tool.
The simplest explanation of an annuity is a scheduled set of payments that exist for a predetermined period of time. The schedule for and amount of the annuity payments will rely largely on your retirement goals and the period of time until you retire.  Once you have made your scheduled payments, or investments, you will be able to begin receiving payments.  These disbursements will serve as your retirement income. 
Many people prefer annuities for retirement because they come in many flexible options and they provide a guaranteed income upon retirement. The main types are:

Immediate -      Allow you to be paid a set amount of money on a predetermined schedule.
Fixed Period Annuities - Are a more conservative option and come with a minimum interest      rate guaranteed.
Equity-Indexed - Give you the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return.
Variable Annuities - The most      flexible annuity and are subject to rises similar to stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #11: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation.

2017's Best Annuities - Find the annuities with the highest rates, lowest fees and highest guaranteed returns in our free report




Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #8: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #9:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 







Tip #5: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.

Our Free Report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases








Tip #7: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns.

Tip #4:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #3: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database. 




Tip #2:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 











Tip #1:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
