Across 51 industries, we find significant differences in both the rate and time-series clustering of these activities. The interindustry patterns in the rate of takeovers and restructurings are directly related to the economic shocks borne by the sample industries. These results support the argument that much of the takeover activity during the 1980s was driven by broad fundamental factors and have general implications for the stock price spillover effects of takeover announcements, corporate performance following takeovers, and the timing of takeover waves.KeywordsIndustry shockTakeoverRestructuringMergersacquisitionsJEL classificationG34Choose an option to locate/access this article:Check if you have access through your login credentials or your institution.Sign InorPurchaseorCheck for this article elsewhereRecommended articlesCiting articles (0)☆Mark Carhart, Violet Law, and David Schanzer provided research assistance.Copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier B.V.Recommended articlesCiting articles

History[edit]
Mark Blumes, formerly a retail executive for the Hudson's Bay Company, opened Mark's Work Wearhouse in Calgary, Alberta on August 14, 1977. The store was located in the Southeast corner of Calgary at Centre Street and Glenmore Trail. Following early success and rapid expansion, the company became publicly traded in 1981 with an Initial Public Offering worth $14,000,000. In 1995, the Board of Directors appointed Garth Mitchell as President and Chief Operating Officer of the company. Under Mitchell, the chain entered a new phase characterized by growth and acquisition.[clarification needed] The 140 stores in 1996 generated a revenue of $250 million, and the company acquired Work World which increased revenues by $500 million in six years. In 2002, Canadian Tire Corporation purchased Mark’s Work Wearhouse for $116 million as part of a strategic plan to add strong and profitable growth within the company’s integrated portfolio of businesses.[1] At this time, Mark's Work Wearhouse operated 325 corporate and franchisee stores across the country. The acquisition provided Mark’s Work Wearhouse with significant working capital, resulting in accelerated growth between 2001 and 2008. Sales grew from $500 million to $1 billion, with 372 stores across Canada. Together, Mark’s Work Wearhouse and Canadian Tire created “combo stores” at 65 Canadian Tire locations which coupled the complete assortment of a Canadian Tire store with a fully serviced Mark’s Work Wearhouse. In 2012, the company underwent a rebrand as part of its strategy to appeal to a wider customer base and reflect its expanded product assortment. Now referred to as Mark’s, the brand launched its newest ad campaign ‘Ready for This’ in 2013.

In fall 2014 Mark's launched an exclusive licence with the Canadian designer brand ALFRED SUNG for a collection of women's apparel under the SUNG ALFRED SUNG name. Mark's recently rebranded their men's and women's activewear under the names MATRIX and SHAMBHALA, respectively.

History[edit]
Mark Blumes, formerly a retail executive for the Hudson's Bay Company, opened Mark's Work Wearhouse in Calgary, Alberta on August 14, 1977. The store was located in the Southeast corner of Calgary at Centre Street and Glenmore Trail. Following early success and rapid expansion, the company became publicly traded in 1981 with an Initial Public Offering worth $14,000,000. In 1995, the Board of Directors appointed Garth Mitchell as President and Chief Operating Officer of the company. Under Mitchell, the chain entered a new phase characterized by growth and acquisition.[clarification needed] The 140 stores in 1996 generated a revenue of $250 million, and the company acquired Work World which increased revenues by $500 million in six years. In 2002, Canadian Tire Corporation purchased Mark’s Work Wearhouse for $116 million as part of a strategic plan to add strong and profitable growth within the company’s integrated portfolio of businesses.[1] At this time, Mark's Work Wearhouse operated 325 corporate and franchisee stores across the country. The acquisition provided Mark’s Work Wearhouse with significant working capital, resulting in accelerated growth between 2001 and 2008. Sales grew from $500 million to $1 billion, with 372 stores across Canada. Together, Mark’s Work Wearhouse and Canadian Tire created “combo stores” at 65 Canadian Tire locations which coupled the complete assortment of a Canadian Tire store with a fully serviced Mark’s Work Wearhouse. In 2012, the company underwent a rebrand as part of its strategy to appeal to a wider customer base and reflect its expanded product assortment. Now referred to as Mark’s, the brand launched its newest ad campaign ‘Ready for This’ in 2013.
