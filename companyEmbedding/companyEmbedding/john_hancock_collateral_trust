	PROXY STATEMENT






	 






	ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS



	TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 24, 2017









	INTRODUCTION










	This proxy statement contains the information that a shareholder should know before voting on the proposal described in the
	notice.


	Each fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its Annual Report and/or Semiannual Report to any shareholder upon request
	by writing to the fund at 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210 or by calling 800-852-0218.










	This proxy statement is being used in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") for
	use at the annual meeting of shareholders of each of John Hancock Income Securities Trust ("Income Securities") and John Hancock
	Investors Trust ("Investors"). The meeting will be held at 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, on Tuesday, January
	24, 2017, at 2:00 P.M., Eastern time (the "Meeting"). Shareholders of each fund are being asked to vote on the proposal to
	elect thirteen (13) Trustees.








	The proxy statement and proxy card are intended to be first mailed to shareholders on or about December 1, 2016.








	Although the annual meetings of the funds are being held jointly and proxies are being solicited through the use of this joint
	proxy statement, shareholders of each fund will vote separately. In the event that any shareholder present at the meetings
	objects to the holding of a joint meeting and moves for an adjournment of the annual meeting with respect to his or her fund
	to a time immediately after the annual meetings so that his or her fund's meeting may be held separately, the persons named
	as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment.

	John Hancock Advisers, LLC (the "Advisor"), located at 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, serves as each fund's
	investment advisor and administrator. An affiliate of the Advisor, John Hancock Asset Management a division of Manulife Asset
	Management (US) LLC, located at 197 Clarendon Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, serves as subadvisor to each fund.

	as a distributor to Investors in connection with the fund's shelf offering program.













	Record Ownership









	The Trustees of each fund have fixed the close of business on November 7, 2016, as the record date for determining shareholders
	eligible to vote at the Meeting (the "Record Date"). All shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date
	are entitled to one vote for each share (and fractional votes for fractional shares) on all business of the Meeting or any

	PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF TRUSTEES











	General









	Holders of the shares of each fund are entitled to elect thirteen Trustees at this Meeting. Charles L. Bardelis, James R.
	Boyle, Craig Bromley, Peter S. Burgess, William H. Cunningham, Grace K. Fey, Theron S. Hoffman, Hassell H. McClellan, Deborah
	C. Jackson, James M. Oates, Steven R. Pruchansky, Gregory A. Russo and Warren A. Thomson have been designated as subject to
	election by holders of the shares of each fund.








	As of the date of this proxy, each nominee for election currently serves as a Trustee of each fund, and if re-elected will
	serve until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified.








	Using the enclosed proxy card, a shareholder may authorize the proxies to vote his or her shares for the nominees, or the
	shareholder may withhold from the proxies authority to vote his or her shares for one or more of the nominees. If no contrary
	instructions are given, the proxies will vote FOR the nominees. Each of the nominees has consented to his or her nomination
	and has agreed to serve if elected. If, for any reason, any nominee should not be available for election or not be able to
	serve as a Trustee, the proxies will exercise their voting power in favor of such substitute nominee, if any, as the funds'
	Trustees may designate. The funds have no reason to believe that it will be necessary to designate any substitute nominees.













	Proposal









	For each fund, Charles L. Bardelis, James R. Boyle, Craig Bromley, Peter S. Burgess, William H. Cunningham, Grace K. Fey,
	Theron S. Hoffman, Hassell H. McClellan, Deborah C. Jackson, James M. Oates, Steven R. Pruchansky, Gregory A. Russo and Warren
	A. Thomson are the current nominees for election by the shareholders.








	The vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares of a fund is sufficient to elect each nominee to serve as a Trustee
	of that fund.









	The Board recommends that shareholders of each fund vote "FOR" each of the thirteen (13) nominees in the Proposal.














	Information About Nominees/Trustees









	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the nominees for election to the Board. The table also shows
	each nominee's principal occupation or employment and other directorships during the past five years and the number of John
	Hancock funds overseen by each of the current Trustees as of November 1, 2016. There are currently thirteen Trustees of each
	fund, ten of whom are not "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"))
	of the funds ("Independent Trustees"). The business address of each nominee is 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts
	02210.

	Additional Information About Nominees/Trustees









	In addition to the description of each Trustee's Principal Occupation(s) and Other Directorships set forth above, the following
	provides further information about each Trustee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills. The information
	in this section should not be understood to mean that any of the Trustees is an "expert" within the meaning of the federal
	securities laws.








	There are no specific required qualifications for Board membership. The Board believes that the different perspectives, viewpoints,
	professional experience, education, and individual qualities of each Trustee represent a diversity of experiences and a variety
	of complementary skills. Each Trustee has experience as a Trustee of each fund as well as experience as a Trustee of other
	John Hancock funds. It is the Trustees' belief that this allows the Board, as a whole, to oversee the business of each fund
	in a manner consistent with the best interests of the fund's shareholders. When considering potential nominees to fill vacancies
	on the Board, and as part of its annual self-evaluation, the Board reviews the mix of skills and other relevant experiences
	of the Trustees.

	Duties of Trustees; Board Meetings and Board Committees









	Each fund is organized as a Massachusetts business trust. Under the funds' Declarations of Trusts, the Trustees are responsible
	for managing the affairs of the funds, including the appointment of advisors and subadvisors. Each Trustee has the experience,
	skills, attributes or qualifications described above (see "Principal Occupation(s) and Other Directorships During the Past
	Five Years" and "Additional Information About Nominees/Trustees" above). The Board appoints officers who assist in managing
	the day-to-day affairs of the funds. The Board met six times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. No Trustee attended
	fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of Board meetings; and (2) the total number of meetings held by all
	committees on which he or she served. The funds hold joint meetings of the Trustees and all committees. One Trustee attended
	the joint 2016 annual meeting of shareholders of the funds that was held on February 3, 2016.








	The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee as Chairperson. The Chairperson presides at meetings of the Trustees, and may
	call meetings of the Board and any Board committee whenever he deems it necessary. The Chairperson participates in the preparation
	of the agenda for meetings of the Board and the identification of information to be presented to the Board with respect to
	matters to be acted upon by the Board. The Chairperson also acts as a liaison with the funds' management, officers, attorneys,
	and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Chairperson may perform such other functions as may be requested by the
	Board from time to time. The Board has also designated a Vice Chairperson to serve in the absence of the Chairperson. Except
	for any duties specified pursuant to each fund's Declaration of Trust or By-laws, or as assigned by the Board, the designation
	of a Trustee as Chairperson or Vice Chairperson does not impose on that Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that
	are greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on any other Trustee, generally. The Board has designated a
	number of standing committees as further described below, each of which has a Chairperson. The Board also may designate working
	groups or ad hoc committees as it deems appropriate.

	Table of Contents









	The Board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent
	judgment over matters under its purview, and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees or working groups of Trustees
	and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board considers leadership by an Independent Trustee
	as Chairperson to be integral to promoting effective independent oversight of the funds' operations and meaningful representation
	of the shareholders' interests, given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the funds. The Board also believes
	that having a super-majority of Independent Trustees is appropriate and in the best interest of the funds' shareholders. Nevertheless,
	the Board also believes that having interested persons serve on the Board brings corporate and financial viewpoints that are,
	in the Board's view, helpful elements in its decision-making process. In addition, the Board believes that Messrs. Boyle,
	Bromley, and Thomson, as current or former senior executives of MFC, the parent company of the Advisor and of other affiliates
	of the Advisor, provide the Board with the perspective of the Advisor in managing and sponsoring all of the funds. The leadership
	structure of the Board may be changed, at any time and in the discretion of the Board, including in response to changes in
	circumstances or the characteristics of each fund.













	Board Committees









	The Board has established an Audit Committee; Compliance Committee; Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee; Nominating and Governance
	Committee; and Investment Committee.








	The current membership of each committee is set forth below.









	Audit Committee

	. The Board has an Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
	(the "Exchange Act"), which comprises Independent Trustees (Messrs. Bardelis, Burgess and Hoffman) as defined under Section
	2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. Burgess serves as Chairperson of this Committee. Each Audit Committee member is financially
	literate, with at least one having accounting or financial management expertise. The Board has adopted a written charter for
	the Committee. This Committee recommends to the full Board independent registered public accounting firms for each fund, oversees
	the work of the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with each fund's audit, communicates with the
	independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis and provides a forum for the independent registered public
	accounting firm to report and discuss any matters it deems appropriate at any time. The Audit Committee held four meetings
	during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. The written report of the Audit Committee is set forth below under "Audit Committee
	Report." The written charter of the Audit Committee is included as Attachment 1 to this proxy statement.









	Compliance Committee

	. The Board also has a standing Compliance Committee (Ms. Jackson and Messrs. Cunningham and McClellan). This Committee reviews
	and makes recommendations to the full Board regarding certain compliance matters relating to the funds. Mr. McClellan serves
	as Chairperson of this Committee. This Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.









	Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee

	. The Board also has a standing Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee (Ms. Fey and Messrs. Pruchansky and Russo). This Committee
	oversees the initiation, operation, and renewal of the various contracts between the funds and other entities. These contracts
	include advisory and subadvisory agreements, custodial and transfer agency agreements and arrangements with other service
	providers. The Committee also reviews the significant legal affairs of the funds, as well as any significant regulatory and
	legislative actions or proposals affecting or relating to the funds or their service providers. The Committee also assists
	the Board in its oversight role with respect to the processes pursuant to which the Advisor and the Subadvisor identify, manage
	and report the various risks that affect or could affect the funds. Mr. Russo serves as Chairperson of this Committee. The
	Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.









	Nominating & Governance Committee

	. This Committee comprises all of the Independent Trustees as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. Oates serves
	as Chairperson of this Committee. The purpose of this Committee is to make determinations and recommendations to the Board
	on issues related to the composition and operation of the Board and corporate governance matters applicable to the Independent
	Trustees. This Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates.
	This Committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.








	Each fund's Board has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee. A copy of the Charter is included
	as Attachment 2 to this proxy statement. This Committee will consider nominees recommended by fund shareholders. Any recommendations
	from shareholders shall be directed to the Secretary of the relevant fund at 601 Congress Street, 11th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts
	02210. Any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under
	the Exchange Act in order to be considered by the Committee. In evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder, the Committee,
	in addition to the criteria discussed below, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that nomination
	and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders.








	The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited
	to) the following criteria: (i) the nominee's reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards, and such other personal characteristics
	as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others; (ii) the nominee's business, professional, academic, financial, accounting or other
	experience and qualifications, which demonstrate that he or she will make a valuable contribution as Trustee; (iii) a commitment to understand the funds and the
	responsibilities of a trustee of an investment company; (iv) a commitment to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees; (v)
	the ability to understand potential conflicts of interest involving management of the funds and to act in the interests of all shareholders; (vi) the
	absence of a real or apparent conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the
	responsibilities of an Independent Trustee; and (vii) experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities. The Committee may determine
	that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Committee finds that
	the criteria satisfied by the candidate




	 













	7















	Table of Contents









	and the candidate's other qualifications demonstrate the appropriate level of fitness to serve. This Committee will strive
	to achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences in respect of industries, professions and other experiences, and that is diversified as to gender
	and race.




	As long as a current Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of this Committee, to satisfy these criteria, each fund
	anticipates that the Committee would favor the re-nomination of a current Independent Trustee rather than a new candidate.
	Consequently, while this Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as Independent Trustees, the
	Committee may act upon such recommendations only if there is a vacancy on the Board or the Committee determines that the selection
	of a new or additional Independent Trustee is in the best interests of a fund.








	While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates,
	the Committee may consider nominees recommended by any source, including shareholders, management, legal counsel and Board
	members, as it deems appropriate. All recommendations shall include all information relating to such person that is required
	to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of Board members and as specified in the relevant fund's By-Laws,
	and must be accompanied by a written consent of the proposed candidate to stand for election if nominated for the Board and
	to serve if elected by shareholders. The Committee's process for identifying and evaluating nominees to serve as Independent
	Trustees of the funds is set forth in Annex A to the Committee's Charter.









	Investment Committee

	. The Board also has an Investment Committee composed of all of the Trustees. The Investment Committee has five subcommittees
	with the Trustees divided among the five subcommittees (each an "Investment Sub-Committee"). Each Investment Sub-Committee
	reviews investment matters relating to a particular group of funds and coordinates with the full Board regarding investment
	matters. Mses. Fey and Jackson and Messrs. Hoffman, Bardelis and Cunningham serve as Chairpersons of the Investment Sub-Committees.
	The Investment Sub-Committee that oversees the funds held five meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.








	Annually, the Board evaluates its performance and that of its Committees, including the effectiveness of the Board's Committee
	structure.













	Risk Oversight









	As registered investment companies, the Funds are subject to a variety of risks, including investment risks (such as, among
	others, market risk, credit risk and interest rate risk), financial risks (such as, among others, settlement risk, liquidity
	risk and valuation risk), compliance risks, and operational risks. As a part of its overall activities, the Board oversees
	the Funds' risk management activities that are implemented by the Advisor, the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") and
	other service providers to the Funds. The Advisor has primary responsibility for the Funds' risk management on a day-to-day
	basis as a part of its overall responsibilities. The Funds' Subadvisors, subject to oversight of the Advisor, are primarily
	responsible for managing investment and financial risks as a part of their day-to-day investment responsibilities, as well
	as operational and compliance risks at their firms. The Advisor and the CCO also assist the Board in overseeing compliance
	with investment policies of the Funds and regulatory requirements, and monitor the implementation of the various compliance
	policies and procedures approved by the Board as a part of its oversight responsibilities.









	The Advisor identifies to the Board the risks that it believes may affect the Funds and develops processes and controls regarding
	such risks. However, risk management is a complex and dynamic undertaking and it is not always possible to comprehensively
	identify and/or mitigate all such risks at all times since risks are at times impacted by external events. In discharging
	its oversight responsibilities, the Board considers risk management issues throughout the year with the assistance of its
	various Committees as described below. Each Committee meets at least quarterly and presents reports to the Board, which may
	prompt further discussion of issues concerning the oversight of the Funds' risk management. The Board as a whole also reviews
	written reports or presentations on a variety of risk issues as needed and may discuss particular risks that are not addressed
	in the Committee process.








	The Board has established an Investment Committee, which consists of five Investment Sub-Committees. Each Investment Sub-Committee
	assists the Board in overseeing the significant investment policies of the relevant Funds and the performance of their Subadvisors.
	The Advisor monitors these policies and Subadvisor activities and may recommend changes in connection with the Funds to each
	relevant Investment Sub-Committee in response to a Subadvisor's requests or other circumstances. On at least a quarterly basis,
	each Investment Sub-Committee reviews reports from the Advisor regarding the relevant Funds' investment performance, which
	include information about investment and financial risks and how they are managed, and from the CCO regarding Subadvisor compliance
	matters. In addition, each Investment Sub-Committee meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the Funds' Subadvisors
	to receive reports regarding management of the Funds, including with respect to risk management processes.








	The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing with the independent auditors, at various times throughout the year, matters
	relating to the Funds' financial reporting. In addition, this Committee oversees the process of each Fund's valuation of its
	portfolio securities, assisted by the Funds' Pricing Committee (composed of officers of the Trust), which calculates fair
	value determinations pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board.








	The Compliance Committee assists the Board in overseeing the activities of the Trust's CCO with respect to the compliance
	programs of the Funds, the Advisor, the Subadvisors, and certain of the Funds' other service providers (the Distributor and
	transfer agent). This Committee and the Board receive and consider periodic reports from the CCO throughout the year, including
	the CCO's annual written report, which, among other things, summarizes material compliance issues that arose during the previous
	year and any remedial action taken to address these issues, as well as any material changes to the compliance programs.








	The Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight role with respect to the processes pursuant to which
	the Advisor and the Subadvisors identify, assess, manage and report the various risks that affect or could affect the Funds.
	This Committee reviews reports from the Funds' Advisor on a periodic basis regarding the risks facing the Funds, and makes
	recommendations to the Board concerning risks and risk oversight matters as the Committee deems appropriate. This Committee
	also coordinates with the other Board Committees regarding risks relevant to the other Committees, as appropriate.








	In addressing issues regarding the Funds' risk management between meetings, appropriate representatives of the Advisor communicate
	with the Chairperson of the Board, the relevant Committee Chair, or the Trust's CCO, who is directly accountable to the Board. As appropriate,
	the Chairperson of the Board, the

	Table of Contents









	Committee Chairs and the Trustees confer among themselves, with the Trust's CCO, the Advisor, other service providers, external
	fund counsel, and counsel to the Independent Trustees, to identify and review risk management issues that may be placed on the full Board's agenda and/or
	that of an appropriate Committee for review and discussion.




	In addition, in its annual review of the Funds' advisory, subadvisory and distribution agreements, the Board reviews information
	provided by the Advisor, the Subadvisors and the Distributor relating to their operational capabilities, financial condition,
	risk management processes and resources.








	The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts its risk oversight role.








	The Advisor also has its own, independent interest in risk management. In this regard, the Advisor has appointed a Risk and
	Investment Operations Committee, consisting of senior personnel from each of the Advisor's functional departments. This Committee
	reports periodically to the Board and the Contracts, Legal & Risk Committee on risk management matters. The Advisor's risk
	management program is part of the overall risk management program of John Hancock, the Advisor's parent company. John Hancock's
	Chief Risk Officer supports the Advisor's risk management program, and at the Board's request will report on risk management
	matters.

	Trustee share ownership is provided as of October 31, 2016. The amounts reflect the aggregate dollar range of equity securities
	beneficially owned by the Trustees in the funds and in all John Hancock funds overseen by each Trustee. The information as
	to beneficial ownership is based on statements furnished to the funds by the Trustees. Each of the Trustees has all voting
	and investment powers with respect to the shares indicated.













	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance









	Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires a fund's executive officers, Trustees and persons who own more than 10% of a fund's
	shares ("10% Shareholders") to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission
	("SEC"). Executive officers, Trustees and 10% Shareholders are also required by SEC regulations to furnish each fund with
	copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of these reports furnished to the funds
	and representations that no other reports were required to be filed, each fund believes that, during the past fiscal year,

	Audit Committee Report









	The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or incorporated by reference
	in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that
	we specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.








	The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the funds' management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") the audited
	financial statements of the funds contained in the annual reports on Form N-CSR for the most recent fiscal year.* The Audit
	Committee also has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board Auditing Standards, AU Section 380, which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of
	the funds' financial statements.








	The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence
	and has discussed with PwC its independence from the funds.








	Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee, pursuant to the authority delegated to the Audit
	Committee by the Board of Trustees, approved the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the fund's annual report
	on Form N-CSR for filing with the SEC.

	Report issued on December 8, 2015








	* For purposes of this report, the funds' most recently completed fiscal year is October 31, 2015.













	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm









	The Trustees of each fund, including a majority of each fund's Independent Trustees, have selected PwC, 101 Seaport Boulevard,
	Suite 500, Boston, MA 02210, to act as independent registered public accounting firm.








	Representatives of PwC are not expected to be present at the meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement,
	if they desire to do so, and will be available should any matter arise requiring their participation.








	The following tables set forth the aggregate fees billed by PwC for the funds' two most recently completed fiscal years for
	professional services rendered for (i) the audit of the funds' annual financial statements and the review of financial statements
	included in the funds' reports to shareholders, (ii) assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance
	of the audit or review of the funds' financial statements, (iii) tax compliance, tax advice or tax planning and (iv) all other
	services provided by PwC other than (i), (ii) and (iii). None of the services described below were approved by the Audit Committee
	pursuant to the "de minimis exception" from the pre-approval requirement set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation
	S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

	Each fund's Audit Committee has adopted procedures that require the pre-approval of audit and nonaudit services provided by
	the fund's independent registered public accounting firm to the fund, the Advisor and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control
	with the Advisor that provide services to each fund (the "Advisor Affiliates") and that relate directly to each fund's operations and financial reporting.
	In addition, these procedures identify




	 













	11















	Table of Contents









	certain types of audit and non-audit services that are anticipated to be provided by PwC during a calendar year and, provided
	the services are within the scope and value standards set forth in the procedures, such services are deemed to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
	The scope and value criteria are reviewed annually. Unless a service is pre-approved under the procedures, it must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit
	Committee.




	In recommending PwC as the funds' independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has considered the compensation
	paid to PwC for audit and non-audit services to the Advisor and the Advisor Affiliates, and has determined that such compensation
	is not incompatible with maintaining PwC's independence.








	The following table sets forth the aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to each fund for the two most
	recently completed fiscal years.

	The aggregate non-audit fees billed by PwC for services rendered to the Advisor and the Advisor Affiliates for the fiscal
	years ended October 31, 2016 and October 31, 2015, amounted to $4,586,524 and $7,121,652, respectively.













	Required Vote for Proposal 1









	Approval of Proposal 1 will require a plurality of all votes cast, assuming a quorum exists. A "plurality" means that the
	thirteen Nominees presented for election receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected as Trustees, regardless of
	the number of votes cast.









	The Board of Trustees, including all the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" Proposal 1.















	MISCELLANEOUS











	Voting Procedures









	Directions to attend the Meeting where shareholders may vote in person can be found on our website at www.jhinvestments.com/proxy.
	Valid photo identification may be required to attend the Meeting in person.

	All valid proxies will be voted in accordance with specifications thereon, or in the absence of specifications, for each Nominee
	in the proposal.

	The proposal described in this proxy statement is considered a routine matter on which brokers holding shares in "street
	name" may vote on this proposal without instruction under the rules of the NYSE.










	Revocation of Proxies

	.

	Proxies may be revoked at any time before the Meeting either (i) by a written revocation received by the Secretary of the
	funds, (ii) by a properly executed later-dated proxy received by the Secretary of the funds, or (iii) by an in-person vote
	at the Meeting. Attendance at the Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a proxy. Shareholders may revoke a proxy as often
	as they wish before the Meeting. Only the latest dated, properly executed proxy card received prior to or at the Meeting will
	be counted.










	Quorum.


	Shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment
	of the Meeting. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund at the close of business on that date present
	in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the Meeting.








	Shareholders are entitled to one vote for each share held and fractional votes for fractional shares held. No shares have
	cumulative voting rights.








	In the event the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve a proposal is not obtained at the Meeting,
	the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting with respect to any proposal in accordance
	with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any adjournment of the Meeting will require the affirmative
	vote of the holders of a majority of the fund's shares cast at the Meeting, and any adjournment with respect to any proposal
	will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the proposal cast at the
	Meeting. The persons named as proxies will vote for or against any adjournment in their discretion.










	Abstentions and Broker "Non-Votes."


	Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received
	from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee indicates on the proxy that it does
	not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) are counted as shares entitled to vote at the Meeting in determining
	whether a quorum is present, but do not count as votes cast for a proposal. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes have
	the same effect as a vote "against" a proposal.










	Cost of Preparation and Distribution of Proxy Materials.


	The costs of the preparation of these proxy materials and their distribution will be borne by the funds.










	Solicitation of Proxies.


	In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, proxies may be solicited by telephone, by fax, by e-mail or in person
	by the Trustees, officers and employees of the funds and/or by personnel of the Advisor, its affiliates, or by broker-dealer
	firms. Computershare Inc., which serves as transfer agent, will assist in the solicitation of proxies. Computershare Inc.
	will be reimbursed by the funds for its reasonable expenses.













	Telephone Voting









	In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, by fax, by e-mail or in person, the funds may also arrange to have votes recorded
	by telephone by officers and employees of the funds or by the personnel of the Advisor, the transfer agent or solicitor. The telephone voting procedure
	is designed to verify a shareholder's




	 













	12















	Table of Contents









	identity, to allow a shareholder to authorize the voting of shares in accordance with the shareholder's instructions and to
	confirm that the voting instructions have been properly recorded.




	A shareholder will be called on a recorded line at the telephone number in each fund's account records and will be asked to
	provide certain identifying information.








	The shareholder will then be given an opportunity to authorize proxies to vote his or her shares at the Meeting in accordance
	with the shareholder's instructions.








	Alternatively, a shareholder may call the funds' Voice Response Unit to vote by taking the following steps:





	■



	Read the Proxy Statement and have your proxy card(s) at hand.





	■



	Call the toll-free-number located on your proxy card(s).





	■



	Enter the "control number" found on the front of your proxy card(s).





	■



	Follow recorded instructions to cast your vote.








	With both methods of telephone voting, to ensure that the shareholder's instructions have been recorded correctly, the shareholder
	will also receive a confirmation of the voting instructions. If the shareholder decides after voting by telephone to attend
	the Meeting, the shareholder can revoke the proxy at that time and vote the shares at the Meeting.













	Internet Voting









	Shareholders also will have the opportunity to submit their voting instructions via the Internet by utilizing a program provided
	through a third-party vendor. Voting via the Internet will not affect a shareholder's right to vote in person if the shareholder
	decides to attend the Meeting. A shareholder should not mail the proxy card(s) if he or she is voting via the Internet. To
	vote via the Internet, a shareholder will need the "control number" that appears on the proxy

	card(s). These Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identities, to allow shareholders to give
	their voting instructions and to confirm that shareholders' instructions have been recorded properly. If a shareholder is
	voting via the Internet, he or she should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage
	charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, the costs of which the shareholder must bear.








	To vote via the Internet, a shareholder should:







	■



	Read the Proxy Statement and have your proxy card(s) at hand.






	■



	Go to the Web site on the proxy card(s).





	■



	Enter the "control number" found on the front of your proxy card(s).





	■



	Follow the instructions on the Web site.








	To ensure that the shareholder's instructions have been recorded correctly, the shareholder will receive a confirmation of
	his or her voting instructions immediately after submitting them.













	Shareholders Sharing the Same Address









	As permitted by law, only one copy of this Proxy Statement may be delivered to shareholders residing at the same address,
	unless such shareholders have notified the applicable fund of their desire to receive multiple copies of the shareholder reports
	and other materials that a fund sends. If a shareholder would like to receive an additional copy, he or she should contact
	the applicable fund by writing to 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, Attn: Michael Heffernan, or by calling
	866-859-8682. The fund will then promptly deliver, upon request, a separate copy of this Proxy Statement to any shareholder
	residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Shareholders wishing to receive separate copies of the fund's shareholder
	reports and other materials in the future, and shareholders sharing an address that wish to receive a single copy if they
	are receiving multiple copies, also should send a request as indicated.
















	Other Matters





	The Board does not know of any matters to be presented at the Meeting other than the proposal described in this Proxy Statement.
	If any other matters properly come before the Meeting, the shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with
	the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies.













	SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS










	Shareholder proposals, including Nominees for Trustee, intended to be presented at a fund's 2018 annual meeting, in accordance
	with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, must be received by that fund at its offices at 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts
	02210, by no later than the close of business on August 3, 2017, for inclusion in that fund's proxy statement and form of
	proxy relating to that meeting (subject to certain exceptions). Written notice of a shareholder proposal submitted outside
	of the processes of Rule 14a-8 must be delivered to the Secretary of the relevant fund at 601 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts
	02210 by no later than the close of business on September 1, 2017, and no earlier than August 3, 2017. In order to be included
	in a fund's proxy statement and form of proxy, a shareholder proposal must comply with all applicable legal requirements.
	Timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee that such proposal will be included.

	ATTACHMENT 1











	JOHN HANCOCK FUNDS AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER











	A. Overall Role and Responsibility








	1. Overall Role. The Audit Committee (the "Committee") shall assist the Board of Trustees (collectively, the "Board") of each
	registered investment company in the John Hancock Funds complex

	1

	(collectively, the "Trust") in its oversight role with respect to:








	a. the integrity of the Trust's financial statements;

	b. the financial reporting process;

	c. the system of internal controls over financial reporting;

	d. the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm's (the "Independent Auditor") qualifications and independence;

	e. the performance of the Trusts' Independent Auditor; and

	f. the Trusts' compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to accounting, internal accounting controls or
	auditing matters and related disclosures.








	2. Responsibility of the Committee. The function of the Committee is oversight. Officers of the Trust are responsible for
	financial reporting and maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and internal control over financial reporting. The
	Trust's Independent Auditor is responsible for planning and carrying out an audit in accordance with legal and regulatory
	requirements and the standards of the PCAOB or other similar accounting and auditing standards organization and for providing
	other audit and non-audit services for which it may be engaged by the Trust.








	In fulfilling the Committee's responsibilities hereunder, it is recognized that it is not the duty or responsibility of the
	Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set
	auditor independence standards. Accordingly, the Committee's oversight role does not provide any expert or special assurance
	as to the financial statements and other financial information provided by the Trust to its shareholders and others. The authority
	and responsibilities set forth in this Charter recognize that the Committee members are not acting as accountants or auditors,
	and this Charter does not reflect or create any duty or obligation of the Committee to plan or conduct any audit, to determine
	or certify that the Trust's financial statements are complete, accurate, fairly presented, or in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles or applicable law, or to guarantee the Independent Auditor's report.








	Reliance on Other Persons and Information. Each Committee member shall be entitled to rely on: (i) the integrity of those
	persons and organizations within and outside the Trust from which the Committee receives information; (ii) the accuracy of
	the financial and other information provided to the Committee by such persons and organizations, absent actual knowledge to
	the contrary (which shall be promptly reported to the Board); and (iii) statements made by the officers and employees of the
	Trust, the Trust's investment adviser (the "Adviser"), or other third parties as to any information technology, internal audit
	and other non-audit services provided by the Independent Auditor to the Trust. In addition, the evaluation of the Trust's
	financial statements by the Committee is not of the same scope as, and does not involve the extent of detail as, audits performed
	by the Independent Auditor, nor does the Committee's evaluation substitute for the responsibilities of the Trust's officers
	for preparing, or the Independent Auditor for auditing, the financial statements.












	B. Membership








	1. Number of Committee Members. The Committee shall consist of at least three Trustees of the Trust, none of whom is an "interested
	person" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Trust (an "Independent Trustee").








	2. Appointment of Committee Members. The full Board shall designate the members of the Committee and the Committee Chair.
	Committee members shall serve at the pleasure of the Board.








	3. Qualifications of Committee Members.








	a. Except as otherwise permitted by the applicable rules of the NYSE Arca, each member of the Committee shall be "independent,"
	as defined by such rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.








	b. No Committee member may receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Trust,
	other than fees paid in his or her capacity as a member or Chair of the Board, or of any committee of the Board.

	c. To the extent required by the NYSE, each Committee member must be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted
	by the Board in its business judgment, or must become financially literate within a reasonable period of time after his or
	her appointment to the Committee.








	d. At least one Committee member must have accounting or related financial management expertise, as the Board interprets such
	qualification in its business judgment. The Board may presume that a person who satisfies the definition of "audit committee
	financial expert" (discussed below) has such expertise.








	e. Unless otherwise permitted by the Board, no member of the Committee may serve on the audit committee of more than two other
	public companies (other than another John Hancock fund).








	4. Audit Committee Financial Expert. The Board shall determine annually whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee
	financial expert," as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR. The designation of a person as an "audit committee financial expert,"
	within the meaning of the rules under Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, shall not impose any greater responsibility
	or liability on that person than the responsibility and liability imposed on such person as a Committee member, nor shall
	it decrease the duties and obligations of other Committee members or the Board.












	C. Operations








	1. Meetings and Actions by Written Consent. The Committee shall meet as often as it deems appropriate. Meetings may be called
	and notice given by the Committee Chair or a majority of the Committee members. Committee members may attend meetings in person
	or by telephone. The Committee may act by written consent to the extent permitted by law and the Trust's governing documents.
	The Committee shall maintain minutes or other records of its meetings and activities and report to the Board on any action
	it takes not later than the next following Board meeting.








	2. Delegation to Subcommittees. The Committee may delegate any portion of its authority, including the authority to grant
	preapprovals of audit and permitted non-audit services, to a subcommittee of one or more members.








	3. Appointment of Chair. As noted above, one member of the Committee shall be appointed as Chair by the Board. The Chair shall
	be responsible for leadership of the Committee, including scheduling meetings or reviewing and approving the schedule for
	them, preparing agendas or reviewing and approving them before the meetings, presiding over the meetings, and making reports
	to the Board, as appropriate.








	4. Executive Sessions. The Committee may meet privately and may admit non-members by invitation. The Committee shall meet
	with Officers of the Trust and the Independent Auditor in separate executive sessions as the Committee deems appropriate,
	and may meet with internal legal counsel and compliance personnel of the Adviser and with representatives of the Trust's service
	providers, to discuss matters that relate to the areas for which the Committee has responsibility.








	5. Required Vote and Quorum. The affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Committee participating in any meeting
	of the Committee is necessary for the adoption of any resolution. No resolution may be adopted unless at least 50% of the
	Committee members are present at the meeting in person or by telephone.








	6. Appropriate Resources and Authority. The Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its
	responsibilities, including the authority to retain special counsel and other advisers, experts or consultants, at the Trust's
	expense, as it determines necessary or appropriate to carry out its duties. The Committee shall have direct access to such
	officers of, and service providers to, the Trust, including subadvisers to the Trusts, as it deems desirable.








	7. Review of Charter. The Committee shall review and assess the adequacy of this Charter at least annually and, where necessary,
	will recommend changes to the Board for its approval. The Board may amend this Charter at any time in response to recommendations
	from the Committee or on its own motion.








	8. Performance Evaluation. The Committee shall undertake and review with the Board an annual performance evaluation of the
	Committee. The performance evaluation by the Committee shall be conducted in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate.
	The report to the Board may take the form of an oral report by the Committee Chair or by any other member of the Committee
	or by counsel to the Independent Trustees if designated by the Committee to make this report.












	D. Duties and Powers of the Committee








	To carry out its purposes, the Committee shall:

	The Committee will request the Adviser to establish procedures that are acceptable to the Chief Compliance Officer of the
	Trust (the "CCO") for the anonymous submission of Complaints by employees of the Adviser and its affiliates. Complaints by
	other parties may be submitted to the Committee Chair or to the CCO, who will then forward the Complaint to the Committee
	Chair. The CCO will provide a report to the Committee each quarter regarding Complaints received during the prior quarter.








	The Committee Chair may convene a special meeting of the Committee (which may be telephonic) to review a Complaint or may
	defer review until the next regularly scheduled quarterly Committee meeting. The Committee will evaluate the Complaint, determine the appropriate action
	to be taken in response to the Complaint, and review any action taken by the Adviser and its affiliates to address the Complaint. In evaluating the Complaint,
	the Committee may

	Except as necessary to carry out its duties under this section, the Committee will seek to keep all Complaints and the identity
	of the party submitting the Complaint confidential to the extent reasonably possible.

	Table of Contents











	ANNEX A










	The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited
	to) the criteria set forth below. The Committee may determine that a candidate who does not satisfy these criteria in one
	or more respects should nevertheless be considered as a nominee if the Committee finds that the criteria satisfied by the
	candidate and the candidate's other qualifications demonstrate the appropriate level of fitness to serve.










	General Criteria










	1. Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards, and such other personal
	characteristics as a capacity for leadership and the ability to work well with others.

	2. Nominees should have business, professional, academic, financial, accounting or other experience and qualifications which
	demonstrate that they will make a valuable contribution as Trustees.

	3. Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Funds, and the responsibilities of a trustee/director of an investment
	company and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees.

	4. Nominees should have the ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the
	Funds, including shareholders and the investment adviser, and to act in the interests of all shareholders.

	5. Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair their ability to represent the
	interests of all the shareholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a trustee.

	6. Nominees should have experience on corporate or other institutional bodies having oversight responsibilities.








	It is the intent of the Committee that at least one Independent Trustee be an "audit committee financial expert" as that term
	is defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR.










	Application of Criteria to Current Trustees










	The re-nomination of current Trustees should not be viewed as automatic, but should be based on continuing qualification under
	the criteria set forth above based on, among other things, the current Trustee's contribution to the Board and any committee
	on which he or she serves.










	Review of Nominations










	1. The Committee believes that it is in the best interests of each Trust and its shareholders to obtain highly-qualified candidates
	to serve as members of the Board.








	2. In nominating candidates who would be Independent Trustees, the Committee believes that no particular qualities or skills
	nor any specific minimum qualifications or disqualifications are controlling or paramount. The Committee shall take into consideration
	any such factors as it deems appropriate. These factors may include (but are not limited to) the person's character, integrity,
	judgment, skill, diversity and experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity
	and size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight; the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience
	of other Board members; and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any Committees
	thereof. Other factors that the Committee may take into consideration include a person's availability and commitment to attend
	meetings and perform his or her responsibilities; whether or not the person has or had any relationships that might impair
	or appear to impair his or her independence, such as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund management,
	the investment adviser and/or any subadviser of the Funds, as applicable, Fund service providers, or their affiliates or with
	Fund shareholders. The Committee will strive to achieve a group that reflects a diversity of experiences in respect of industries,
	professions and other experiences, and that is diversified as to gender and race.








	3. While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and recommendation to the Board of Independent Trustee candidates,
	the Committee may consider nominees recommended by any source, including shareholders, management, legal counsel and Board
	members, as it deems appropriate. The Committee may retain a professional search firm or a consultant to assist the Committee
	in a search for a qualified candidate. Any recommendations from shareholders shall be directed to the Secretary of the relevant
	Trust at such address as is set forth in the Trust's disclosure documents. Recommendations from management may be submitted
	to the Committee Chair. All recommendations shall include all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed
	in solicitations of proxies for the election of Board members and as specified in the relevant Trust's By-Laws, and must be
	accompanied by a written consent of the proposed candidate to stand for election if nominated for the Board and to serve if
	elected by shareholders.








	4. Any shareholder nomination must be submitted in compliance with all of the pertinent provisions of Rule 14a-8 under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in order to be considered by the Committee. In evaluating a nominee recommended by a shareholder,
	the Committee, in addition to the criteria discussed above, may consider the objectives of the shareholder in submitting that
	nomination and whether such objectives are consistent with the interests of all shareholders. If the Board determines to include
	a shareholder's candidate among the slate of its designated nominees, the candidate's name will be placed on the Trust's proxy
	card. If the Board determines not to include such candidate among its designated nominees, and the shareholder has satisfied
	the requirements of Rule 14a-8, the shareholder's candidate will be treated as a nominee of the shareholder who originally
	nominated the candidate. In that case, the candidate will not be named on the proxy card distributed with the Trust's proxy
	statement.








	5. As long as a current Independent Trustee continues, in the opinion of the Committee, to satisfy the criteria listed above,
	the Committee generally would favor the re-nomination of a current Trustee rather than a new candidate. Consequently, while the Committee will consider
	nominees recommended by shareholders to serve as trustees, the Committee may only act upon such recommendations if there is a vacancy on the Board,
	or the Committee determines that the selection of a new or additional Trustee is in the best interests of the relevant Trust. In the event that a vacancy
	arises or a change in Board




	 













	24















	Table of Contents









	membership is determined to be advisable, the Committee will, in addition to any shareholder recommendations, consider candidates
	identified by other means as discussed in this Annex A.




	6. With respect to candidates for Independent Trustee, a biography of each candidate shall be acquired and shall be reviewed
	by counsel to the Independent Trustees and counsel to the Trust to determine the candidate's eligibility to serve as an Independent
	Trustee.








	7. The Committee may from time to time establish specific requirements and/or additional factors to be considered for Independent
	Trustee candidates as it deems necessary or appropriate.








	8. After its consideration of relevant factors, the Committee shall present its recommendation(s) to the full Board for its
	consideration.
