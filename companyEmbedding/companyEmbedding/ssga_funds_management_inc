S&P 500 Index
                


The S&P 500® Index is composed of five hundred (500) selected stocks, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans over 25 separate industry groups.














Important Risk Information
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
Passively managed funds invest by sampling the index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.
Companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations. In exchange for this potentially lower risk, the value of the security may not rise as much as companies with smaller market capitalizations.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.

Important Risk Information
Risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions.
Derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal.
Companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions. Larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations. In exchange for this potentially lower risk, the value of the security may not rise as much as companies withsmaller market capitalizations.
The Fund invests by sampling the index, holding a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full Index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics. This may cause the fund to experience tracking errors relative to performance of the index.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007.

ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.

They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.

History[edit]
The asset management division of State Street Bank was founded in 1978 in Boston, Massachusetts. Its first three products were a domestic index fund, an international index fund (based on the MSCI EAFE index), and a short-term investment fund. By 1989 the division had $53 billion (USD) in assets under management.
In 1990 State Street Global Advisors was formed as a separate entity from State Street Bank with the mission of expanding globally. SSGA opened its first global office in London. By 1994 SSGA had offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Toronto, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Dubai, San Francisco, Montreal, and Atlanta. Between 1995 and 1999 five more offices opened in Munich, Zürich, Santiago, Singapore, and Chicago. From 2000 to 2007 SSGA set up operations in Milan, Bangalore and Melbourne.
SSGA invented the investment vehicle known as the exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 1993 with the introduction of the S&P 500 SPDR product (Ticker: NYSE Arca: SPY),[2] which is traded on the American Stock Exchange. SSGA is the number two ETF manager in the world second only to BlackRock.[3]
Assets under management climbed to $161 billion (USD) in 1994 and more than quadrupled to $667 billion by 1999.
Since 2000, SSGA has focused on increasing its client base outside of the United States and developing actively managed investment products. As of 2006, one-third of assets under management were from non-US investors.
In 2003, SSGA's Boston office moved to the newly completed State Street Financial Center building at One Lincoln Street.
SSGA launched the first foreign real estate ETF in 2006 (Ticker: NYSE Arca: RWX),[4] which provides investors in the US an easy way to access the international housing and commercial development markets.
In January 2011, SSGA completed its acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM). The acquisition was first announced in October 2010 for approximately €57 million. The acquisition enhances SSGA’s range of investment management solutions and expands State Street’s overall presence in Ireland where it has been serving institutional clients for 15 years.[5]




Fearless Girl statue in Manhattan's Financial District


For March 2017, State Street Global Advisors commissioned a statue, Fearless Girl by Kristen Visbal, and located it temporarily in the Financial District, Manhattan, in front of the Wall Street icon Charging Bull. The statue is an advertisement for an index fund which comprises gender diverse companies that have a higher percentage of women among their senior leadership.[6] While some have seen it as an encouragement of women in business, some women criticized the statue as "corporate feminism" that violated their own feminist principles.[7][8][9]
Products and services[edit]
SSGA creates customized investment strategies for institutions. SSGA manages the assets for clients by setting up commingled funds (otherwise known as common trust funds).
In addition to institutional products, SSGA has 46 ETF investment products in the US market, as of March 2007. The ETFs track international and domestic indices based on market capitalization, investment style, sector, industry, or commodity. ETF products are also available in other parts of the world such as Belgium, France, Hong Kong, and Singapore under the streetTracks brand.
SSGA has 26 Mutual Fund products divided by investment type: money markets, bonds, equities, and diversified funds of funds (also known as life style funds).
SSGA partners with seven companies in various markets to produce local investment strategies for clients. They are Advanced Investment Partners; Asian Direct Capital Management; GovernanceMetrics International (GMI); Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc.; Rexiter Capital Management Limited; Shott Capital Management, LLC; SSARIS Advisors, LLC; The Tuckerman Group, LLC; and Wilton Asset Management, LLC.
Lawsuits[edit]
In October, 2007, several pension funds sued State Street Corp. for the alleged mishandling of several bond funds managed by SSGA.[10]
In 2008, State Street Bank was sued by Trust Co. for Fixed Income Funds Investment.[11] The case was settled in 2010.
In April 2009, a class action suit was filed against State Street, alleging SSGA chose illiquid, leveraged, and risky securities in their short-term, liquid fund products.[12]

State Street Global Advisors Strengthens Global SPDR Business with Product and Marketing Appointments | Business Wire
























































State Street Global Advisors Strengthens Global SPDR Business with 
      Product and Marketing Appointments






May 02, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the asset management business of 
      State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) today announced two new 
      appointments: Noel Archard has been named head of global SPDR product, 
      and Seth Morrison has been named head of global SPDR marketing. Both 
      will be based in Boston. SSGA is a global leader in exchange traded 
      funds, with $558 billion in ETF assets under management.1



      “Our global SPDR ETF business has a strong track record of product 
      innovation, having introduced the first US listed ETF more than two 
      decades ago, and launched numerous ‘world firsts’ since,” said Rory 
      Tobin, co-head of the global SPDR business. “As our business has 
      expanded and matured, so too have the responsibilities of our product 
      and marketing teams. Both Noel and Seth have strong track records of 
      developing ETF products consistent with client and regulatory 
      requirements. We are delighted to welcome them both to the team, and we 
      look forward to their leadership as we evolve and grow our Global SPDR 
      ETF business.”
    

      In this newly created role, Archard will be responsible for product 
      strategy, innovation, range and lifecycle management for the global SPDR 
      ETF business. He will report in to Cyrus Taraporevala, head of the 
      global institutional group, and Tobin. Archard brings a wealth of 
      knowledge with more than 20 years’ experience in the global asset 
      management industry. Most recently, he was country head of BlackRock in 
      Canada tasked with growing the company across all business lines within 
      this market. Prior to this, Archard held positions at Blackrock and 
      Vanguard, helping to build and establish their ETF programs. He is a 
      graduate of Northwestern University and a CFA Charterholder.
    

      Also in a newly created role, Morrison will be responsible for all 
      marketing activities across the SPDR business in North America, EMEA and 
      APAC. He will report in to Nick Good, co-head of the global SPDR 
      business, and Stephen Tisdalle, chief marketing officer of SSGA. “Both 
      of these new roles demonstrate our commitment to expanding the reach and 
      relevancy of SPDR value-added services and our broad range of ETF 
      investment capabilities to institutional and intermediary clients,” said 
      Good. Additionally Tisdalle commented, “Our ETF business is embracing 
      innovative marketing programs that communicate our perspectives and 
      insights to help investors make informed decisions about their 
      portfolios.”
    

      Morrison joins SSGA from Vanguard where he served as head of Flagship 
      Business Development Group, the high net-worth sales group for their US 
      Retail business. Prior to this, Seth was head of Vanguard’s 
      International Marketing team. Previously, Seth spent more than 10 years 
      at Franklin Templeton where he held multiple global executive roles in 
      marketing and product distribution.

Important Information


      Investing involves risk including the risk of loss of principal.
    

      ETFs trade like stocks, are subject to investment risk, fluctuate in 
      market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETFs net asset 
      value.
    

      Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
    

      In general, ETFs can be expected to move up or down in value with the 
      value of the applicable index. Although ETFs may be bought and sold on 
      the exchange through any brokerage account, ETFs are not individually

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  


1
Overview and Scope  This Code of Ethics (the Code) applies to (i) the employees of and certain
designated contingent workers engaged at State Street Global Advisors, wherever located; (ii) officers of registered investment companies managed by SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (SSGA FM), excluding registered investment companies
for which SSGA FM serves as sub-adviser (the Funds) (such individuals specified in (i) and (ii), collectively Covered Persons); and (iii) any other persons as designated from time to time by the State Street Ethics
Office (the Ethics Office), or their designee. SSGA FM and other advisory affiliates of State Street make up State Street Global Advisors (SSGA), the investment management arm of State Street Corporation (see Appendix A for a
list of SSGA entities and locations). In certain non-US countries, local laws, regulations or customs may impose requirements in addition to those required by the Code. Covered Persons residing in a country identified in Appendix D are subject to
the applicable requirements set forth in Appendix D, as updated from time to time.  Please note that in France the provisions of this Code are
complementary to the provisions of State Street Global Advisors France, S.A.s (SSGAF) Internal Regulation as updated on July 1, 2011, and the other policies and procedures listed in Appendix D. 
The Ethics Office administers this Code in coordination with SSGAs Global Chief Compliance Officer, and should be contacted if you have any questions
concerning the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this Code.   


2
Statement of General Fiduciary Principles  SSGA, its subsidiaries and affiliates (see Appendix A) (collectively
the Advisors, Our, or We) and the officers of the Funds owe a fiduciary duty to their advisory clients (including the Funds) and are subject to certain laws and regulations governing personal securities trading.
Therefore, as a Covered Person, you have an obligation to observe the following principles, as applicable:   


 

 
At all times, avoid placing your personal interest ahead of the interests of the clients of the Advisors;   


 

 
Avoid actual and potential conflicts of interests between personal activities and the activities of the Advisors clients; and 
 


 

 
Do not misappropriate investment opportunities from clients.  As such, your personal financial transactions
and related activities, along with those of your family members (and others in a similar relationship to you) must be conducted consistently with this Code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest with the
Advisors clients or abuse of your position of trust and responsibility. Please see Appendix D for regional requirements concerning applicability of the Code to accounts associated with the Covered Persons. 
When making personal investment decisions you must exercise extreme care to ensure that the prohibitions of this Code are not violated. We have developed this
Code to promote the

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  

highest standards of behavior and ensure compliance with applicable laws. The Code sets forth procedures and limitations that govern the personal securities transactions of every Covered Person.
 It is not possible for this Code to address every situation involving the personal trading of Covered Persons. The Ethics Office is charged with
oversight and interpretation of the Code in a manner considered fair and equitable, in all cases placing the Advisors clients interests as paramount. No Covered Person shall recommend or cause an Advisors client account to take
action or refrain from taking action for the Covered Persons own personal benefit. Technical compliance with the procedures, prohibitions and limitations of the Code will not automatically insulate you from scrutiny of, or sanctions for,
securities transactions that abuse your fiduciary duty to any client of the Advisors. In addition to the detailed rules on personal securities transactions and other issues, the Code sets forth general principles that will apply even if specific
rules do not address a specific situation.

Covered Persons personal bank accounts, government-subsidised (pension)-saving products, savings plans within the course of company pension schemes and educational savings plans which only allow unaffiliated
open-end mutual funds, unit-investment trusts, or other registered commingled funds (such as IRC 529 Plans in the U.S.).   


 

 
Pension accounts established under the Hong Kong regulation or the Singapore regulation unless the account has a capacity to invest in securities that are subject to the preclearance and reporting process.
  


 

 
Retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)s in the United States or superannuation vehicles in Australia) that are only invested in open-end mutual funds, UCITs, SICAVs, unlisted managed investment schemes not advised or
sub-advised by SSGA.  For greater clarity, all Reportable Accounts must be reported in StarCompliance regardless of whether they only
hold securities which are considered exempt under the Code.

current value of an asset and its value at contract time. If the difference is negative, then the buyer pays instead to the seller.

Requirements of the Code Applicable to All Access Persons, Investment Personnel, and Non-Access Persons   


 
A.
Compliance with Applicable Securities Laws  The Advisors are subject to extensive laws
and regulations. As a Covered Person, you must comply not only with all applicable securities laws3, but all applicable firm-wide policies and procedures, including this Code, which may be, on
occasion, more restrictive than applicable securities laws. Any person subject to this Code is responsible for compliance with these rules. Covered Persons residing outside the U.S. must also comply with local securities laws (see Appendix D for
specific country requirements). In addition, Covered Persons must be sensitive to the need to recognize any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, of interest between personal activities and activities conducted for the benefit of the
Advisors clients, whether or not covered by the provisions of this Code.   


 
B.
Prohibited Conduct  No Covered Person, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly
or indirectly, by such Covered Person of a security held or to be acquired by a Fund, shall:   


 
a.
Employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Fund;   


 
b.
Make any untrue statement of a material fact to the Fund or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made to the Fund, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading;   


 
c.
Engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the Fund; or   


 
d.
Engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund.   


 
C.
Adherence to the SSGA Inside Information Policy and the State Street Standard of Conduct 
Covered Persons must adhere to the provisions of the SSGA Inside Information Policy, which governs the receipt and communication of material,
non-public information (inside information) and prohibits the use of such information in violation of securities laws. The SSGA Inside Information Policy states that trading or recommending trading in any security in violation of
securities laws while in possession of material, non-public information (insider trading) is prohibited. It is a violation of the SSGA Inside Information Policy for any Covered Person to engage in insider trading, including: 
 


 

 
trading, either personally or on behalf of others, while in possession of inside information;   


 

 
communicating inside information to any other person (except to a direct manager or person authorized by the SSGA Legal Department to receive such information (a Designated Person) or other Covered Persons
on a need-to-know basis with the prior approval of one of the Designated Persons).; and   


 

 
recommending the purchase or sale of securities to which the inside information relates.   


3 
U.S. employees must comply with the applicable U.S. Federal Securities Laws. This includes the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, any rules adopted by the SEC under these statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act and rules adopted there under by the SEC or the Department of the Treasury.

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  
Inside information may include information about important events involving the Reportable
Funds, such as, but not limited to, planned mergers or liquidations of Reportable Funds, or changes in the portfolio management team for a Reportable Fund. 
Employees must also adhere to the provisions of the State Street Standard of Conduct, which addresses personal trading, inside information, and
protection of confidential information, among other policies.   


 
D.
Reporting Violations  This language does not apply to Covered Persons in France and
Italy. Please see Appendix D for the Reporting Violations section applicable in France and Italy. Covered Persons are required to promptly report any violation of the Code, and any amendments thereto, whether their own or another
individuals, to the Ethics Office. Reports of violations other than your own may be made to the Ethics Office or the senior compliance manager in your region, or the CCO. Alternatively, you may contact the Network to report violations
anonymously and confidentially (see Appendix G for contact information).  State Street recognizes that certain disclosures of confidential
information to appropriate government authorities are protected by whistleblower and other laws. Nothing in this Code of Ethics is intended to or should be understood to prohibit or otherwise discourage such disclosures. State Street
will not tolerate any discipline or other retaliation against employees who properly make such legally-protected disclosures.   


 
E.
Certification of Receipt and Compliance   


 
a.
Initial Certification (New Covered Person)  Each new Covered Person will be given a copy of
this policy and the State Street Standard of Conduct. New employees will be given a copy of the State Street Standard of Conduct. Each new employees offer letter will include a copy of the Code and a statement advising the individual that
he/she will be subject to the Code if he/she accepts the offer of employment. If, outside the U.S. due to local employment practices it is necessary to modify this approach, then the offer letters will be revised in accordance with local law. Within
10 calendar days each new Covered Person must certify that they have (i) read, understand, and will comply with the Code, (ii) will promptly report violations or possible violations (in France and Italy, Covered Persons will acknowledge
they have the possibility to report violations or possible violations identified in the Reporting Violations section set forth in Appendix D as applicable to France and Italy); and (iii) recognize that an instance of non-compliance
with the Code may be grounds for action under the State Street Compliance Enforcement Procedure - Global. Further rules apply to Covered Persons in Italy. Please see section Certification of receipt and Compliance in Appendix D as
applicable to Italy.   


 
b.
Annual Certification (All Covered Persons)  Each Covered Person is required to certify
annually in writing that they have read and understand the Code within 30 calendar days following calendar year

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  

end. Each Covered Person must also certify that they: (i) have complied with the Code during the course of their association with the Advisor; (ii) will continue to comply with the Code
in the future; (iii) will promptly report violations or possible violations (in France and Italy, Covered Persons will acknowledge they have the possibility to report the violations or possible violations identified the Reporting
Violations section set forth in Appendix D as applicable to France and Italy); (iv) recognize that an instance of non-compliance with the Code may be grounds for action under the State Street Compliance Enforcement Procedure - Global.
  


 
F.
Reportable Funds Transactions and Holdings  Covered Persons are subject to the same
policies prohibiting excessive trading that apply to all shareholders in Reportable Funds. These policies, as described in the Reportable Funds prospectuses, are subject to change. 
Excessive trading activity can raise transaction costs for the fund, disrupt the funds stated portfolio management strategy, require a
fund to maintain an elevated cash position, and result in unwanted taxable gains for fund shareholders and reduce the funds long-term performance 
Covered Person investments in Reportable Funds are also subject to the Short Term Trading policy described in Section V. B. of this Code. These
transactions are also subject to the pre-clearance and reporting requirements described in Appendix E.   


 
G.
Disclosure of Reportable Accounts and Holdings  For details on the specific reporting
obligations, see Appendix C.   


 
a.
Initial Report  Each new Covered Person must disclose all Reportable Accounts, and all
holdings in Covered Securities within 10 calendar days of becoming a Non-Access Person, Access Person, or Investment Person. The report must contain information that is current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date the new employee
became an Access Person, Investment Person, or Non-Access Person.  Please note that any Reportable Accounts opened during the Covered
Persons employment or engagement with SSGA must also be immediately disclosed in StarCompliance regardless of whether there is any activity in the account. Any Reportable Accounts newly associated with a Covered Person, through marriage, gift,
inheritance, or any other life event, must be disclosed within 30 days of the event.   


 
b.
Duplicate Statements and Confirms  Each Covered Person is responsible for ensuring that their
broker-dealer, trust account manager, or other entity through which they have a Reportable Account, sends directly to the Ethics Office paper statements and trade confirmations. Designated Brokers (see Appendix F) send electronic feeds to the Ethics
Office. However, it is the responsibility of the Covered Person to 
 








State Street Global Advisors

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  

verify the accuracy of these feeds through Quarterly Transaction Reports and Annual Holdings Reports. This applies to any Reportable Accounts (including Fully Managed Accounts) active during the
Covered Persons employment or engagement with SSGA. In local jurisdictions where this is not standard market practice, the Covered Person shall be responsible for supplying the Ethics Office or their designee(s) with required duplicate
documents. Please see Appendix D for regional requirements.   


 
c.
Quarterly Transaction Reports  Each Covered Person is required to submit a quarterly
transaction report for and certify to transactions in all Covered Securities within 30 calendar days of calendar quarter end, even if they had no transactions in Covered Securities during the quarter. Each Covered Person shall also certify that the
Reportable Accounts listed in the transaction report are the only Reportable Accounts in which Covered Securities were traded during the quarter for their direct or indirect benefit. For the purposes of this report, transactions in Covered
Securities that are effected in Automatic Investment Plans or accounts approved by the Ethics Office as Fully Managed Accounts need not be reported.   


 
d.
Annual Report  On an annual basis, Covered Persons are required to make an annual update of
their Reportable Accounts and all holdings in Covered Securities within 30 calendar days following calendar year end. Each Covered Person shall certify that the accounts and securities listed in the report are the only Reportable Accounts and
Covered Securities in which they have any direct or indirect beneficial ownership and that all details are accurate and correct. The report must contain information that is current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date the report is
submitted.

H.
Excessive Trading  Excessive or inappropriate trading that interferes with job
performance or compromises the duty that the Advisors owe to their clients will not be permitted. An unusually high level of personal trading is strongly discouraged and may be monitored by the Ethics Office and reported to the EMG for review. A
pattern of excessive trading may lead to action under the State Street Compliance Enforcement Procedure - Global.   


 
I.

State Street Gifts and Entertainment Procedure and the gifts and entertainment section of the State Street Standard of Conduct.   


 
J.

comply with the State Street Corporation Political Activities Policy.   


 
K.
Use of the Advisors Proprietary Information  The Advisors investment
recommendations and other proprietary information are for the exclusive use of the Advisors clients. Covered Persons should not use the Advisors proprietary information for personal benefit. Any pattern of personal trading suggesting use
of the Advisors proprietary information will be investigated. Any misuse or distribution in contravention of the Advisors policies regarding confidentiality, proprietary information or the State Street Standard of Conduct is prohibited.

Advisors are required to comply with the business conflicts section of the State Street Standard of Conduct.

options from a prior employer. In those instances, the exercising or selling of options received from the prior employer is subject to the pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code. Please see Appendix D for additional regional
regulations.   


 
N.
Initial Public Offerings  Covered Persons are prohibited from acquiring securities
through an allocation by an underwriter of an initial public offering (IPO). An exception may be considered for situations where the spouse/domestic partner/PACS partner of an Covered Person is eligible to acquire shares in an IPO of
his/her employer with prior written disclosure to and written approval from the Ethics Office. Please see Appendix D for additional regional regulations.   


 
O.

SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  

parties in evaluating the request. To request prior approval, Covered Persons must provide the Ethics Office with a completed Private Placement Request form which is available on the Collaborate
intranet page. See Appendix D for regional definitions of Private Placements.  If the request is approved, the Covered Person must report
the trade on the Quarterly Transaction Report and report the holding on the Annual Holdings Report (see Section IV. H.) Private placements include and are not limited to certain co-operative investments in real estate, commingled investment vehicles
such as hedge funds, investments in family owned businesses, private company shares offered to employees. Time-shares and cooperative investments in real estate used as a primary or secondary residence are not considered to be private placements.
 Covered Persons may not invest in Private Placements if the opportunity to invest in that Private Placement could be considered a favor or
gift designed to influence the Covered Persons judgment in the performance of his/her job duties or as compensation for services rendered to the issuer. In determining whether to grant prior written approval for any investment in a private
placement, the Ethics Office will consider, among other things, whether it would be possible (and appropriate) to reserve that investment opportunity for one or more of Advisors clients, as well as whether the opportunity to invest in the
Private Placement has been offered to the Covered Person as a gift, or as compensation for services rendered.   


 
P.
Investment Clubs and Investment Contests  Covered Persons must obtain prior written
approval from the Ethics Office before participating in an Investment Club. The brokerage account(s) of the Investment Club are subject to the pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code. Participation in an Investment Club with other SSGA
employees requires special review and pre-approval by the Ethics Office. The Advisors prohibit Covered Persons from direct or indirect participation in an investment contest. These prohibitions extend to the direct or indirect acceptance of payment
or offers of payments of compensation, gifts, prizes, or winnings as a result of participation in such activities   


 
Q.
Shorting of Securities  Covered Persons are prohibited from selling securities short.
Please see Appendix D for additional regional regulations.   


 
R.
State Street Securities  Certain employees of the Advisors are subject to the
State Street Securities Trading Policy as administered by the State Street Corporate Legal Department. These employees must comply with this policy. 
During certain trading windows, employees may be permitted to exercise Employee Incentive Awards without being subject to the blackout and open
order rule. However, these transactions remain subject to the pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code at all times. Employees will be notified when a trading window commences. During this period, all employees remain subject to the SSGA
Inside Information Policy, as well as the Personal Trading in Securities section of the State Street Standard of Conduct.

Trading Provisions, Restrictions, and Prohibitions Applicable to Access Persons and Investment Personnel   


 
A.
Pre-Clearance  Access Persons and Investment Personnel must request and receive
pre-clearance approval prior to effecting a personal transaction in all Covered Securities (see Appendix E). All pre-clearance requests must be made by submitting a Pre-Trade Authorization Form (PTAF) for the amount of shares to be
transacted in StarCompliance.  Pre-clearance approval is valid for the same business day the approval is granted.
Good-till-cancelled orders are not permitted.  Access Persons and Investment Persons are required to pre-clear donations and/or
gifts of securities made.  Any pre-clearance request may be evaluated to determine compliance with the provisions of the Code relevant to
the trade, or as market conditions warrant. As there could be many reasons for pre-clearance being granted or denied, Access Persons and Investment Persons should not infer from the pre-clearance response anything regarding the security for which
pre-clearance was requested.  To manage potential conflicts of interest, the Ethics Office maintains a list of issuers whose securities
(including options and futures) may not be traded by anyone subject to this policy. The Restricted List is integrated into the pre-clearance approval process.A security that you already own could be placed on the Restricted List at any time. If this
happens, you will be unable to sell the security until it is removed from the Restricted List.  The contents of the Restricted List shall
be considered inside information and is subject to the considerations of the Inside Information Policy.  By seeking pre-clearance, Access
Persons and Investment Personnel will be deemed to be advising the Ethics Office or their designee(s) that they (i) do not possess any material, non-public information relating to the security or issuer of the security; (ii) are not using
knowledge of any proposed trade or investment program relating to any client portfolio for personal benefit; (iii) believe the proposed trade is available to any similarly situated market participant on the same terms; and (iv) will
provide any relevant information requested by the Ethics Office or their designee(s).  De Minimis Exception 
Transactions effected pursuant to the de minimis exception remain subject to the pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code;
however, they are automatically pre-approved due to their size. A de minimis transaction is a personal trade that meets one of the following conditions: A single transaction in a security with a value equal to or less than US $5,000 (or
the local country equivalent) or multiple transactions in a security within a five business day window that have an aggregate value equal to or less than US $5,000. (See examples on page 16.)

 For fundamental strategies, if a Portfolio Manager receives pre-clearance authorization to trade a Covered Security that requires
pre-clearance in his or her Reportable Account, and subsequently determines that it is appropriate to trade the same or equivalent security in his or her client portfolio, the Portfolio Manager must contact the Ethics Office prior to executing any
trades for his or her Reportable Account and/or client portfolio.

Administration and Enforcement of the Code of Ethics   


 
A.
Applicability of the Code of Ethics Provisions  The Ethics Office, or its
designee(s), has the discretion to determine that the provisions of the Code of Ethics policy do not apply to a specific transaction or activity and may exempt any transaction from one or more trading prohibitions in writing under limited
circumstances if the transaction is not inconsistent with the purpose of the Code and does not amount to a waiver of a fundamental policy contained in the Code that has been adopted to meet applicable securities laws and applicable firm-wide
policies and procedures. The Ethics Office, or its designee(s), will review applicable facts and circumstances of such situations, such as specific legal requirements, contractual obligations or financial hardship. Any Covered Person who would like
such consideration must submit a request in writing to the Ethics Office.   


 
B.

Covered Persons. Covered Persons and their supervisors may or may not be notified of the Ethics Offices review.

Appendix B  Beneficial Ownership 
The Code states that the Codes provisions apply to accounts beneficially owned by the Covered Person, as well as accounts under direct or indirect
influence or control of the Covered Person. Generally, an individual is considered to be a beneficial owner of accounts or securities when the individual has or shares direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the accounts or securities. Pecuniary
interest means that an individual has the ability to profit, directly or indirectly, or share in any profit from a transaction. Indirect pecuniary interest extends to, but is not limited to: 
 


 

 
Accounts and securities held by immediate family members sharing the same household; and   


 

 
Securities held in trust (certain restrictions may apply)   


 

 
A right to acquire Covered Securities through the exercise or conversion of any derivative security, whether or not presently exercisable 
In addition, a Covered Person may be considered a beneficial owner of an account or securities when the Covered Person can exercise direct or indirect
investment control.  Practical Application  If an adult
child is living with his or her parents: If the child is living in the parents house, but does not financially support the parent, the parents accounts and securities are not beneficially owned by the child. If the child works for
the Advisors and does not financially support the parents, accounts and securities owned by the parents are not subject to the Code, with the exception of UGMA/UTMA, or similar types of accounts, which are legally owned by the child. If one or both
parents work for the Advisors, and the child is supported by the parent(s), the childs accounts and securities are subject to the Code because the parent(s) is a beneficial owner of the childs accounts and securities. 
Co-habitation (domestic partnership or PACS): Accounts where the Covered Person is a joint owner, or listed as a beneficiary, are subject to the Code.
If the Covered Person contributes to the maintenance of the household and the financial support of the partner, the partners accounts and securities are beneficially owned by the Covered Person and are therefore subject to the Code. 
Co-habitation (roommate): Generally, roommates are presumed to be temporary and have no beneficial interest in one anothers accounts and
securities.  UGMA/UTMA and similar types of accounts: If the Covered Person, or the Covered Persons spouse is the custodian for a minor
child, the account is beneficially owned by the Covered Person. If someone other than the Covered Person, or the Covered Persons spouse, is the custodian for the Covered Persons minor child, the account is not beneficially owned by the
Covered Person.

Code of Ethics
  
SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  
Transfer On Death accounts (TOD accounts): TOD accounts where the Covered Person receives
the interest of the account upon death of the account owner are not beneficially owned by the Covered Person until the account transfer occurs (this particular account registration is not common). 
Trusts   


 

 
If the Covered Person is the trustee for an account where the beneficiaries are not immediate family members, the position should be reviewed in light of outside business activity and generally will be subject to a
case-by-case review for Code applicability.   


 

 
If the Covered Person is a beneficiary and does not share investment control with a trustee, the Covered Person is not a beneficial owner until the Trust assets are distributed. 
 


 

 
If a Covered Person is a beneficiary and can make investment decisions without consultation with a trustee, the trust is beneficially owned by the Covered Person. 
 


 

 
If the Covered Person is a trustee and a beneficiary, the trust is beneficially owned by the Covered Person.   


 

 
If the Covered Person is a trustee, and a family member is beneficiary, then the account is beneficially owned by the Covered Person. 
 


 

 
If the Covered Person is a settler of a revocable trust, the trust is beneficially owned by the Covered Person.   


 

 
If the Covered Persons spouse/domestic partner is trustee and beneficiary, a case-by-case review will be performed to determine applicability of the Code. 
College age children: If a Covered Person has a child in college and still claims the child as a dependent for tax purposes, the Covered Person is a
beneficial owner of the childs accounts and securities.  Powers of Attorney: If a Covered Person has been granted power of attorney over an
account, the Covered Person is not the beneficial owner of the account until such time as the power of attorney is activated.

Appendix D  Specific Country Requirements 
(For Covered Persons located in offices outside of the U.S.) 
Australia  From time to time the Responsible Entity
(RE) of the Australian domiciled Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may determine certain Covered Persons could be in possession of material, non-public information relating to one or more ETFs for which State Street Global Advisors,
Australia, Limited is the investment advisor, and request a blackout period covering the securities be implemented, whether due to consideration of Australian Securities Exchange listing rules, the insider trading provisions of the Corporations Act
2001 or similar. Typically this may occur during the two weeks prior to the public announcement of income distributions for an ETF.  Upon receipt of a
request from the RE, the Ethics Office, or their designee, will review the request and may initiate a blackout period over the relevant ETFs on such terms as are deemed appropriate. Covered Persons to whom a blackout period applies will be advised
of the commencement, duration and other specifics of any such blackout period. Any trading in contravention of the blackout period will be treated as an instance of non-compliance with this Code. 
United Kingdom  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
(FCA) rules on personal account dealing are contained in the FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS).  Under COBS, any of the
Advisors based in the U.K. must take reasonable steps to ensure that any investment activities conducted by Covered Persons do not conflict with the Advisors duties to its customers. In ensuring this is, and continues to be, the case, the
Advisors must ensure they have in place processes and procedures which enable them to identify and record any Covered Person transactions and permission to continue with any transaction is only given where the requirements of COBS are met. 
France  At the date of this Code, Covered Persons of SSGAF are
required in France to comply, in addition to the Code, with the following provisions:  1. Laws and regulations 
 


 

 
the Monetary and Financial Code, and in the particular the rules of good conduct provided in Articles L.533-10 of of the Monetary and Financial Code;

Further, as indicated in the Code, certain sections of the Code are not applicable in France, or are applicable in a modified version set forth below.
References are to section headings used in the Code.  3. Definitions 
O. Private Placement: In France, a Private Placement means a securities offering that is exempt from registration or which is not subject to the obligation to
publish a prospectus under certain relevant provisions of French law and regulation and/or similar laws of jurisdictions outside of France (if you are unsure whether the securities are issued in a private placement, you must consult with the Ethics
Office). In France, the rules relating to Private Placements are set forth in Articles L.411-2 and D.411-1 et seq. of the Monetary and Financial Code. 
4. Requirements of the Code Applicable to all Access Persons, Investment Personnel, and Non-Access Persons 
In France, the requirements of the Code shall not apply to personal transactions entered into under a Discretionary Account management service where there is
no prior communication in connection with the transaction between the portfolio manager and the Covered Person.  E. Reporting Violations 
If a Covered Person in France has reason to believe that a violation of law or regulations relating to internal control procedures in the financial,
accounting, banking or anti-corruption areas or that a violation of an interest vital to SSGAF or of the physical or moral integrity of its Covered Persons has been committed, he/she is encouraged to notify the Ethics Office so that SSGAF may
carefully examine the facts and take corrective measures.  Covered Persons should identify themselves in order to allow SSGAF to obtain a complete report
on the relevant facts as rapidly as possible. Nonetheless, if circumstances require, Covered Persons may communicate the facts anonymously.  The
information furnished to the company by a Covered Person believing in good faith that his/her action is necessary to protect SSGAF from illegal or inappropriate behavior will be treated in a strictly confidential and secure manner to the extent
allowed by law. Any person identified within the framework of the procedure for reporting violations will have a right to access, obtain further information, and if applicable, object to and correct the data regarding him/her.

A preliminary meeting will be held during which the facts relating to the employees alleged misconduct will be presented to the employee and to the person assisting the employee and at which the employees
explanations will be obtained.   


 

 
As the case may be depending on the explanations given, a sanction letter will be sent by registered post, return receipt requested, at the earliest one full day and at the latest one month after the meeting. This
letter should set forth the grounds for the sanction.  When the behavior of an employee renders such actions indispensable, conservatory
measures may be taken prior to implementing the procedure described above. No sanction may be taken until the procedure has been completed.  The following
additional sections are added to Part 7 of the Code in regard to the Codes administration and enforcement in France:  F. Personal Data 
In France, data obtained in the context of the administration and enforcement of the Code will be processed in compliance with the Computers and Personal
Freedom Act of January 6, 1978, as modified by the Law of August 6, 2004. Pursuant to this law, Covered Persons have access, rectification and objection rights in regard to the data relating to them. They may exercise these rights by
contacting the SSGAF Compliance Department. The Ethics Office will be notified of any Covered Persons who invoke the objection rights to provide broker statements to their local Compliance Department. 
Certain recipients of personal data are located outside of the EU, in particular the following recipients: SSGA Compliance, Boston, MA, and StarCompliance
Software, Inc., Rockville, MD, United States of America. The following data will be communicated to such recipients: Covered Persons name, business phone number, business email address, name of brokerage firm, account number, name and amount
of securities held in brokerage account. StarCompliance Software, Inc. has obtained and maintains a US-EU Safe Harbor Certification with respect to data protection. The transmission of data to recipients located outside of the EU will be made for

Appendix C- Reporting Obligations 
A. Duplicate Statements and Confirmations  Each Covered Person in
France is responsible for sending to the Ethics Office duplicate securities account statements and duplicate trade confirmations summarizing each transaction, including any Reportable Accounts opened during employment or engagement at SSGAF-
specifically:   


 

 
a trade confirmation summarizing each transaction; and   


 

 
account statements (e.g. monthly, quarterly statements).  This requirement applies to all Reportable Accounts
in which a Covered Person has direct or indirect Beneficial Ownership.  Germany 
The German rules on personal account dealing are contained in the Securities Trading Act and specified in more detail by the BaFin circular 4/2010 (WA) MaComp
Minimum Requirements for the Compliance Function and Additional Requirements Governing Rules of Conduct, Organisation and Transparency pursuant to Sections 31 et seq. of the Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz - WpHG) for
Investment Services Enterprises.  The aforementioned rules cover   


 

 
persons who provide investment services directly themselves, as well as all persons who assist these employees by performing both support activities and subsequent control activities. Support functions are regularly
performed in particular by research department, compliance department, back office, or IT support staff, assistants, or members of other support areas in an investment services enterprise. Staff members shall be regarded as employees and freelance
workers as well as agency workers, temporary staff and interns/trainees at an enterprise;   


 

 
persons who perform these activities without being employees of an investment services enterprise if they work for an enterprise to which activities or processes have been outsourced; and 
 


 

 
those employees whose activities may give rise to conflicts of interest or who have access to inside information or other confidential information. 
In general, investment services enterprises shall use adequate resources and procedures that are suitable for preventing unlawful personal account dealing of
employees. Enterprises are individually responsible for determining which of the employees covered perform activities that could give rise to conflicts of interest or which employees have access to compliance-relevant information by virtue of their
activities. Management shall name a unit or the units in the enterprise that is/are entrusted with identifying and regularly monitoring the employees covered. Enterprises are also obliged to maintain an organisational structure that ensures that
this unit is regularly informed of the existence of conflicts of interest and of inside and other confidential information within the enterprise.

SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  
Enterprises shall use risk criteria to assess which areas and persons to include; for example, the volume of
information available to investment advisers or tied agents may determine whether they are included.  F. Personal Data 
In Germany, data obtained in the context of the administration and enforcement of the Code will be processed in compliance with the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz
BDSG. In particular, section 32 applies in this context (data collection, processing and use for employment-related purposes). Employees personal data may be collected, processed or used to investigate crimes only if there is a documented
reason to believe the data subject has committed a crime while employed, the collection, processing or use of such data is necessary to investigate the crime, and the employee does not have an overriding legitimate interest in ruling out the
possibility of collection, processing or use, and in particular the type and extent are not disproportionate to the reason.  Switzerland 
F. Personal Data  In Switzerland, personal data may only be
processed lawfully. Its processing must be carried out in good faith and must be proportionate. Personal data may only be processed for the purpose indicated at the time of collection, that is evident from the circumstances, or that is provided for
by law. The collection of personal data and in particular the purpose of its processing must be evident to the data subject. If the consent of the data subject is required for the processing of personal data, such consent is valid only if given
voluntarily on the provision of adequate information. Additionally, consent must be given expressly in the case of processing of sensitive personal data or personality profiles.

Italy  At the
date of this Code, SSGAs Covered Persons are required in Italy to comply, in addition to the Code, with the following provisions:  Laws and
regulations   


 

 
Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998, as amended (the Italian Financial Act), containing, inter alia, general provisions concerning investment services; 
 


 

 
Legislative Decree No. 231 of 21 November 2007, as amended (the Anti-money Laundering Act), containing, inter alia, the duty to identify each client and subsequently record his data, as well as to
keep a unified electronic archive and to notify any suspect transactions;   


 

 
Regulation No.16190 of 29 October 2007, adopted by CONSOB (the Intermediaries Regulation), with reference to the investment services and the financial activities carried out in Italy; 
 


 

 
instructions containing information duties and statistical reporting requirements, recommendations and decisions issued as the case may be by any Italian supervisory authorities, including CONSOB and the Bank of Italy.
 Further, as indicated in the Code, certain sections of the Code are not applicable in Italy, or are applicable in a modified version set
forth below. References are to section headings used in the Code.  2. Statement of General Fiduciary Principles 
Please note that in Italy, the Code does not necessarily apply to transactions of family members or persons in a similar relationship to you. Rather, the Code
applies to your personal transactions and related activities, and any transactions of which you are a direct or indirect beneficiary.  In this regard,
please also see this Appendix D  Italy  III. Definitions  A. Categories of Employees  Covered Person.  3. Definitions 
A. Categories of Employees - Covered Person: In Italy, a Covered Person includes employees of the Advisors, including full-time and part-time, exempt and
non-exempt employees (where applicable), and other such persons as designated by the Ethics Office. Covered Person also includes certain designated contingent workers engaged at SSGA, including but not limited to consultants, contractors, and
temporary help. Covered Persons are subject to the provisions of this Code. Persons related to an employee or a contingent worker, such as spouses, children and other relatives living in the employees or the contingent workers household
are not covered by the Code, except to the extent the employee or the contingent worker is a direct or indirect beneficiary of transactions entered into by such persons.

O. Private Placement: In Italy, a Private Placement means a securities offering that is exempt from
registration or which is not subject to the obligation to publish a prospectus under certain relevant provisions of Italian law and regulation and/or similar laws of jurisdictions outside of Italy (if you are unsure whether the securities are issued
in a private placement, you must consult with the Ethics Office). In Italy, the rules relating to Private Placements are set forth in Article 100 of the Italian Financial Act, as implemented by CONSOB. 
4. Requirements of the Code Applicable to all Access Persons, Investment Personnel, and Non-Access Persons 
C. Reporting Violations  If a Covered Person in Italy has reason
to believe that a violation of law or regulations relating to internal control procedures in the financial, accounting, banking or anti-corruption areas or that an instance of non-compliance of an interest vital to SSGA or of the physical or moral
integrity of its Covered Persons has been committed, he/she is encouraged to notify the Ethics Office so that SSGA may carefully examine the facts and the Ethics Office may take corrective measures. 
Covered Persons should identify themselves in order to allow SSGA to obtain a complete report on the relevant facts as rapidly as possible. Nonetheless, if
circumstances require, Covered Persons may communicate the facts anonymously.  The Italian branch of SSGA will not take any sanctions or retaliatory
measures against a Covered Person for reporting suspected instances of non-compliance in good faith. Failure to report will not give rise to any consequences for employees. However, an abusive use of the reporting procedure may in certain cases
expose a Covered Person to sanctions.  D. Certification of Receipt and Compliance 
With reference to Italy, further to the provisions set forth under the Code, the following shall apply. 
The Code is displayed on the premises of the Italian branch of SSGA and constitutes an integral part of its disciplinary code. 
7. Administration and Enforcement of the Code of Ethics 
C. Violations and Sanctions  The requirements of this Code have a
binding value vis-à-vis the Covered Persons of the Italian branch of SSGA and are to be considered in addition to the provisions contained in the disciplinary code in force within the Italian branch of SSGA. 
Any potential violation of the provisions of the Code or related policies by Covered Persons in Italy will be investigated by the Ethics Office. Violations of
the Code are reported to the EMG. If a determination is made that an instance of non-compliance has occurred, a sanction may be imposed in accordance with the State Street Compliance Enforcement Procedure - Global and pursuant to the rules
established by Italian Law and by the applicable national collective bargaining agreement.

SSGACOE_Nov2015_1  
As discussed in the State Street Compliance Enforcement Procedure- Global, enforcement shall be
differentiated and graduated based on the seriousness of the individual breaches, taking into consideration the objective circumstances, the intentionality, the existence of justifications, the recidivism and the possible repetition of the conducts
concerned.  Enforcement may also apply to any supervisor who directs or approves such actions, or has knowledge of them and does not promptly correct
them. Conduct which violates this Code may also violate laws and therefore subject the offending Covered Person to civil and criminal liabilities as well. 
SSGA may also be subject to prosecution and fines for the conduct of its employees. Reimbursement of losses of damages deriving from any breach of this Code
will be requested to the employees according to the procedures set forth by the applicable national collective bargaining agreement.  In Italy, prior to
inflict to employee any sanction deriving from possible violations of this Code, the specific disciplinary procedure provided for by Law. No. 300/1970 (the so called Workers Statute) shall be implemented. 
In particular, the Ethics Office shall notify in writing to the employee concerned the facts relating to the alleged misconduct and shall ask the employee
concerned to furnish his/her justifications within 5 days from the receipt of such disciplinary letter.  The disciplinary sanction, if any, shall be
adopted following the 5-days term granted to the employee to render his/her justifications.  The disciplinary sanctions shall be proportional to the
employees behaviour in breach.  F. Personal Data  In
Italy the personal data of the Covered Persons shall be processed in compliance with Legislative Decree n. 196 of 30 June 2003, concerning personal data protection. 
Pursuant to Covered Persons have access, rectification and objection rights in regard to the data relating to them. They may exercise these rights by
contacting the Ethics Office. The Ethics Office will be notified of any Covered Persons who invoke the objection rights to provide broker statements to their local Compliance Department. 
Certain recipients of personal data are located outside of the EU, in particular the following recipients: SSGA Compliance, Boston, MA, and StarCompliance
Software, Inc., Rockville, MD, United States of America. The following data will be communicated to such recipients: Covered Persons name, business phone number, business email address, name of brokerage firm, account number, name and amount
of securities held in brokerage account. StarCompliance Software, Inc. has obtained and maintains a US-EU Safe Harbor Certification with respect to data protection. The transmission of data to recipients located outside of the EU will be made for
the purpose of implementing and coordinating the rules contemplated by this Code.
