BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 01/20/2017
            

                BBB has determined that Summers, Carroll, Whisler, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

 Accounting Services for Financial Institutions
Certified Opinion AuditsA clean, unmodified opinion is the outcome you want for your financial statements.  But meeting regulatory requirements isn't the only goal; in fact, with Summers, Carroll, Whisler LLC it's just the beginning.We understand your business and the risks inherent in accounting and financial statements reporting.  For better protection, we have a tailored process that gives us an understanding of the unique aspects of your financial institution's business.  Financial institutions are not best served by "cookie cutter" solutions, and we won't treat your business that way.Our recommendations are based on extensive experience, and cover:PerformanceInternal ControlsFinancial ReportingManagement MonitoringOperational ControlsOur audits are hands-on, and phone support is available throughout the year to help you operate at your very best.  We also provide an analysis that includes your financial overview, graphical analysis, recommendations, and updates to keep you a step ahead in the industry landscape.Supervisory Committee AuditsWhen a certified audit is not required, there are still minimum regulatory requirements that must be met.  But in fact, it's trickier than that.  Appendix A of NCUA's Supervisory Committee Guide states:"NCUA is not representing that a Supervisory Committee which performs or has performed these minimum procedures, and these procedures only, will have fully met the requirements of Part 715.  The Committee remains responsible to ensure that a complete set of procedures is performed."The responsibility - and risk - still falls on you.  In such an environment, you need confidence that you are meeting all standards that apply to your unique situation.  Summers, Carroll, Whisler LLC is the expert partner who will give you that assurance.ComplianceKeeping abreast of regulatory compliance issues is more daunting than ever.  Compliance covers all areas of your institution's operations, and the regulations are constantly changing.  A regular review and assessment is simply a must in this environment.At Summers, Carroll, Whisler LLC, we have tailored our wide range of compliance services to the other great challenge that is present in your institution - time.With all the demands and time restraints on your staff, we have found it is often easier to break down compliance into smaller areas.  Doing so gives your staff time to develop a plan to correct any deficiencies found - in addition to doing their "regular" jobs - before moving on to the next compliance area.
