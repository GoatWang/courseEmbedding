(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7-MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto.  Forward-Looking Statements  This annual report contains forward-looking statements relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. When used in this Report, the words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "plan" and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management's current view of us concerning future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among many others: our potential inability to raise additional capital, the possibility that third parties hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing our products, the emergence of additional competing technologies, changes in domestic and foreign laws, regulations and taxes, changes in economic conditions, uncertainties related to China's legal system and economic, political and social events in China, a general economic downturn, a downturn in the securities markets, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations which affect trading in the securities of "penny stocks," and other risks and uncertainties. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Report as anticipated, estimated or expected.  Use of Certain Defined Terms  Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this report to "CAME" "we," "us," or "our" and the "Company" are references to the business of ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Company.  Use of GAAP Financial Measures  We use GAAP financial measures in the section of this quarterly report captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation." All of the GAAP financial measures used by us in this report relate to the inclusion of financial information.  Overview  This subsection of MD&A is an overview of the important factors that management focuses on in evaluating our businesses, financial condition and operating performance, our overall business strategy and our earnings for the periods covered.  General  ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Co., formally known as Court Document Services, Inc., is an operating company that is focusing its efforts in movie projects, including pre-production research and strategizing, introduction of American talent and potential partners from Hollywood, California. We are seeking to provide training and global market consulting, production and post-production activities, and particularly the distribution and promotion in the United States market. We have an operating history and have generated revenues that have produced both net incomes and losses in the periods in which we have been fully operational. We are currently in discussion with parties to begin pre-production on a project utilizing facilities that are already in production mode.  We are looking to establish a CAME presence in Hengdian, China which is deemed to be the "Hollywood of China". Our President is working to secure a new location in Building 12, 2/F, Hengdian Industrial Park for Movie and TV Businesses, Hengdian, Zhejiang Province, China. Mr. Fan travels in various parts China extensively for both business and pleasure and has been working on securing the new location.  Our Board of Directors believes that we can operate as a Movie, Entertainment, Media and Documentary production company during the next twelve months to increase revenues for the company. However, the production of a movie, documentary or animated film may take years to complete and future cash flows, if any, are impossible to predict at this time. The value of any revenue and potential profits from any production or animated film is largely dependent on factors beyond our control such as the market for our films.  We may raise cash from sources other than our operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investment by others in the Company.  Subsequent Events - New Business  On December 23, 2013, ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Co and AF Ocean Investment Management (Shanghai) Co., LTD., entered into a management agreement.  -16-  Quick Link to Table of Contents  Shanghai a management fee for the collection and maintenance of the funds received in the People's Republic of China for ChinAmerica.  On December 31, 2013 ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Co received a Twenty Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($20,500 USD) referral fee for the negotiations between ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Co and Zhong Mei Yin Shi.  On January 3, 2014, ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Co. announced that it has finalized the formal contract with Zhong Mei An Di Yin Shi Wen Hua Chuan Mei Ltd., Co. (hereinafter referred to as "Zhong Mei Yin Shi"), a Chinese company registered in Beijing, People's Republic of China, for joint movie projects in both China and the United States. Zhong Mei Yin Shi agrees to pay a total of $1,000,000 (One Million USD) to ChinAmerica Andy Movie Entertainment Media Company ("ChinAmerica").  As of January 28, 2014, payments totaling Three Hundred Thirty Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($330,600 USD) have been received though AF Ocean Investment Management (Shanghai) Co., LTD. The funds were deposited into the AF Ocean Shanghai bank account for the benefit of ChinAmerica under our management agreement.  Employees  As of December 31, 2013, there were no paid employees. This includes our Officers and Director who run the corporation.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. To be as accurate with our estimates as possible, we use our historical data to forecast our future results. Deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis. This allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business. It also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates.  Management does not believe that our actual results are related to any sensitivity in estimates made by management. The year-end consistency of our results has shown that our prior year's historical data is the best projector of our future results.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Financial Interpretation ("FIN") 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes) which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes). FIN 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.  Results of Operations  General  -17-  Quick Link to Table of Contents  Summary of results of operations is as follows:  The following tables set forth key components of our results of operations and revenue for the periods indicated in dollars.  Table 2.0 Comparison of our Statement of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012   For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 %Change Revenue: $ - $ - 0% Expenses: $ (49,534) $ 14,380 100% Income (loss) from operations $ 18 $ (14,380) (100)% Income (loss) from discontinued $ - $ (1,838) (100)% operations Net income (loss) $ (49,516) $ (16,218) (79)% Income (loss) per share: basic and $ (0.00) $ (0.01) - diluted  Income from Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had no operational revenue. We showed a loss from operations while we continue to focus on developing operations in the People's Republic of China.  Operating Expenses. Expenses were $49,534 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $14,380 for the year ended December 31, 2012. This difference is primarily due to a change in operations and all expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 were attributable to discontinued operations. Our current expenses are directly attributable to our professional expenses for legal and accounting services. Management believes that our expenses have remained constant relative to the level of expenditures while we continue to concentrate our efforts on developing operations in the People's Republic of China.  Net Income (Loss). As a result of the factors described above, we show a net loss of $(49,516) for the year ended December 31, 2013. We believe the loss from operations is related to the company developing an operational business in the People's Republic of China. In addition, we have entered into discussions for a new location in Hengdian Industrial Park for Movie and TV Businesses, Hengdian, Zhejiang Province, China. Management believes that with the new contract agreement between CAME and "Zhong Mei Yin Shi" we will begin to see an increase in expenses therefore will continue to see a net loss in the next fiscal year.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  General. As of December 31, 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of $286,383, which was an increase of $282,742. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, which have been discontinued. Our cash requirements are generally for general and administrative activities. We have raised capital through officer loans during the current fiscal year. We believe that our cash balance is sufficient to finance our cash requirements for expected operational activities, capital improvements and partial repayment of debt through the next 12 months. On October 11, 2013, the Company changed direction to the current concentration of Movies, Documentaries and Films.  Our operating activities used cash of $28,258 for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $20,163 for the year ended December 31, 2012. We received additional funding through loans from the Majority Shareholder. Prior to the end of our fiscal year 2013 the majority of the loans we received from our President and sole Director were converted to Equity in the Company.  Cash generated in our financing activities was $311,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to $23,000 during the comparable period in 2012. There was a total of $11,616 in loans from the Majority Shareholder for the year ended December 31, 2013 which will be converted into equity in the first fiscal quarter of 2014. The Company converted a loan in the amount of $100,000 and issued stock to the Majority Shareholder at the par value of $.001.  As of December 31, 2013, current assets exceeded current liabilities.  Going Concern  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no sales and a net loss of ($49,516) for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to net loss of ($16,218) for the year ended December 31, 2012. These factors raise doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company has retained its first client as of January 3, 2014.  Inflation  Inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations.  -18-  Quick Link to Table of Contents  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles. The Company does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company's reported financial position or operations in the near term, other than the following as reported in our financial statements:  Share-based Compensation  The Company may issue stock options whereby all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). The Company had no common stock options or common stock equivalents granted or outstanding for all periods presented.  The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition provisions ASC Topic 505-50. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The Company may issue restricted stock for various business and administrative services. Cost for these transactions are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the common stock is measured at the earlier of (i) the date at which a firm commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached or (ii) the date at which the counterparty's performance is complete.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance arrangements.  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance regarding Accounting Standards Codification 926 (ASC 926) to address topics related to the film entertainment industry. As modern films today can cost and return revenues in the millions of dollars, each one needs to be accounted for with care. Further, as there are a multitude of ways films are distributed today, different rules may apply as to when revenue may be recognized for each.  The Company may enter into arrangements with third parties to co-produce many of its theatrical productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. The parties to these arrangements could include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. The Filmed Entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the respective third-party investor's interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 926 "Entertainment-Films" ("ASC 926"), the estimate of a third-party investor's interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues as provided below:  Unamortized film costs shall be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film may be less than its unamortized costs. The following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that an entity shall assess whether the fair value of a film (whether completed or not) is less than its unamortized film costs:  ·  An adverse change in the expected performance of a film prior to release  ·  Actual costs substantially in excess of budgeted costs  ·  Substantial delays in completion or release schedules  ·  Changes in release plans, such as a reduction in the initial release pattern  ·  Insufficient funding or resources to complete the film and to market it effectively  ·  Actual performance subsequent to release failing to meet that which had been expected prior to release.  -19-  Quick Link to Table of Contents  ASC p. 926- 20-35-12 (transition date:December 15)(transition date:2013).
