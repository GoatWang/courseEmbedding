About Us

Our Maternal-Fetal Medicine physicians are board certified in both Obstetrics and Gynecology and/or are active candidates for certification in Maternal-Fetal Medicine by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG).







Our Skilled Maternal-Fetal Medicine Specialists


What Is Maternal-Fetal Medicine?
When expecting mothers have concerns about carrying the fetus to term or other potential problems, they may be referred to a Maternal-Fetal Medicine physician.
Maternal-Fetal Medicine is specialized medical care for mothers facing high-risk pregnancy issues. Maternal-Fetal Medicine physicians receive two to three years of advanced fellowship training in obstetrical, medical, genetic and surgical complications of pregnancy and their effects on both the mother and her fetus.

This additional training allows our physicians to provide specialized care from preconception to birth.
