Lyrics


God Shed His tears on North Carolina
Written By: John G Zapp SR
(verse 1)Sitting here in North Carolina Listening to the rain falling from above
What to do in North Carolina Riding the roads while soaking in the view
(Chorus)God shed his tears on North Carolina and he’s been good to me
(verse 2)Have you seen the trees in North Carolina Do you know what makes them grow so tall
Have you seen the hills in North Carolina I know what makes them grow so high
(Chorus)
(verse 3)In the fall in North Carolina the leaves turn red with shades of orange and gold
The winters in North Carolina the Blue Ridge Mountains shadow the valley’s below
(Chorus)
(verse 4)On the Coast of North Carolina, Man took Flight on an early December Morn
From the Hills of North Carolina, The Cumberland Gap bridged the East to the West 
(Chorus)
(verse 5)I come back to North Carolina when I get tired and want to slow down
Raised my kids in North Carolina where manners and morals still prevail
(Chorus 2nd)Oh how I love my North Carolina and she is good for me
(Chorus)God shed his tears on North Carolina and he’s been good to me





Time Waits for No Soul
Written By: John G Zapp Sr
Time on Earth is FiniteUnlike Time We SpendTime for Souls is Infinite
(Chorus)Time Waits for no Soul 
You're much Older than I amIt no longer matters to meI know we’ll have our rendezvous
(Chorus)Time Waits for no Soul 
Youth is only apparentWhen the gap is wideThank those who are older
(Chorus)Time Waits for no Soul 
Souls Splits through a prismTo live and learn from lifeIn the end they join together
(Chorus)Time Waits for no Soul 
You know you have my friendshipIt'll help you weather all stormsWhen that whistle blows for boarding 
(Chorus)Time Waits for no Soul 




Peace on Earth
Written By: jgzapp
I told my Brothers and Sisters too they wouldn’t listen neither did YouOff to war, Bombs away, We didn’t find them, We’ll look another day Why are we fighting Do you really know The seeds we’re reaping are the ones we sowedThe old are weeping, The young ones die, No one has the answers, No one really knows whyAre you crying, Are those real tears, Did you loose a loved one, How many through the yearsI saw my mother and my father too Satrring at the mantle bleeding red white and blue
Peace on Earth to live another day that’s what I want and I pray
Peace on Earth good will to men that’s what I pray for… Amen




55 out of Lubbock
Written By: john zapp/wade wolfenbarger
55 out of Lubbock on that road home again been missing every day I’ve been C        goneC                                	         E                           Am    F           	                  G	 	C The skies are blue the dust here is red hard to find words can be saidC                         Dm                              C                            F                                      G          CTo tell the beauty of the Texas plains seen through my eyes today
(Chorus)F	                  G	C	                             F (bar)	        C                	     G		             It’s a College town "NOW" dressed in red and black and leaving just makes you want                     F                           G     	                   Cto come back to the giant side of Texas (Grande side of Tejas) as an alternate near the end
(Special tag on chorus after 3rd verse) F                    			      C	                                                                     G	   	 Out where the Wild West is, you’ll be treated to a good time that will always cross your mind cause….  (Back to the chorus)
(2nd verse)I’ve traveled this nation far and wide, seen deep forest and the ocean’ s tied - Watched the sun fall behind those Rockies, strolled on the streets of big cities - It’s never hard to walk away cause Lubbock just has a better way
(3rd verse)Pump Jacks scattered across the ‘scape, up and down in their familiar shape - Cotton turning land white for miles and miles, Ranches showing off the Western style - Tumbleweeds rollin’ across the road and deep canyons where rivers once flowed
(Alternate last verse)Rollin into Lubbock made it home again, gonna kick back on my front porch - Let it all soak in I’m right back where I belong - Don’t care what else is going on anymore…

Mystical Man
Written By: John G. Zapp Sr
I’m just a Mystical ManDon’t know my nameI’m just an old Mystical ManThink I’m going insane
I think I’m loosing my mind Don’t leave me aloneI thought I lost my mindWhen I couldn’t find my way home	Hey won’t you come with meYou could say where we’re goingIf you would just come with meYou could say where I been
Won’t you look in my eyesI haven’t a clueWhen you looked in my eyesI didn’t know what to do
Someone came and visited meCan you tell me her nameHey lady do I know youThat’s got to be hard on you
I’m just a Mystical ManDon’t know my nameI’m just an old Mystical ManDo you Think I’m insane
