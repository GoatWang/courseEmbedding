With a team of over 100 professionals focused on production and digital marketing, Xcel maintains control of product quality and promotion across all of its product categories and distribution channels. Xcel differentiates by design. www.xcelbrands.com Isaac Mizrahi has been a leader in the fashion industry for almost 30 years.  Since his first collection in 1987, Mr. Mizrahi's designs have come to stand for timeless, cosmopolitan, style.  He has been awarded four Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) awards, including a special award in 1996 for the groundbreaking documentary "Unzipped."  Mr. Mizrahi is Chief Designer overseeing design and design direction for the IMNYC Isaac Mizrahi, Isaac Mizrahi New York and ISAACMIZRAHILIVE! labels, which are divisions of Xcel Brands, Inc.  In 2016, Mr. Mizrahi launched his new collection IMNYC Isaac Mizrahi exclusively at Hudson's Bay and Lord & Taylor department stores.  Previously, in 2009, Mr. Mizrahi launched ISAACMIZRAHILIVE! apparel and accessories on QVC.  In addition, television audiences have come to value Isaac's media presence through his roles on "Project Runway All Stars" for Lifetime, "The Fashion Show" for Bravo and his own series for both Oxygen and the Style Network. Roy Halston Frowick was the creator of luxury American fashion, whose groundbreaking designs still influence and inspire us today. Founded in the 1960's, the HALSTON label took the fashion industry by storm. Originally known for his innovation in millinery, Halston used his signature materials of jersey, cashmere and suede to reinvent the jumpsuit, the shirtdress, and the classic caftan, permanently leaving his mark on fashion. The 1970's and the era of Studio 54 became synonymous with Halston's designs. Soon after, he was named "the premier fashion designer in America" by Newsweek. His strong connection to pop culture was evident through his friends and clients, which included Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor and Anjelica Huston. Halston went on to create one of the best-selling fragrances of all time in his signature tear-drop shaped perfume bottle designed by Elsa Peretti. Halston created strong codes that are quintessential to the brand even to this day, as a new team of innovators continue to evolve the HALSTON legacy through the H Halston and H by Halston collections. The H Halston brand, exclusive to Lord & Taylor and Hudson's Bay, offers true feminine glamour with effortless daywear, footwear, and accessories that easily transitions from work to cocktails.  The H by Halston brand, exclusive to QVC, is made up of versatile, minimalist daywear and accessories in functional fabrics and materials essential for building a chic, contemporary wardrobe. Global celebrity stylist and style authority Cameron Silver is the Fashion Director of the H Halston and H by Halston brands. Judith Ripka is an American luxury jewelry brand that appeals to women of impeccable taste worldwide. Over the brand's 37-year history, it has become known for an immediately identifiable design DNA rooted in a timelessness and tradition which will appear forever modern.  Known as the Queen of Hearts, Chief Designer Judith Ripka incorporates a matte finish, texturing, vibrant color, and, of course, hearts into almost every design.  Available in fine jewelry stores around the world and at judithripka.com, Judith Ripka Ltd. 18k Gold and Sterling Silver designs have been worn by notable celebrates such as Cindy Crawford, Kate Hudson and Rose Byrne.  Judith Ripka Ltd. was ranked as one of the top five fine jewelry brands in the US by Women's Wear Daily in 2013, and is perceived as one of the most desirable and trusted luxury jewelry brands in the world. The brand also designs an accessible luxury line under the Judith Ripka jewelry label which has been exclusive to QVC since 1997.  For further information please contact:
