A NFIP Flood Insurance policy can provide up to $250,000 of Dwelling coverage and $100,000 of Personal Property coverage in the event of a flood. Some individual carriers also offer their own flood programs with different and/or broader coverage's.Health and LifeLife InsuranceRaymond Taylor, a Queens College Graduate, started his business career in 1954 selling Life Insurance as an agent for Equitable of Iowa. A Certified Life Underwriter (CLU), he was eligible, as early as 1964, to be a member of the Million Dollar Roundtable but always declined to join. “No other professional organization gives awards based upon dollar volume,” he observes. “A doctor or lawyer doesn’t receive an award based upon the fees that they have collected.”Health InsuranceIf you get sick or have an accident health insurance will pay your hospital, laboratory, physician and prescription costs. Insurance companies in the health insurance business customarily pay the "reasonable and customary" costs associated with your accident or sickness. The charge above the reasonable and customary charge becomes your responsibility.Disability InsuranceWhile we know that everyone dies, we forget that at most ages you are more likely to become disabled. A major illness or disability could lead to very serious economic consequences. Disability insurance will pay you a monthly benefit for a certain period of time (2 years or 5 years or up to a certain age) if you become disabled due to a covered accident or sickness. These policies have a waiting period (an amount of time like 30, 60, 90 or 180 days) that must pass following the start of a disability before benefits will be paid. A good way to lower your cost for this coverage is to choose the longest waiting period before benefits are paid. When purchasing disability coverage, try to buy a policy that contains an 'own occupation' rider so that the benefits can be paid if you become disabled and can't perform any duties of your occupation for which you are qualified by training or experience.Long Term CareDental InsuranceThe following is a general summary of the insurance coverages that you should consider. It is interpretive only and is not intended to replace or supersede any of the terms and/or conditions of the policies comprising the insurance program. In case of specific interpretation of coverages, you need to refer to the actual policies. Please contact us for a copy of the policy.BusinessBusiness InsuranceWorkers Compensation InsuranceWorkers' Compensation provides coverage required by state law for injuries to association employees and volunteers that occur on the job. Workers' Compensation laws incorporate four types of benefits: disability (loss of income), medical benefits, survivor (death) benefits, and rehabilitation benefits.Builders Risk InsurancePersonalLiability InsuranceComprehensive general liability insurance extends liability coverage to any location where association business is taking place, provides coverage for host liquor, hired and non owned auto.Motor VehicleInland Marine InsuranceAuto InsurancePropertyRenters InsuranceHome InsuranceSend to PhoneMurray Alan Custom Tailors16 E 40th St, New York, NY 10016(212) 686-7848Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailMurray Alan Custom Tailors16 E 40th St, New York, NY 10016(212) 686-7848Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Description 

A gripping, authentic historical crime thriller set in Glasgow during the Second World War, focusing on The Clydebank Blitz which resulted in over 500 deaths, 600 seriously injured and 48,000 left homeless. Danny Inglis and George Maclean, officers in Military Intelligence, have the unenviable task of rooting out those German informants believed to be responsible for directing the assault but the prime suspect is found dead before he can be questioned. What has the killing to do with the IRA and could the outrageous claims of the German pilot who just crash landed in the Scottish countryside possibly be true?  In a world where nothing is as it seems, Inglis and Maclean battle through the fog of war to uncover a brutal conspiracy at the heart of the countryís fight against the Nazis. With the freedom of the world at risk, the stakes could not be higher.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							How to Locate Your Murray Model Number						



							If you’re reading this, you probably need some help finding the model number on your Murray product. Murray prints their model number on a sticker or etched plate. So you’ll want to start by trying to find that. If you've already found that, you’re ready to take your model number and start ordering parts. If not, check out some of our suggestions on finding the nameplate below:

If you have a Murray riding lawnmower, then look under the seat for the nameplate. 

If you have a walk-behind mower, check the mower’s deck, usually they place the nameplate in the center of it.

Our Customer Service team is always happy to help you search for your model number, so feel free to call us at (866) 802-6383 if you have trouble finding your tool’s information.







							Need a Hand with Your Murray Repair?						

							Our great relationship with Murray means that you’ll get the best quality OEM parts from our warehouse and the best expert advice from our technicians. So if you need a little help replacing the lawn mower blade on your Murray 30503x11A or repairing an auger shaft on a Murray 1694997, we have you covered with both a big stock of replacement parts and expert advice. 

We encourage visitors to browse our parts lists and Repair Forum to see what we can offer you. We’re confident that with our resources, we can help you through even the toughest situation.

					Yard Doctor				

					If you’ve ever owned a Murray product, you’ll understand why they  continue growing into one of the largest power equipment companies in the world. Simply put, their machines get the job done, no matter how tough it is. 

Their association with Briggs and Stratton makes their quality unmatched. So if you’re sick of spending hours shoveling snow or pushing a lawnmower, upgrade with a Murray and see why they are the choice for so many professionals.
