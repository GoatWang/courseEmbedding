        Top 30 Venture Capital Firms of 2013
    

        Who are the big spenders that help grease the wheels of biotech?
    


Alex  Philippidis





This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30 in part to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012. [Bobby4237 - Fotolia.com]









Just last week, a new biotech company called Juno Therapeutics was launched to the tune of $120 million in Series A financing. Where did this money come from? From the generous coffers of venture capital firms, including ARCH Venture Partners and the Alaska Permanent Fund. Such it is with every startup—venture capital is part of what makes new biotechs and biopharmas blossom. So, which VC companies invested money in those fields this year? Below is a list of 30 top venture capital firms, and broader financial firms that invest venture capital or other equity in early- to late-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, ranked by total capital under management or, for some firms, total active “committed” capital from funds in use.
This year’s list has been expanded to a top 30, in order to paint a more complete picture of biopharma venture investment and its key players—as well as to include the higher number of firms with funds totaling more than $1.1 billion compared with 2012.
The firms themselves are the sources of much of the information, though in some instances they have declined comment on news reports that they are raising additional capital; those instances are included in footnotes where the companies have not challenged the accuracy of the reports. In a handful of instances, figures and facts came from biographies of the firms’ principals available on the websites of investee companies and publicly available investor presentations posted online.
Interestingly, this year, five firms listed closed on new funds—less than the seven that did so last year, but a still-significant sign that more firms resumed raising new capital following years of near-standstill wrought by the 2007–09 recession.

        Top 20 Venture Capital Firms

These firms have invested the most venture capital or other equity in early- to late-stage biotechnology and pharma companies. [Bobby4237 - Fotolia.com]









In order to start up a company, one must have capital, and for some companies, a venture capital firm may be the best source for it. Venture capital firms, in exchange for equity in the companies in which they’re investing, can help provide funds for companies they think have high potential. So, which VC firms have helped pump up the most biotech and biopharma companies?
