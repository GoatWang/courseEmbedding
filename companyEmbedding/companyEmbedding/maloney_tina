Tina Maiolo partners with clients to operate and grow their businesses. She focuses her legal practice in areas that help companies function, including employment and labor matters, business immigration, civil rights issues, contracts, and all types of commercial litigation. Tina serves many clients as general counsel on employment matters. She also manages legal matters specific to nonprofit and charitable organizations as well as religious institutions.
 EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR
As part of her practice in employment and labor, civil rights, and directors and officers (D&O) liability, Tina has successfully represented many clients in claims brought under federal, state, and local laws governing fair-employment practices, including Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), employment discrimination, sexual harassment, wrongful discharge, breach of contract, negligent hiring, and defamation.
Tina represents clients before the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), state and local fair-employment agencies, and federal and state courts. She defends race and ethnicity discrimination claims brought under Title 42, Section 1981 of the US Code, as well as all other civil rights claims.
Tina serves as general counsel for corporations, associations and organizations, providing day-to-day advice on employment-related matters. She provides employers with risk management services, including the review and development of internal policies and practices. Through individual training and group seminars, Tina advises her clients in preventing employment law and civil rights violations, minimizing damages once violations occur.
 
 IMMIGRATION
As part of her immigration practice, the Embassy of Italy in the United States has certified Tina as its official referral counsel for requests for legal aid that the embassy receives from its constituency. As the only US attorney to receive this designation, Tina handles all types of immigration matters for both employers and employees throughout the country.
She works with employers to ensure they are able to transfer, hire, and retain foreign workers, while also working with individuals to assist them in obtaining or maintaining legal immigration status within the United States. Tina has extensive experience in handling all types of visas, applications for permanent residency, and the naturalization process. She also works regularly with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), local US immigration offices, and embassies and consulates over the world.
 
 BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AND LITIGATION
As part of her business law and commercial litigation practice, Tina drafts and negotiates all types of contracts, including employment agreements, compensation packages, separation or termination agreements, noncompete agreements, and nonsolicitation agreements. When needed, she defends clients in litigation arising out of such agreements. Given the nature of these claims, Tina is always ready to jump into a case to seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent continued breach and damages pending a matter’s resolution.
 
 NONPROFIT, CHARITABLE, AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
Tina is highly experienced with the considerations and interests unique to nonprofits, charities, and religious institutions in employment, civil rights, and general litigation matters. She has represented clients in multimillion-dollar claims involving church property law, the ministerial exception in employment law, and the Free Establishment Clause that precludes civil courts from delving into the policy and governance of religious institutions.
 
 REPRESENTATIVE EXPERIENCE

Successfully defended a client in an employment discrimination matter before the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. The Court affirmed a Motion for Summary Judgment that had been granted in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County.
Successfully resolved a sexual harassment claim in the religious setting after a daunting round of legal battles.
Defended a single client against multiple claims of racial discrimination, all of which the court dismissed for lack of evidence.
Defended clients in a case filed by Greenpeace. It was dismissed in federal court instead of state court like most cases, as all claims are expected to be dismissed in summary judgment.

Job Details
               Company Size: $10 mil to less than $25 mil - Employee Range: 25 to less than 100. Winslow, Evans & Crocker, Inc., is a Boston-based Massachusetts corporation established in 1991 to deliver institutional quality services and support to each of our customers. The initial focus of the firm was to meet the investment, brokerage, and underwriting needs of its principals. Over time, the capabilities of this "family office" were extended to a select group of investment professionals, Registered Investment Advisors, and institutional and strategic partners. In 1998, a decision was made to further leverage the assets of the firm by offering our services to a wider customer base. In 1999 the company became a Registered Investment Advisor with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission "SEC" in 2004 to address the growing demand for fee-based asset management. In January of 2000, the firm established a wholly owned subsidiary, Winslow, Evans & Crocker Insurance Agency, Inc., to meet the insurance needs of our customers. Today Winslow, Evans & Crocker, Inc., serves both investment professionals and private clients. In addition to participating in public underwritings, the firm has acted as investment banker for dozens of private placements. The company offers leading-edge technology and a complete range of financial products. Its primary focus remains delivering institutional quality service and support to the entire customer base. Winslow is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority "FINRA," New York Stock Exchange "NYSE," and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation"SIPC. Accounts are carried by Pershing LLC, member FINRA, NYSE, SIPC, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon). Winslow is also a Women Business Enterprise (WBE) certified through The Supplier Diversity Office FKA: SOMWBA.
