History
Since the founding of Peak Financial Management in 1991, investors have seen every kind of economic and political drama. We’ve experienced two recessions and the dot.com bubble. We’ve marveled at game-changing companies like Amazon and Google and the rise of China and other emerging economies. We’ve survived the mortgage crisis and great recession and huge governmental bailouts. We’ve seen record highs and lows.
Through it all, our approach to wealth management has remained the same — create for each client a comprehensive and customized plan that includes both financial planning and disciplined investing, and stay focused on long-term goals, not on daily fluctuations in the markets.
This long-term orientation has served our clients well, and has attributed to Peak founder Pran Tiku’s being sought for insight and advice by various financial media. He has contributed to both local and national media, including: CNBC, Medscape, and the Bazinga TV radio program.
Pran’s expertise in emerging markets led to the publication of his latest book, The Emerging Markets Handbook: An Analysis of the Investment Potential in 18 Key Emerging Economies published by Harriman House in May 2014. Pran additionally authored another book back in 2008 called Six Sizzling Markets: How to Profit from Investing in India, China, Korea, Mexico, Brazil and Russia.

Our Approach

Wealth Management
Investment Approach















 
Investment Approach
Complex challenges demand unique, imaginative solutions. At Peak Financial, we apply decades of experience, powerful technologies, and relentless research to answer your most important financial questions. We are guided by several core beliefs:

Allocate carefully – It is widely accepted that how money is distributed to different asset classes (such as bonds, stocks, emerging markets, alternatives, etc) is a prime determinant of portfolio performance. We never use a black-box formula for the allocation decision, but set allocations based on the specific needs of each client.
Diversify liberally – History proves that any investment can move in any direction at any time with no warning. We utilize mutual funds and exchange traded funds containing dozens to thousands of securities to reduce exposure to any single company, geography or industry. We do not pick individual stocks and bonds.
Maintain objectivity – As a fee-only advisor, we sell no financial products and receive no compensation of any kind from any product providers. As a result, we are able to scour markets around the world for opportunities that best match client needs.
Do the research – For a small firm, we have made large investments in information technology, providing access to cutting edge investment research and the tools to conduct our own research as well. We believe in the power of empirical evidence and seek to exploit it in making portfolio decisions.
Evolve with the client – Personal, professional and financial situations change over time. Children go to college. Parents need care. New job opportunities arise. As these changes occur, we carefully review and adjust plans and portfolios to ensure they stay completely aligned with client needs and goals.

Our Approach

Wealth Management
Investment Approach















 
Wealth Management
Wealth management can have many definitions, but at Peak Financial, we apply an intentionally broad definition that encompasses both financial planning and investment management.
We feel strongly that these two elements must go together — so that cash flow, retirement, tax and estate plans all dovetail seamlessly with the composition and management of investment accounts. It’s a holistic philosophy, one that produces unified financial solutions that balance big picture goals and the complex details of investment selection, tax rules, and much more.
To achieve these goals our team includes CFP® professionals as well as an extensive network of specialized CPA and estate planning resources.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal.

                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

Company Description


Peak Financial Management, a boutique wealth management firm, was founded in 1991. As a fee-only registered investment advisor for more than two decades, it has been our privilege to work with hundreds of individuals and families across New England and beyond.

While we have grown considerably over time, our goal has never been to become big. We value the close personal relationships we are able to develop with our clients; we think of them as our extended family. It is gratifying when clients call us for advice, referrals or just someone to talk to during an uncertain time.
