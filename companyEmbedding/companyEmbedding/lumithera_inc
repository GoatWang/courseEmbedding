  LumiThera Named Most Innovative And Promising Medtech & E-Health Company At Biovision 2017














SEATTLE, April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — LumiThera® Inc., a clinical stage medical device company focused on delivering non-invasive photobiomodulation (PBM) therapies for ocular disorders and disease, today announced it has been awarded the prestigious “MOST INNOVATIVE AND PROMISING MEDTECH & E-HEALTH COMPANY” during Biovision 2017 in Lyon, France.
Biovision is a high-level investor event connecting industrial partners, financial investors and the best medical technology, biotechnology, and e-health start-up and mid-size companies (biovision.org). The most promising companies in each category are awarded based upon key criteria such as societal benefit, market attractiveness, innovative approach, competitive position, team structure and attractiveness for investment.
This is the second year that LumiThera received the top award in its respective categories. In 2016, LumiThera was the winner in the Catalyzer category and this year it won first place in the Investor category on a unanimous vote. Selected from a pool of applicants by a special Biovision committee, companies with the greatest potential to offer innovative health solutions were invited to present during the Biovision forum in front of a jury comprised of leading European private and corporate investors in the life sciences.
“We are delighted that Biovision has recognized the scientific, clinical and product development progress LumiThera made over the last year in advancing towards the commercial introduction of our innovative technology for treating dry age related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world,” said Clark Tedford, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “We are honored to have received this second award as we prepare to bring this important therapy to the millions of patients suffering from dry AMD who have no other treatment alternatives.”
About Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for 8.7% of all blindness worldwide and is the most common cause of blindness according to the World Health Organization. Disease prevalence is likely to increase due to population aging. Approximately, 85-90% of AMD is the “dry” form of the disease. The emotional and socioeconomic impact of AMD is large because vision impairment caused by the disease, which primarily affects central (straight-on) rather than peripheral (side) vision can severely impact daily activities such as reading and driving.
About LumiThera Inc.
LumiThera, Inc. is a developmental-stage medical device company initially focused on treating patients affected by dry age-related macular degeneration. The Company’s expertise is in the application of photobiomodulation (“PBM”), using non-invasive light emitting diodes (“LED”) for acute and chronic ocular diseases and disorders. The Company is developing an ophthalmic LED office-based instrument to be used in multiple ocular conditions or disorders as non-invasive medical treatments.
Two clinical studies have demonstrated clinical and pathological benefits of PBM in treating subjects with dry AMD. The recent TORPA II clinical trial results demonstrating improvements in clinical outcomes of vision and reduction of pathological “drusen” following imaging analysis were published in December 2016 in ACTA Ophthalmologica, a top peer-reviewed Ophthalmology journal. The company is currently testing their LT-300 device in a thirty subject dry AMD study partially supported by the National Eye Institute. This randomized, sham controlled, clinical study is fully enrolled and interim outcomes are expected in 2017.

SEATTLE, May 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- LumiThera Inc., a developmental stage medical device company creating a non-invasive photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment for ocular disorders and disease, announced today that they were awarded a Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund (LSDF) commercialization grant. LumiThera was 1 of 3 recipients of the LSDF matching grants worth $500,000 to provide for commercialization activities for a treatment for subjects with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). 
LSDF executive director John DesRosier stated: "Our track record shows that LSDF grants help commercialize major medical breakthroughs and attract private funding from external investors." According to the LSDF press release, "These new awards help move promising treatments and diagnostics more quickly from the lab bench to patients in need." 
"We are very honored for the continuing support of the LSDF award program.  The seed grant allowed us to build a prototype instrument and now this matching investor commercialization grant will allow us to complete the commercial product development," stated Clark Tedford, Ph.D., President and CEO. "There are no approved treatments for dry AMD except vitamin supplements. The grant with investor matching funds will further support initiation of a pivotal clinical trial in subjects that have dry AMD.  Since the LSDF announcement, we have secured the investor match and will prepare for a clinical trial later this year."
Retired Congressman Norm Dicks, recently appointed to the Advisory team at LumiThera, shared this insight, "The use of the LSDF funds demonstrates the direct impact on creating new jobs and establishing viable business in Washington." 
The grant also provides for collaboration between LumiThera and Seattle-based Product Creation Studio (PCS), a design house that has been working with the company to create the novel instrument. "The prototype build went very well and LumiThera is now poised to bring this to market," stated Scott Thielman, Vice President, PCS.
LumiThera has generated some exciting pilot human data with their PBM approach," says Dr. Rob Devenyi, Ophthalmologist-in-Chief and Director of Retinal Services, University of Toronto. "The use of PBM could give a large number of patients a non-invasive treatment wherein there are no alternatives.  If it can slow the progression of vision loss that would be a tremendous advance in the field."

LumiThera Wins $500K Grant for PBM Devices
BioPhotonicsAug 2015

            SEATTLE — LumiThera Inc. has received a $500,000 matching grant from the Washington State Life Sciences Discovery Fund (LSDF) to commercialize devices for noninvasive photobiomodulation (PBM) treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).


"There are no approved treatments for dry AMD except vitamin supplements," said Clark Tedford, LumiThera's president and CEO. "The grant with investor matching funds will further support initiation of a pivotal clinical trial in subjects that have dry AMD. Since the LSDF announcement, we have secured the investor match and will prepare for a clinical trial later this year."


PBM, also known as low-level light therapy (LLLT) uses visible or near-IR light to stimulate cellular function and healing. LumiThera said it is developing multiwavelength LED-based PBM devices for ophthalmological use.


The new LSDSF grant also provides for collaboration between LumiThera and the Product Creation Studio Ltd. (PCS), a Seattle design house. Last year LumiThera received a $250,000 LSDF seed grant, which it used to build a prototype instrument with PCS.


"The use of PBM could give a large number of patients a noninvasive treatment wherein there are no alternatives," said Dr. Robert Devenyi, ophthalmologist-in-chief and director of retinal services at the University of Toronto. "If it can slow the progression of vision loss, that would be a tremendous advance in the field."


Devenyi, along with LumiThera founders Dr. Robert Dotson and Graham Merry, reported in a 2012 study that PBM treatments resulted in "positive and significant" changes to visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in nine patients with AMD.

The most promising companies in each category are awarded based upon key criteria such as societal benefit, market attractiveness, innovative approach, competitive position, team structure and attractiveness for investment.
This is the second year that LumiThera received the top award in its respective categories. In 2016, LumiThera was the winner in the Catalyzer category and this year it won first place in the Investor category on a unanimous vote. Selected from a pool of applicants by a special Biovision committee, companies with the greatest potential to offer innovative health solutions were invited to present during the Biovision forum in front of a jury comprised of leading European private and corporate investors in the life sciences. 
"We are delighted that Biovision has recognized the scientific, clinical and product development progress LumiThera made over the last year in advancing towards the commercial introduction of our innovative technology for treating dry age related macular degeneration (AMD), one of the leading causes of blindness in the world," said Clark Tedford, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. "We are honored to have received this second award as we prepare to bring this important therapy to the millions of patients suffering from dry AMD who have no other treatment alternatives." 
About Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for 8.7% of all blindness worldwide and is the most common cause of blindness according to the World Health Organization. Disease prevalence is likely to increase due to population aging. Approximately, 85-90% of AMD is the "dry" form of the disease. The emotional and socioeconomic impact of AMD is large because vision impairment caused by the disease, which primarily affects central (straight-on) rather than peripheral (side) vision can severely impact daily activities such as reading and driving.
About LumiThera Inc.
LumiThera, Inc. is a developmental-stage medical device company initially focused on treating patients affected by dry age-related macular degeneration. The Company's expertise is in the application of photobiomodulation ("PBM"), using non-invasive light emitting diodes ("LED") for acute and chronic ocular diseases and disorders. The Company is developing an ophthalmic LED office-based instrument to be used in multiple ocular conditions or disorders as non-invasive medical treatments. 
Two clinical studies have demonstrated clinical and pathological benefits of PBM in treating subjects with dry AMD. The recent TORPA II clinical trial results demonstrating improvements in clinical outcomes of vision and reduction of pathological "drusen" following imaging analysis were published in December 2016 in ACTA Ophthalmologica, a top peer-reviewed Ophthalmology journal. The company is currently testing their LT-300 device in a thirty subject dry AMD study partially supported by the National Eye Institute. This randomized, sham controlled, clinical study is fully enrolled and interim outcomes are expected in 2017.
The LT-300 is currently in clinical trials and is not CE Marked nor FDA 510K Cleared.
