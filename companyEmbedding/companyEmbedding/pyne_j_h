			DHSR Faculty and Staff		


todd 


			2017-05-26T19:32:19+00:00		

DHSR comprises faculty members from many different disciplines including psychiatry, psychology, counseling, pharmacy, nursing, sociology, geography, epidemiology, and bio-statistics. Many DHSR clinician-researchers choose to maintain active practices in order to better inform their research, and to translate research findings into practice. In general, faculty have minimal teaching responsibilities, though considerable effort is devoted to mentoring residents, fellows, and junior faculty. DHSR staff are experienced and devoted professionals, although there are occasional research positions available for students.
