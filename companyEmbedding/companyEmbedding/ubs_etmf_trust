Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

HEARING OR NOTIFICATION OF HEARING:

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION

Applicants
1. The Trust will be registered as an
open-end management investment
company under the Act and is a
statutory trust organized under the laws
of Delaware. Applicants seek relief with
respect to one Fund (as defined below,
and that Fund, the ââInitial Fundââ). The
portfolio positions of each Fund will
consist of securities and other assets
selected and managed by its Adviser or
Subadviser (as defined below) to pursue
the Fundâs investment objective.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware
corporation, will be the investment
adviser to the Initial Fund. An Adviser
(as defined below) will serve as
investment adviser to each Fund. The
Adviser is, and any other Adviser will
be, registered as an investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (ââAdvisers Actââ). The Adviser may
retain one or more subadvisers (each a

Sfmt 4703

ââSubadviserââ) to manage the portfolios
of the Funds. Any Subadviser will be
registered, or not subject to registration,
under the Advisers Act.
3. The Distributor is a Delaware
corporation and a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and will act as the
principal underwriter of Shares of the
Funds. Applicants request that the
requested relief apply to any distributor
of Shares, whether affiliated or
unaffiliated with the Adviser (included
in the term ââDistributorââ). Any
Distributor will comply with the terms
and conditions of the Order.
Applicantsâ Requested Exemptive Relief
4. Applicants seek the requested
Order under section 6(c) of the Act for
an exemption from sections 2(a)(32),
5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and
rule 22câ1 under the Act, under
sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an
exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and
17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section
12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption
from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the
Act. The requested Order would permit
applicants to offer exchange-traded
managed funds. Because the relief
requested is the same as the relief
granted by the Commission under the
Reference Order and because the
Adviser has entered into, or anticipates
entering into, a licensing agreement
with Eaton Vance Management, or an
affiliate thereof in order to offer
exchange-traded managed funds,2 the
Order would incorporate by reference
the terms and conditions of the
Reference Order.
5. Applicants request that the Order
apply to the Initial Fund and to any
other existing or future open-end
management investment company or
series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the
Adviser or any entity controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser (any such entity
included in the term ââAdviserââ); and (b)
operates as an exchange-traded managed
fund as described in the Reference
Order; and (c) complies with the terms
and conditions of the Order and of the
Reference Order, which is incorporated
by reference herein (each such company
or series and Initial Fund, a ââFundââ).3
6. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that
the Commission may exempt any
2 Eaton Vance Management has obtained patents
with respect to certain aspects of the Fundsâ method
of operation as exchange-traded managed funds.
3 All entities that currently intend to rely on the
Order are named as applicants. Any other entity
that relies on the Order in the future will comply
with the terms and conditions of the Order and of
the Reference Order, which is incorporated by
reference herein.

person, security or transaction, or any
class of persons, securities or
transactions, from any provisions of the
Act, if and to the extent that such
exemption is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the
purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b)
of the Act authorizes the Commission to

to be paid or received, are reasonable
and fair and do not involve
overreaching on the part of any person
concerned, and the proposed
transaction is consistent with the
policies of the registered investment
company and the general purposes of
the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act
provides that the Commission may
exempt any person, security, or
transaction, or any class or classes of
persons, securities or transactions, from
any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
7. Applicants submit that for the
reasons stated in the Reference Order:
(1) With respect to the relief requested
pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the
relief is appropriate, in the public
interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act; (2) with respect to
the relief request pursuant to section
17(b) of the Act, the proposed
transactions are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned, are consistent
with the policies of each registered
investment company concerned and
consistent with the general purposes of
the Act; and (3) with respect to the relief
requested pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(J)
of the Act, the relief is consistent with
the public interest and the protection of
investors.

Management, pursuant to delegated
authority.

Requirements
March 10, 2017.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
ââActââ),1 and Rule 19bâ4 thereunder,2
notice is hereby given that on February
28, 2017, the International Securities
Exchange, LLC (ââISEââ or ââExchangeââ)
filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (ââSECââ or ââCommissionââ)
the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items
have been prepared by the Exchange.
The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the
proposed rule change from interested
persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organizationâs
Statement of the Terms of Substance of
the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange proposes to amend
Rule 705 (Limitation of Liability) to
harmonize its liability caps and related
reimbursement requirements with those
of NASDAQ BX, Inc. (ââBXââ), NASDAQ
PHLX LLC (ââPhlxââ) and NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC (ââNSMââ and together with
BX and Phlx, the ââNasdaq Exchangesââ).
The text of the proposed rule change
is available on the Exchangeâs Web site

A. Self-Regulatory Organizationâs
Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
1. Purpose
The purpose of this proposed rule
change is to amend Rule 705 (Limitation
of Liability) to harmonize the
Exchangeâs existing liability caps and
related reimbursement requirements for
claims under Rule 705(d) with the caps
and requirements set forth in the rules
of the Nasdaq Exchanges.3 The
Exchange and its affiliates, ISE Gemini,
LLC and ISE Mercury, LLC (together, the
ââISE Exchangesââ), were recently
acquired (the ââAcquisitionââ) by Nasdaq,
Inc. (ââHoldCoââ).4 In the context of the
Acquisition, the ISE Exchanges are
working to align certain rules with rules
of the Nasdaq Exchanges in order to
provide consistent standards across the
six exchanges operated by HoldCo (the
ââHoldCo Affiliated Exchangesââ). As part
of this effort, the proposal set forth
below harmonizes the Exchangeâs
liability caps and the related
reimbursement requirements with those
of the Nasdaq Exchanges in order to
provide uniform standards and
requirements for users of the HoldCo
Affiliated Exchanges.5
Rule 705 in its current form generally
states that the Exchange is not liable for
any losses due to the Exchangeâs
negligence or unintentional actions, but
also provides in Rule 705(d) that
notwithstanding this general limitation
on liability, the Exchange may
compensate its members for losses
resulting directly from the malfunction
of the Exchangeâs physical equipment,
devices and/or programming.
Subsections (d)(1)â(d)(3) of Rule 705
contains express conditions governing
the voluntary payments made by the
Exchange under these limited
circumstances. Specifically, the
Exchangeâs payments for any and all
system failures on a single trading day
are capped at $250,000 under
subsection (d)(1). The rule text states
that for the aggregate of all claims made
by all market participants related to the
use of the Exchange on a single trading
day, the Exchangeâs payments shall not
exceed $250,000. Subsection (d)(2)
further provides that if the cumulative
claims exceed the $250,000 cap, this
3 See BX Rule 4626(b) and Phlx Rule 1015. See
also NSM Rule 4626(b).
4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 78119
(June 21, 2016), 81 FR 41611 (June 27, 2016) (SRâ
ISEâ2016â11; SRâISEGeminiâ2016â05; SRâ
ISEMercuryâ2016â10).
5 ISE Gemini, LLC and ISE Mercury, LLC will
each file a proposed rule change with the
Commission to adopt similar requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the 
application. The complete application may be obtained via the 
Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an 
applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.

Applicants

    1. The Trust will be registered as an open-end management 
investment company under the Act and is a statutory trust organized 
under the laws of Delaware. Applicants seek relief with respect to one 
Fund (as defined below, and that Fund, the ``Initial Fund''). The 
portfolio positions of each Fund will consist of securities and other 
assets selected and managed by its Adviser or Subadviser (as defined 
below) to pursue the Fund's investment objective.
    2. The Adviser, a Delaware corporation, will be the investment 
adviser to the Initial Fund. An Adviser (as defined below) will serve 
as investment adviser to each Fund. The Adviser is, and any other 
Adviser will be, registered as an investment adviser under the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act''). The Adviser may 
retain one or more subadvisers (each a ``Subadviser'') to manage the 
portfolios of the Funds. Any Subadviser will be registered, or not 
subject to registration, under the Advisers Act.
    3. The Distributor is a Delaware corporation and a broker-dealer 
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will act as 
the principal underwriter of Shares of the Funds. Applicants request 
that the requested relief apply to any distributor of Shares, whether 
affiliated or unaffiliated with the Adviser (included in the term 
``Distributor''). Any Distributor will comply with the terms and 
conditions of the Order.

Applicants' Requested Exemptive Relief

    4. Applicants seek the requested Order under section 6(c) of the 
Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) 
of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) 
of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the 
Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from 
sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. The requested Order would 
permit applicants to offer exchange-traded managed funds. Because the 
relief requested is the same as the relief granted by the Commission 
under the Reference Order and because the Adviser has entered into, or 
anticipates entering into, a licensing agreement with Eaton Vance 
Management, or an affiliate thereof in order to offer exchange-traded 
managed funds,\2\ the Order would incorporate by reference the terms 
and conditions of the Reference Order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Eaton Vance Management has obtained patents with respect to 
certain aspects of the Funds' method of operation as exchange-traded 
managed funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Applicants request that the Order apply to the Initial Fund and 
to any other existing or future open-end management investment company 
or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or any entity 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser 
(any such entity included in the term ``Adviser''); and (b) operates as 
an exchange-traded managed fund as described in the Reference Order; 
and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the Order and of the 
Reference Order, which is incorporated by reference herein (each such 
company or series and Initial Fund, a ``Fund'').\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ All entities that currently intend to rely on the Order are 
named as applicants. Any other entity that relies on the Order in 
the future will comply with the terms and conditions of the Order 
and of the Reference Order, which is incorporated by reference 
herein.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt 
any

[[Page 14041]]

person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or 
transactions, from any provisions of the Act, if and to the extent that 
such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the 
Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from 
section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the 
transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are 
reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any 
person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the 
policies of the registered investment company and the general purposes 
of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission 
may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or 
classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of 
section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public 
interest and the protection of investors.
    7. Applicants submit that for the reasons stated in the Reference 
Order: (1) With respect to the relief requested pursuant to section 
6(c) of the Act, the relief is appropriate, in the public interest and 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly 
intended by the policy and provisions of the Act; (2) with respect to 
the relief request pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act, the proposed 
transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on 
the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of 
each registered investment company concerned and consistent with the 
general purposes of the Act; and (3) with respect to the relief 
requested pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act, the relief is 
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.


    By the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated 
authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

        March 10, 2017.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ).
ACTION:
Notice of an application for an order under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (âActâ) for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
APPLICANTS:

Applicants request an order (âOrderâ) that permits: (a) Actively managed series of certain open-end management investment companies to issue shares (âSharesâ) redeemable in large aggregations only (âCreation Unitsâ); (b) secondary market transactions in Shares to occur at the next-determined net asset value plus or minus a market-determined premium or discount that may vary during the trading day; (c) certain series to pay redemption proceeds, under certain circumstances, more than seven days from the tender of Shares for redemption; (d) certain affiliated persons of the series to deposit securities into, and receive securities from, the series in connection with the purchase and redemption of Creation Units; (e) certain registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts outside of the same group of investment companies as the series to acquire Shares; and (f) certain series to create and redeem Shares in kind in a master-feeder structure. The Order would incorporate by reference terms and conditions of a previous order granting the same relief sought by applicants, as that order may be amended from time to time (âReference Orderâ).[1] 

FILING DATES:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/âsearch/âsearch.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants
1. The Trust will be registered as an open-end management investment company under the Act and is a statutory trust organized under the laws of Delaware. Applicants seek relief with respect to one Fund (as defined below, and that Fund, the âInitial Fundâ). The portfolio positions of each Fund will consist of securities and other assets selected and managed by its Adviser or Subadviser (as defined below) to pursue the Fund's investment objective.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware corporation, will be the investment adviser to the Initial Fund. An Adviser (as defined below) will serve as investment adviser to each Fund. The Adviser is, and any other Adviser will be, registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (âAdvisers Actâ). The Adviser may retain one or more subadvisers (each a âSubadviserâ) to manage the portfolios of the Funds. Any Subadviser will be registered, or not subject to registration, under the Advisers Act.
3. The Distributor is a Delaware corporation and a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will act as the principal underwriter of Shares of the Funds. Applicants request that the requested relief apply to any distributor of Shares, whether affiliated or unaffiliated with the Adviser (included in the term âDistributorâ). Any Distributor will comply with the terms and conditions of the Order.
Applicants' Requested Exemptive Relief
4. Applicants seek the requested Order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. The requested Order would permit applicants to offer exchange-traded managed funds. Because the relief requested is the same as the relief granted by the Commission under the Reference Order and because the Adviser has entered into, or anticipates entering into, a licensing agreement with Eaton Vance Management, or an affiliate thereof in order to offer exchange-traded managed funds,[2] 
           the Order would incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of the Reference Order.
5. Applicants request that the Order apply to the Initial Fund and to any other existing or future open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser (any such entity included in the term âAdviserâ); and (b) operates as an exchange-traded managed fund as described in the Reference Order; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the Order and of the Reference Order, which is incorporated by reference herein (each such company or series and Initial Fund, a âFundâ).[3] 

6. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any Start Printed Page 14041person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any provisions of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general purposes of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
7. Applicants submit that for the reasons stated in the Reference Order: (1) With respect to the relief requested pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the relief is appropriate, in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act; (2) with respect to the relief request pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act, the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of each registered investment company concerned and consistent with the general purposes of the Act; and (3) with respect to the relief requested pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act, the relief is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.

Notice of an application for an order under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Act") for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act.
Citation: "82 FR 14040"
Document Number: "Investment Company Act Release No. IC-32529; 812-14727"
Page Number: "14040"
"Notices"
March 10, 2017.
APPLICANTS: UBS ETMF Trust (the "Trust"), UBS Asset Management Company (Americas) Inc. (the "Adviser") and UBS Asset Management (US) Inc. (the "Distributor").
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: Applicants request an order ("Order") that permits: (a) Actively managed series of certain open-end management investment companies to issue shares ("Shares") redeemable in large aggregations only ("Creation Units"); (b) secondary market transactions in Shares to occur at the next-determined net asset value plus or minus a market-determined premium or discount that may vary during the trading day; (c) certain series to pay redemption proceeds, under certain circumstances, more than seven days from the tender of Shares for redemption; (d) certain affiliated persons of the series to deposit securities into, and receive securities from, the series in connection with the purchase and redemption of Creation Units; (e) certain registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts outside of the same group of investment companies as the series to acquire Shares; and (f) certain series to create and redeem Shares in kind in a master-feeder structure. The Order would incorporate by reference terms and conditions of a previous order granting the same relief sought by applicants, as that order may be amended from time to time ("Reference Order"). /1/
/1/ Eaton Vance Management, et al., Investment Company Act Rel. Nos. 31333 (Nov. 6, 2014) (notice) and 31361 (Dec. 2, 2014) (order). END FOOTNOTE
FILING DATES: The application was filed on December 14, 2016 and amended on March 1, 2017.
HEARING OR NOTIFICATION OF HEARING: An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on April 4, 2017, and should be accompanied by proof of service on applicants, in the form of an affidavit or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.
Â Â Â ADDRESSES: The Commission: Brent J. Fields, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applicants: Mark F. Kemper, Esq., 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019-6028.
Â Â Â FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Aaron T. Gilbride, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6906 or Holly Hunter-Ceci, Acting Assistant Chief Counsel, at (202) 551-6825 (Division of Investment Management, Chief Counsel's Office).
Â Â Â SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants
Â Â Â 1. The Trust will be registered as an open-end management investment company under the Act and is a statutory trust organized under the laws of Delaware. Applicants seek relief with respect to one Fund (as defined below, and that Fund, the "Initial Fund"). The portfolio positions of each Fund will consist of securities and other assets selected and managed by its Adviser or Subadviser (as defined below) to pursue the Fund's investment objective.
Â Â Â 2. The Adviser, a Delaware corporation, will be the investment adviser to the Initial Fund. An Adviser (as defined below) will serve as investment adviser to each Fund. The Adviser is, and any other Adviser will be, registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act"). The Adviser may retain one or more subadvisers (each a "Subadviser") to manage the portfolios of the Funds. Any Subadviser will be registered, or not subject to registration, under the Advisers Act.
Â Â Â 3. The Distributor is a Delaware corporation and a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will act as the principal underwriter of Shares of the Funds. Applicants request that the requested relief apply to any distributor of Shares, whether affiliated or unaffiliated with the Adviser (included in the term "Distributor"). Any Distributor will comply with the terms and conditions of the Order.
Applicants' Requested Exemptive Relief
Â Â Â 4. Applicants seek the requested Order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 5(a)(1), 22(d) and 22(e) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act, under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act, and under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. The requested Order would permit applicants to offer exchange-traded managed funds. Because the relief requested is the same as the relief granted by the Commission under the Reference Order and because the Adviser has entered into, or anticipates entering into, a licensing agreement with Eaton Vance Management, or an affiliate thereof in order to offer exchange-traded managed funds, /2/ the Order would incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of the Reference Order.
Â Â Â FOOTNOTE 2 Eaton Vance Management has obtained patents with respect to certain aspects of the Funds' method of operation as exchange-traded managed funds. END FOOTNOTE
Â Â Â 5. Applicants request that the Order apply to the Initial Fund and to any other existing or future open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (a) Is advised by the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser (any such entity included in the term "Adviser"); and (b) operates as an exchange-traded managed fund as described in the Reference Order; and (c) complies with the terms and conditions of the Order and of the Reference Order, which is incorporated by reference herein (each such company or series and Initial Fund, a "Fund"). /3/
Â Â Â FOOTNOTE 3 All entities that currently intend to rely on the Order are named as applicants. Any other entity that relies on the Order in the future will comply with the terms and conditions of the Order and of the Reference Order, which is incorporated by reference herein. END FOOTNOTE
Â Â Â 6. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any  person, security or transaction, or any class of persons, securities or transactions, from any provisions of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general purposes of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
Â Â Â 7. Applicants submit that for the reasons stated in the Reference Order: (1) With respect to the relief requested pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, the relief is appropriate, in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act; (2) with respect to the relief request pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act, the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of each registered investment company concerned and consistent with the general purposes of the Act; and (3) with respect to the relief requested pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act, the relief is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
By the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.
