Alcoa Announces Organization Changes Richard Kelson to Retire; Joe Muscari to Become New CFO; Helmut Wieser to Add Rigid Packaging, Asia to Global Rolled Products Business






November 14, 2005 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



				NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2005--Alain Belda, Chairman and CEO of Alcoa announced today that Richard B. Kelson, Chief Financial Officer and EVP, has chosen to retire and that Joseph C. Muscari would succeed him in that role, effective January 1, 2006.  "Rick Kelson has been an integral part of Alcoa's success over the past three decades," said Belda. "Rick successfully drove the company's two successful billion-dollar cost savings programs, created a top-notch finance team, transformed Alcoa's shared services organization, and built a world-class organization to improve environment, health and safety performance. We are sorry to lose him, but I am pleased that he has agreed to stay on well into next year to help provide for a smooth transition." Mr. Kelson will become Chairman's Counsel in January and will continue to advise the company on the transition. 

 Joe Muscari, currently EVP for Asia, Rigid Packaging and Global Foil, will become Chief Financial Officer after a wide-ranging 36-year career at Alcoa. "Joe has a unique combination of talents that make him perfectly suited to the CFO role," said Belda. "He has strong international experience, having run Alcoa's businesses in Latin America, Japan and China. He created the strategy to drive our expansion in Asia, where we now have $1.7 billion in annual revenue and more than 2500 employees. With a strong financial background including stints running corporate audit, environment, health & safety, compliance as well as finance for several major businesses, Joe has the right mix of talent and experience for the opportunities we are pursuing." Today, Muscari has accountability for the Rigid Packaging Division (the company's can sheet business), the commercial foil business, as well as Alcoa's operations in Asia, with combined revenues of more than $3.5 billion in revenue. Muscari also has significant transactional experience having led a number of major investments and divestitures in Asia and Latin America.  Helmut Wieser, currently Group President of the North American and European Mill Products, will assume additional responsibility for the can sheet and hard alloy extrusion businesses. He will also oversee the company's business in the Asia Pacific region, with a focus on China and the Australian rolled products business. The new group will include all of the company's worldwide rolled products, hard alloy and rod and bar extrusion products, and its commercial foil businesses, accounting for more than $7.8 billion in 2004 revenue and 15,000 employees. Helmut will become an Executive Vice President of the company.  "This move will allow Helmut to build a truly global rolled and extruded products business focused on our customers in the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, packaging and industrial markets," said Belda "His global knowledge and experience, together with his excellent business acumen and ability to drive results will continue to benefit Alcoa and our shareholders."  The personnel changes were approved by the Company's Board of Directors at their November Board meeting, which was held on Friday, November 11, 2005.  A separate press release describes the reorganization of the company's extrusion businesses.  Background on Richard B. Kelson  Richard B.
