					Don't let the pink color of the TAG Heuer Women's Tiger Woods Professional Rubber Sports Watch #WAE1114.FT6011 fool you. While it looks ultra-feminine, it has features and functions that it make it great for an athlete to wear on or off the course or court. The durable rubber band has a raised-dot pattern and the TAG Heuer logo. The band is complemented by a silver-tone stainless steel, rectangular bezel. The pink mother of pearl dial features silver-tone Arabic numbers at six and 12 o'clock and silver-tone indexes in the other positions. A calendar window sits at three o'clock. The dial has silver-tone luminous hands and a sweeping seconds hand. This watch is water resistant to 165 feet.

At Amazon Fashion, we believe that Smart is Beautiful. That’s why we offer a vast yet easy-to-shop selection of women’s clothing, shoes, jewelry, watches, handbags, and more that answer women’s fashion needs for the workplace, special occasions, and everyday style.
Each season you’ll find a carefully curated assortment of women’s clothing and accessories from new and established brands–including Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Clarks, DKNYC, Fossil, Guess, Invicta, Jessica Simpson, kate spade new york, Levi’s, Nine West, Sam Edelman, Theory, Tommy Hilfiger, Versace, and hundreds more. Our women’s clothing selection houses both classic and on-trend options so you can find exactly what you want–favorite denim, women’s dresses, office-ready looks, everyday tees, swimwear, and other wardrobe essentials. Check out our selection of women’s shoes for styles that complement the latest women’s clothing, or to find must-haves like running shoes, rain boots, and outdoor shoes. Additionally, our women’s watches and jewelry categories serve up stylish accents to suit any occasion or outfit.
For specific women’s fashion needs, take a look at our specialty shops, which offer athletic wear, plus and petite sizes, maternity clothing, and more. And for those searching for gifts for women who love fashion, you’ll find a wealth of sparkling watches, fine jewelry, luxe handbags, and other style-centric options that fit virtually any budget.
To keep you in-the-know about new women’s fashion, we provide features on emerging trends, styling advice, and more. For example, you may find tips on what to pack for a weekend getaway, the key pieces to invest in for the season, and can’t-miss holiday gifts for everyone on your list.
Amazon wants to make your shopping experience as convenient as possible, which is why we’ve organized our women’s fashion into easily searchable categories. You can easily filter by item, brand, size, color, and more to find the items you need–and want–now. Best of all, many of our items are eligible for free shipping and free returns, meaning you can shop worry-free.
