Entertainment Control through Smart Devices

				UEI offers embedded software and hardware solutions for smart device entertainment control							








 
UEI puts you in control of technology Today's home has become the hub for a complex collection of devices, each speaking a seemingly different language. As new items are introduced into the home, how will they work with the devices that are already there? Will they be compatible and speak the same language? Will people be able to easily combine images from their new video and digital cameras and display them on their TVs - and do it all from the comfort of their living rooms?

 At Universal Electronics, we're solving these problems by providing the intelligence inside personal computers, electronic devices, and wireless controllers - solutions that simplify access to, and control of, the growing complexity of devices in the home. We're all addressing the issue of interoperability by designing products and licensing our connectivity software, covering over 700,000 individual device functions, to companies around the world.




 
Connectivity Zigbee® RF4CE, Wi-Fi Direct™, NFC, and Bluetooth® - the latest developments in innovative connectivity solutions for control and content engagement Learn More





 
Ease of Setup and Control The proliferation of technology in the home creates a wide range of choices for 
the consumer. Serving this audience requires deciding on what types of 
technology to integrate into control devices and how to enable your remote to speak to them ... Learn More





 
Voice Control and Advanced Navigation Home
entertainment control continues to evolve as demands from consumers, and the proliferation
of content and services have driven advances in the user onscreen interface and
consequently the navigation, design, and two-way interactions between devices and
remote controls.  UEI is the industry
leader in matching the right technology to meet these interaction needs.  UEI has the experience necessary to
successfully design and implement solutions

Integrating Smart Devices Into Home Entertainment Tablets and smartphones are quickly becoming a regular part of the home entertainment ecosystem.  According to Nielsen Research, almost 90 percent of tablet and smartphone owners in the U.S. use their smart screen device while watching TV at least once during a month; almost 70% are doing this several times a week.

Products[edit]
UEI is one the world's largest manufacturer of remote controls, responsible for an estimated 30% global market share in home entertainment remotes.[7] Under its Ecolink brand, it also makes home security and automation products such as motion and door/window entry sensors for DIY and professional home security markets and OEMs such as Interlogix (UTC), Honeywell and Tyco . Many of the control products are made under contract and then sold under the brand name of larger consumer electronic manufacturers such as Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba, Daikin, Mitsubishi, Yamaha, and Sharp, as well as North American cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast, Rogers, Cox, Shaw, Charter, DIRECTV and DISH.[7][8]
UEI makes numerous products that use ZigBee, Bluetooth[9] or Wi-Fi technology. They are a member of the ZigBee Alliance, Bluetooth SIG[10] and Wi-Fi Alliance.[11]
QuickSet[edit]
QuickSet[12][13] is Universal Electronics’ software product family including web services and embedded SDK for simplifying discovery and universal control setup and operation in a smart home. QuickSet solution is a widely[14] deployed technology already in over 400 million devices around the world including set-top boxes from Comcast,[15] Dish Network[9] and DirecTV,[16] televisions from Samsung[17][18] and Sony, game consoles such as Xbox One,[19] and many leading smartphones,[20][21] and tablets to enable automatic discovery and control of nearly any connected home device.
QuickSet Cloud, part of QuickSet product family, is actively used by millions of devices every week such as Comcast's X1[22] Platform. This platform is capable of automatically discovering devices through different interfaces such as IP or HDMI based on proprietary fingerprinting algorithms, and controlling these devices through a range of protocols such as IR, IP, HDMI-CEC, ZigBee or Bluetooth
Acquisitions[edit]
On February 2009, UEI purchased all of Zilog's software & IP assets related to Zilog's universal remote control business, including all ROM code, software, and database of infrared codes.[23] Zilog sold these assets for $31 million cash.
In August 2015, UEI strengthened its position in the smart home market by acquiring Ecolink Intelligent Technology, a wireless home security and automation specialist.[24] In May 2017, UEI further expanded its smart home offering by acquiring RCS Technology, a pioneer in smart thermostats and energy management.[25]
