Soma is So Much More than Sexy.
In 2004, a design team of women set out to create something they saw missing from the marketplace: a line that gives women what they really want. Bras as comfortable as they are beautiful. Panties that stay where they should. Pajamas that bring the softest sleep. The team began innovating, and they started Soma. Nearly 300 boutiques and millions of loyal customers later, Soma continues to improve women's lives every day through exceptional service and exclusive products. Because confidence is the sexiest thing a woman can wear.

PTC Solution Will Drive Down Development Time and Production Costs













NEEDHAM, MA. - March 15, 2011 - PTC (Nasdaq: PTC), The Product Development Company, today announced that Chico's FAS, Inc. has selected PTC FlexPLM Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software to harmonize operations across category, brand, and departments. By choosing Windchill FlexPLM across all of its brands, including Chico's, White House|Black Market and Soma Intimates, the company is demonstrating a commitment to increase operational and inventory efficiency and reduce development time and production cost.
"When evaluating PLM vendors, we wanted software that was not only going to help us drive productivity and reduce costs, but we wanted a solution that was going to be easy to use," said Krissy Blakeway, senior vice president of Chico's design and product development. "As the technology leader, PTC was the unanimous choice of our user community. We believe that as we move forward and standardize on Windchill FlexPLM, our ability to be first to market with the latest fashion will be enhanced."
The retail industry is currently facing a number of hurdles, some of the most challenging being margin management/reduced product cost, inventory efficiency and productivity. By implementing Windchill FlexPLM, Chico's expects to realize reductions in materials costs, cycle times and product development costs.
"PTC fully understands the retail industry pain points and we work closely with our customers to not only help them overcome those existing challenges, but to look ahead, anticipate needs and innovate," said Kathleen Mitford, vice president, market strategy, PTC. "Chico's FAS, Inc. is already a leader and by standardizing on Windchill, the company will be able to continue to expand its position by realizing the benefits of margin improvement, cycle reduction time and personal productivity gains."

History[edit]
1972–1990[edit]
Founders Marvin and Helene Gralnick, met in 1972 while living in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 1983, they opened a tiny Mexican folk art gift shop in Periwinkle Place on Sanibel Island, Florida.[4] Helene named the shop Folk Art Specialties and then changed the name to Chico's Folk Art Specialties after a friend’s pet parrot, Chico.[4] The store sold mostly art, but the sweaters in the store outsold everything else, so Chico's Folk Art Specialties transformed into a clothing boutique.[2][4]
In 1985, Chico's Folk Art Specialties opened a second boutique on Captiva Island, Florida. All early boutiques were infused with Mexican folk art combined with antiques and fixtures manufactured in Marvin’s in-house woodshop.[2][4]
In the beginning, Marvin and Helene would not close the store until they reached a certain amount of sales each day. They also could not afford to have bags printed, so the name was handwritten on each bag.[2]
The first franchise store opened in Edina, Minnesota in 1987. In 1989, the company shortened its name to Chico's FAS (an abbreviation for Folk Art Specialties) and launched the Passport Loyalty Rewards program.[2]
1991–2000[edit]
In 1991, Chico's FAS expanded into cities ranging from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Newport, Rhode Island. By 1992, the company operated 60 boutiques and began designing its own prints and patterns.[2]
Chico's FAS went public in 1993 and began trading on NASDAQ under the title CHCS. It premiered its Most Amazing Personal Service (MAPS) customer service initiative in 1998. Between 1998 and 2000, Chico's sales increased an average of 50 percent per year.[2][4]
In 1999, Chico's FAS began online sales at Chicos.com in 1999. It also began advertising in national magazines, including Martha Stewart Living and Marie Claire.[2]
2001–2010[edit]
In 2001, the Chico's FAS Founders building opened in Fort Myers, Florida, and Chico's FAS debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.[2][4]
Chico's FAS aired its first commercial in six major markets on The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, and on Martha Stewart Living.[2]
Average new store sales reached $1.45 million per year in 2003. The next year, Chico's FAS acquired White House | Black Market, a women’s clothing company that focuses on white, black, and other variants of the two colors. Chico's FAS also launched Soma, an intimate apparel boutique.[2]
In 2006, Chico's FAS added 24 acres to the Fort Myers campus to support growth and stock reached a high of $49.40.[2]
2011–present[edit]
In 2011, Chico's FAS acquired Boston Proper, which is a brand available online or by catalog.[5] Two years later, Boston Proper opened its first boutique at Coconut Point in Estero, Florida.[2]
As of January 2014[update], Chico's FAS Inc was accused, by a Florida-based handbag designer, in a lawsuit of forcing the designer "to copy other designers’ creations."[6]
In 2013, Chico's FAS expanded internationally by opening White House | Black Market stores in Canada.[7] On May 13, 2014, Chico's FAS announced expansion of the Chico's brand into Canada.[8] Three boutiques have since opened in Canada.[1] Further international expansion has occurred with its namesake Chico's into Mexico in 2014. Through an exclusive franchise with El Puerto de Liverpool ("Liverpool"), Chico's opened a stand-alone boutique at Perisur Mall, Mexico City. Plans for further Chico's expansion into Mexico include more openings of stand-alone boutiques as well as branded shop-in-shops in Liverpool department stores.[8]
Chico's FAS brands[edit]
Chico's[edit]
Chico's primarily sells private branded clothing for women, with a focus on jackets, statement jewelry and clothing with bold prints and patterns.[9] The brand has its own unique sizing that runs from 000-4.5.[10]
White House | Black Market[edit]
The White House | Black Market brand began in 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland and was acquired by Chico's FAS in 2003.[11] It primarily offers exclusively designed, private label women’s clothing and accessory items with a "boutique feel".[clarification needed] Accessory items range from shoes to scarves to jewelry and belts.[12] The focus of each seasonal assortment ranges from everyday basics, to wear-to-work, to fashion in monochromatic black, white, and related shades with "seasonal color splashes".[13]
Soma[edit]
Soma was launched by Chico's FAS in 2004.[2] The brand primarily sells lingerie, sleepwear and beauty products. The brand also offers dresses and loungewear. Lines with "slimming solutions" include loungewear, swimwear and corsetry.[14]

History[edit]
1972–1990[edit]
Founders Marvin and Helene Gralnick, met in 1972 while living in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 1983, they opened a tiny Mexican folk art gift shop in Periwinkle Place on Sanibel Island, Florida.[4] Helene named the shop Folk Art Specialties and then changed the name to Chico's Folk Art Specialties after a friend’s pet parrot, Chico.[4] The store sold mostly art, but the sweaters in the store outsold everything else, so Chico's Folk Art Specialties transformed into a clothing boutique.[2][4]
In 1985, Chico's Folk Art Specialties opened a second boutique on Captiva Island, Florida. All early boutiques were infused with Mexican folk art combined with antiques and fixtures manufactured in Marvin’s in-house woodshop.[2][4]
In the beginning, Marvin and Helene would not close the store until they reached a certain amount of sales each day. They also could not afford to have bags printed, so the name was handwritten on each bag.[2]
The first franchise store opened in Edina, Minnesota in 1987. In 1989, the company shortened its name to Chico's FAS (an abbreviation for Folk Art Specialties) and launched the Passport Loyalty Rewards program.[2]
1991–2000[edit]
In 1991, Chico's FAS expanded into cities ranging from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Newport, Rhode Island. By 1992, the company operated 60 boutiques and began designing its own prints and patterns.[2]
Chico's FAS went public in 1993 and began trading on NASDAQ under the title CHCS. It premiered its Most Amazing Personal Service (MAPS) customer service initiative in 1998. Between 1998 and 2000, Chico's sales increased an average of 50 percent per year.[2][4]
In 1999, Chico's FAS began online sales at Chicos.com in 1999. It also began advertising in national magazines, including Martha Stewart Living and Marie Claire.[2]
2001–2010[edit]
In 2001, the Chico's FAS Founders building opened in Fort Myers, Florida, and Chico's FAS debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.[2][4]
Chico's FAS aired its first commercial in six major markets on The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, and on Martha Stewart Living.[2]
Average new store sales reached $1.45 million per year in 2003. The next year, Chico's FAS acquired White House | Black Market, a women’s clothing company that focuses on white, black, and other variants of the two colors. Chico's FAS also launched Soma, an intimate apparel boutique.[2]
In 2006, Chico's FAS added 24 acres to the Fort Myers campus to support growth and stock reached a high of $49.40.[2]
2011–present[edit]
In 2011, Chico's FAS acquired Boston Proper, which is a brand available online or by catalog.[5] Two years later, Boston Proper opened its first boutique at Coconut Point in Estero, Florida.[2]
As of January 2014[update], Chico's FAS Inc was accused, by a Florida-based handbag designer, in a lawsuit of forcing the designer "to copy other designers’ creations."[6]
In 2013, Chico's FAS expanded internationally by opening White House | Black Market stores in Canada.[7] On May 13, 2014, Chico's FAS announced expansion of the Chico's brand into Canada.[8] Three boutiques have since opened in Canada.[1] Further international expansion has occurred with its namesake Chico's into Mexico in 2014. Through an exclusive franchise with El Puerto de Liverpool ("Liverpool"), Chico's opened a stand-alone boutique at Perisur Mall, Mexico City. Plans for further Chico's expansion into Mexico include more openings of stand-alone boutiques as well as branded shop-in-shops in Liverpool department stores.[8]
Chico's FAS brands[edit]

Chico's primarily sells private branded clothing for women, with a focus on jackets, statement jewelry and clothing with bold prints and patterns.[9] The brand has its own unique sizing that runs from 000-4.5.[10]
White House | Black Market[edit]
The White House | Black Market brand began in 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland and was acquired by Chico's FAS in 2003.[11] It primarily offers exclusively designed, private label women’s clothing and accessory items with a "boutique feel".[clarification needed] Accessory items range from shoes to scarves to jewelry and belts.[12] The focus of each seasonal assortment ranges from everyday basics, to wear-to-work, to fashion in monochromatic black, white, and related shades with "seasonal color splashes".[13]
Soma[edit]
Soma was launched by Chico's FAS in 2004.[2] The brand primarily sells lingerie, sleepwear and beauty products. The brand also offers dresses and loungewear. Lines with "slimming solutions" include loungewear, swimwear and corsetry.[14]

History[edit]
1972–1990[edit]
Founders Marvin and Helene Gralnick, met in 1972 while living in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 1983, they opened a tiny Mexican folk art gift shop in Periwinkle Place on Sanibel Island, Florida.[4] Helene named the shop Folk Art Specialties and then changed the name to Chico's Folk Art Specialties after a friend’s pet parrot, Chico.[4] The store sold mostly art, but the sweaters in the store outsold everything else, so Chico's Folk Art Specialties transformed into a clothing boutique.[2][4]
In 1985, Chico's Folk Art Specialties opened a second boutique on Captiva Island, Florida. All early boutiques were infused with Mexican folk art combined with antiques and fixtures manufactured in Marvin’s in-house woodshop.[2][4]
In the beginning, Marvin and Helene would not close the store until they reached a certain amount of sales each day. They also could not afford to have bags printed, so the name was handwritten on each bag.[2]
The first franchise store opened in Edina, Minnesota in 1987. In 1989, the company shortened its name to Chico's FAS (an abbreviation for Folk Art Specialties) and launched the Passport Loyalty Rewards program.[2]
1991–2000[edit]
In 1991, Chico's FAS expanded into cities ranging from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Newport, Rhode Island. By 1992, the company operated 60 boutiques and began designing its own prints and patterns.[2]
Chico's FAS went public in 1993 and began trading on NASDAQ under the title CHCS. It premiered its Most Amazing Personal Service (MAPS) customer service initiative in 1998. Between 1998 and 2000, Chico's sales increased an average of 50 percent per year.[2][4]
In 1999, Chico's FAS began online sales at Chicos.com in 1999. It also began advertising in national magazines, including Martha Stewart Living and Marie Claire.[2]
2001–2010[edit]
In 2001, the Chico's FAS Founders building opened in Fort Myers, Florida, and Chico's FAS debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.[2][4]
Chico's FAS aired its first commercial in six major markets on The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The Oprah Winfrey Show, and on Martha Stewart Living.[2]
Average new store sales reached $1.45 million per year in 2003. The next year, Chico's FAS acquired White House | Black Market, a women’s clothing company that focuses on white, black, and other variants of the two colors. Chico's FAS also launched Soma, an intimate apparel boutique.[2]
In 2006, Chico's FAS added 24 acres to the Fort Myers campus to support growth and stock reached a high of $49.40.[2]
2011–present[edit]
In 2011, Chico's FAS acquired Boston Proper, which is a brand available online or by catalog.[5] Two years later, Boston Proper opened its first boutique at Coconut Point in Estero, Florida.[2]
As of January 2014[update], Chico's FAS Inc was accused, by a Florida-based handbag designer, in a lawsuit of forcing the designer "to copy other designers’ creations."[6]
In 2013, Chico's FAS expanded internationally by opening White House | Black Market stores in Canada.[7] On May 13, 2014, Chico's FAS announced expansion of the Chico's brand into Canada.[8] Three boutiques have since opened in Canada.[1] Further international expansion has occurred with its namesake Chico's into Mexico in 2014. Through an exclusive franchise with El Puerto de Liverpool ("Liverpool"), Chico's opened a stand-alone boutique at Perisur Mall, Mexico City. Plans for further Chico's expansion into Mexico include more openings of stand-alone boutiques as well as branded shop-in-shops in Liverpool department stores.[8]

Chico's primarily sells private branded clothing for women, with a focus on jackets, statement jewelry and clothing with bold prints and patterns.[9] The brand has its own unique sizing that runs from 000-4.5.[10]

The White House | Black Market brand began in 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland and was acquired by Chico's FAS in 2003.[11] It primarily offers exclusively designed, private label women’s clothing and accessory items with a "boutique feel".[clarification needed] Accessory items range from shoes to scarves to jewelry and belts.[12] The focus of each seasonal assortment ranges from everyday basics, to wear-to-work, to fashion in monochromatic black, white, and related shades with "seasonal color splashes".[13]
