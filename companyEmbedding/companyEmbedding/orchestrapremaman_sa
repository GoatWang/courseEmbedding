Will Destination Maternity be Orchestra Premaman's final destination? - Destination Maternity Corporation (NASDAQ:DEST) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Will Destination Maternity be Orchestra Premaman's final destination?Jul. 5.17 | About: Destination Maternity (DEST) Munger Fan Value, long-term horizonSummaryAnalysis of financial covenants show that Orchestra is in near financial distress condition.Destination is too weak to survive by itself and should have no objection towards the merger despite Orchestra's bad results.Orchestra is in trouble whether it does or doesn't go through with the merger. Going through may be more preferable due to growth possibility.By now, most concerned readers already have a full understanding of the "arbitrage opportunity" presented by Orchestra Premaman and Destination Maternity (DEST). Some have claimed that the market was just plain wrong in pricing such a large spread between the two companies and perhaps they are right. But it seems that the market was somewhat accurate in predicting the extreme volatility and uncertainty in the retail industry where the quarterly change in results can mean the difference between life and death. It seems that rather than a merger arbitrage opportunity, Destination Maternity has morphed into a partial bet on the future of maternity/baby clothing retail, a bet on the desire of Orchestra to pursue this combination and a bet on their ability to avert a credit disaster. They are far more difficult questions to answer. Financial analysis The original financial projections for the combined company in December was supposed to be $76 million in combined Adjusted EBITDA. They actually use the Adjusted EBITDA before other charges figure and as you can see, there's a steep decrease from just under $23 million for Destiny's results to just over $16 million for its LTM Q1 2017 results. With about $38 million in net debt, Destiny trades at a roughly 2.33x leverage ratio. This is a pretty hefty deterioration from 1.65x leverage ratio in just one year's time. 


 Source: Orchestra Premaman investor presentation 

 Source: Author's own work According to Orchestra's presentation 3.00x is their covenant for the leverage ratio, <1.25x for gearing, and >5.00x for interest coverage. For FY 2016, Orchestra had gross operating income of 37.4 million Euros which is a good proxy for EBITDA according to their own filings and presentations. I don't have the specific calculations because I don't read French, but I believe the English disclosures are enough to give us a rough idea. With a net debt of 111.5 million Euros for debt covenant purposes, the leverage ratio is 2.98x. Too close to comfort it seems. The gearing ratio of 0.82x with shareholders' equity of 135.8 million Euros to 111.5 million in net debt. This is actually a sizable improvement from FY 2015's 1.16x ratio largely due to a sizable capital raise. Interest coverage is also cutting it pretty close at 5.2x and could possibly deteriorate in combination with Destination. So yes, while Orchestra is certainly observing their covenants, they are barely doing so which probably explains why they didn't directly publish their ratio results. Furthermore, it's not exactly clear what the ratios will be when combined with Destination particularly when it comes to interest coverage and the future leverage ratio. Orchestra certainly won't have an easy time negotiating new debt to consolidate the company's liabilities. The good thing is that most of its bond debt is apparently due at a much later than the $36 million in bank debt which can be paid in full with cash will give them time to improve their performance before their maturity. Also, I am unsure as to whether these covenants are attached to the bank debt or the bonds or both. The best case is if they are attached only to the bank debt.
 The worst situation for any investor is to have two poorly performing debt zombies combine together and it's quite possible that this turns out to be such a situation unless Orchestra improves performance quickly and gets their creditors to loosen up the covenants either through negotiations or repayment of covenant loans if that's an option.

 Source: Orchestra Premaman investor presentation Qualitative analysis Orchestra certainly has a pretty impressive track record in terms of growth in the French and certain other international markets as shown in their long-term sales growth. It indicates that the company certainly has some kind of execution skill in their competitive industry where they claim to compete head to head with the likes of fast fashion leaders like Zara and H&M.
 

 Source: Orchestra Premaman investor presentation The main value proposition as far as I understand it is that there will eventually be a $15 - 20 million annual savings from the combination as a result of reducing unnecessary supply chain expenses in Destination's business that's expected to be achieved within 3 years of closing the merger. Destination also has a current list of over one million annual expecting and new mothers with a historical customer list of over 10 million names. This obviously Orchestra a nice place to start in terms of sales leads and data on potentially profitable locations to open up stores in the U.S. In any other industry, this would probably be considered a brilliant buy. Although in any other industry, you're probably not going to get companies priced like this. In any case, there are other synergies that they claim to benefit from such as cross selling one another's offerings and using a store within a store concept, but I'm skeptical about the material effects those will have on the bottom line and perhaps more so of my ability to understand the retail business. Successfully executing and achieving the first two synergies will go beyond both the market's and my own expectations far enough. To summarize Orchestra's strategy, it's to leverage cost savings from Destination and their own supply chain through the reduction of SG&A while gaining bargain power against their suppliers, increase their product offering by cross selling each other's products in stores, and using Destination's customer list to start Orchestra's U.S. expansion off with a bang. The management factor Orchestra's largest shareholder Yeled Invest SA owns roughly 68% of the company. They also own about 13.7% of Destination so they are extremely vested in Orchestra's survival and somewhat vested in Destination. They will undoubtedly want to cut the deal off if it is better for Orchestra chances of survival. Orchestra has already expended 3.5 million Euros in one off transaction expenses in 2016 alone and pulling back from the merger will subject them to further costs and more importantly, expose them to litigation. Both parties have already committed much time and effort into this and it might be too late for Orchestra to escape from this deal without significantly increasing its odds of filing for bankruptcy. The irony is that going through with the merger may be equally bad for them depending on Destination's near term financial results. Orchestra could be damned if it goes through with it and definitely damned if it doesn't. Destination is probably in significant trouble itself and has no more avenues of organic growth by itself. There is no chance that it will desire to get out of this deal. Bankruptcy is a near certainty if it tries. This is highly reminiscent of SunEdison's (OTCPK:SUNEQ) attempted acquisition of Vivint Solar (VSLR) with Orchestra playing the role of SunEdison and Destination the role of Vivint.
 Perhaps the correct analogy for the current situation is of a car that is racing towards the edge of a cliff hanging off of the ocean. When the driver has regained consciousness, it is already too late to avoid going off of the cliff. He may either try to hit the brakes hard and probably end up crashing into the rocky shallows immediately below the cliffs with guaranteed death or he could choose to accelerate and attempt to launch his vehicle into deeper waters where he may have a chance for survival. To arrest the merger is to attempt hard brakes and to go through with it is to try to accelerate into the deep waters. Conclusion Orchestra has entered into one of the most precarious positions in is entire existence with its own financial performance collapsing as well as that of its merger target. Both are weak by itself and will turn weaker through any attempt to get out of the merger agreement. On the other hand, they have a real chance at survival if they can quickly integrate with one another and quickly implement required synergies. Destination should have no choice but to go through with the merger whereas Orchestra is in roughly the same position. It's likely that this merger will be supported by both companies as long as they can get their creditors to cooperate.

The strategic transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, combines two highly complementary businesses resulting in enhanced capabilities for the benefit of customers, shareholders and employees. The combined company, which is expected to have pro forma revenues of approximately $1.1 billion, will also enjoy greater financial strength and flexibility, with the ability to deliver long-term operating performance and improvements through its increased scale and significant synergy opportunities. 
Under the terms of the Agreement, Destination Maternity ("Destination") shareholders will receive 0.5150 of an Orchestra Prémaman S.A. ("Orchestra") ordinary share, in the form of American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), for each share of Destination common stock they own. The implied offer price of $7.05 per share is based on Orchestra's closing stock price and the EUR/USD exchange ratio on December 19, 2016, representing a 34.0 percent premium to its unaffected stock price of $5.26 on May 31, 2016, prior to Destination filing its 8-K filing on June 1, 2016, announcing Destination change-in-control compensation arrangements. On a pro forma basis, following the closing of the transaction, Destination shareholders will own approximately 28 percent of the combined company, and Orchestra shareholders will own approximately 72 percent. The stock-for-stock transaction is expected to be tax-free to shareholders. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of the required approval of both Destination and Orchestra shareholders. The parties currently expect the transaction to close mid-2017.
Commenting on the merger, Arnaud Ajdler, Destination's Chairman, said, "This highly complementary business combination, which presents compelling value to our shareholders, is a transformative event for both companies. With the creation of one of the world's largest specialty providers of maternity apparel and childrenswear, shareholders of both companies are poised to benefit from a highly diversified product portfolio, improved financial strength and flexibility, and greater distribution and sourcing capabilities. Likewise, consumers will benefit from a significantly expanded product offering that will meet their maternity and early childhood needs made available across multiple channels. With similar cultures and customers, we believe this transaction will enhance our competitive position and open up new avenues of growth for our respective brands in the United States, Europe, and beyond."
Pierre Mestre, Orchestra's Founder and Chairman, stated, "We are excited to bring together two companies that share a common vision to make innovative, fashionable and practical maternity goods and childrenswear available to the masses. The commonality in our target customers will drive incremental market penetration, marketing and cost efficiencies, and revenue growth. Orchestra and Destination will achieve greater growth and earnings together than they each could stand-alone. We are confident this merger will allow us to better compete in the rapidly changing retail landscape, benefiting our collective stakeholders over the long-term. We are excited to welcome Destination's accomplished executives and associates to the Orchestra family."
Summary of Strategic Benefits
The merger of Destination and Orchestra is expected to create numerous significant operational and financial benefits, including:

Enhanced Offerings, Product Portfolio and Customer Connectivity: By merging global leaders across maternity in the U.S. and childrenswear in Europe, the combined company will be able to offer its customers a comprehensive array of premier apparel and other products for the maternity, childrenswear and baby hard good markets. Orchestra allows Destination to dramatically grow the lifetime value of Destination's customer base by extending its customer relationship from months into years. A unified retail strategy focused on customer connectivity will enable expectant mothers and new moms alike to access an exceptional stable of brands through multiple distribution channels and geographies. 
Significant Sourcing Savings: The combined company is also expected to benefit from significant annual cost savings of $15-20 million from leveraging Orchestra's highly efficient direct sourcing network with over 15 years of experience, which includes over 200 people on the ground in 6 buying offices. 
International Growth Platform: Destination's state-of-the-art retail distribution infrastructure and network of U.S. retail locations provides a platform to facilitate Orchestra's entrance into the world's largest and most profitable children's market. Conversely, Orchestra has a global footprint of 560+ stores that primarily span across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Existing stores and new locations throughout the region, along with entry into new markets, provide ample opportunity for international expansion and cross-selling of Destination's product lines. 
Stronger Financial Profile and Meaningful Accretion: In addition to creating a global leader across maternity and children's products, the transaction will enable the combined company to enjoy enhanced top line growth, a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow from diversified revenue streams. Including preliminary run-rate synergy estimates, the transaction is expected to be accretive to both margins and EPS.
Leadership and Organization
Following the closing, the combined company will have an eleven person board, including three independent directors designated by Destination, two additional independent directors, and one employee representative as required by French law. Mr. Mestre will serve as Chairman of the group. The group will be organized geographically, with a North America business unit and a Rest of World business unit. The two business units will leverage each other's product and operational expertise and resources whenever possible. 
Upon completion of the merger, the group, operated under the Orchestra name, will maintain its corporate headquarters located in Montpellier, France. Destination will maintain its headquarters in Moorestown, N.J. and its distribution facility in Florence, N.J.
Orchestra intends to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the registration of the ADSs. Orchestra's ordinary shares will continue to be listed on Euronext Paris stock exchange.
