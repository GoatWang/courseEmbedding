The new musical adaptation of “Groundhog Day,” currently wrapping up its critically adored premiere at the Old Vic in London, has set plans for Broadway, lining up an April opening at the August Wilson Theater.
Reuniting several members of the creative team of “Matilda,” “Groundhog Day” could well cast a long shadow over the 2016-17 Broadway season. The buzzy show, which has already earned a big thumbs-up from the New York Times’ Broadway critic, looks poised to become a significant player during awards season, should response in the States prove as strong it did in London.

No casting for the Broadway incarnation has yet been announced, but Andy Karl, the American stage veteran (“Rocky,” “Legally Blonde”) who won raves in London for his turn in the Bill Murray role, seems a sure bet to lead the New York run. He plays a jaded weatherman stuck in a timeloop in the musical comedy from composer-lyricist Tim Minchin, director Matthew Warchus, choreographer Peter Darling and set and costume designer Rob Howell — all collaborators on “Matilda” — as well as book writer Danny Rubin, who wrote the screenplay to the 1993 film on which the show is based.







“Groundhog Day” lands in a Broadway season that also includes new musicals “Dear Evan Hansen,” “Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812,” “A Bronx Tale,” “Holiday Inn,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Anastasia.” The newest addition to the slate found its New York berth after longrunner “Jersey Boys,” the current occupant of the August Wilson, announced it would close in January.
“Groundhog Day” opens on Broadway April 17, with a start date for previews still to be set. Warchus and Andre Ptaszynski (for Whistle Pig) and Lia Vollack (for Columbia Live Stage) produce.

Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and a book by Danny Rubin. Based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis, the musical made its world premiere try-out at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and opened at the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway on 17 April 2017. The plot centres around Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman[1] who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,[2] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.[3]

Background[edit]
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

Swing / Hot Dog Vendor *
Matthew Malthouse
Kevin Bernard


* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and a book by Danny Rubin. Based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis, the musical made its world premiere try-out at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and opened at the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway on 17 April 2017. The plot centres around Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman[1] who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,[2] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.[3]

Background[edit]
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and a book by Danny Rubin. Based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis, the musical made its world premiere try-out at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and opened at the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway on 17 April 2017. The plot centres around Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman[1] who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,[2] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.[3]

Background[edit]
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

Swing / Hot Dog Vendor *
Matthew Malthouse
Kevin Bernard


* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and a book by Danny Rubin. Based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis, the musical made its world premiere try-out at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and opened at the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway on 17 April 2017. The plot centres around Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman[1] who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,[2] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.[3]

Background[edit]
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

Swing / Hot Dog Vendor *
Matthew Malthouse
Kevin Bernard


* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

Groundhog Day is a musical comedy with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, and a book by Danny Rubin. Based on the 1993 film of the same name written by Rubin and Harold Ramis, the musical made its world premiere try-out at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and opened at the August Wilson Theatre on Broadway on 17 April 2017. The plot centres around Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman[1] who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,[2] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again.[3]

Background[edit]
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day.[4] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts.[5] In 2006 it was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[6] It was voted at number 8 in the top ten greatest films in the fantasy genre by the American Film Institute.[7]
In August 2003, Stephen Sondheim, when asked what his next project might be, said that he was interested in the idea of a musical adaption of Groundhog Day.[8] However, in a 2008 live chat, he said that "to make a musical of Groundhog Day would be to gild the lily. It cannot be improved."[9] In 2009, during an interview with MTV News, Harold Ramis revealed that Danny Rubin was working on the book for a musical version of the film.[10] Rubin affirmed he had been working on a concept of a Groundhog Day musical for some time, and already had about 12 song ideas (whittled down from 30) along with dialog, scenes, and other production aspects. Around 2012, Rubin had become stuck and felt it impossible he could make the musical happen as he believed he could not progress without the collaboration of a composer.[11] Shortly after reaching this conclusion, Rubin was called by director Matthew Warchus to introduce him to Tim Minchin, who had just finished writing the songs for Matilda the Musical. Rubin felt Minchin's work in Matilda proved he "can write songs that are funny and moving and smart and beautiful", and the three started working on adapting Rubin's book.[11]
The trio formally announced their partnership towards the musical in January 2014.[12] A workshop was held in London on 12 July, and Minchin performed a song from the show, "Seeing You", during his concerts at KOKO (December 2013), Hyde Park (July 2014), the steps at Sydney Opera House (February 2015).[13]
On 2 April 2015, the musical was officially confirmed and it was announced that the show would receive its Broadway premiere in March 2017.[14] It was later announced the musical would make its world premiere during 2016[15] at The Old Vic theatre in London,[16] as part of director Matthew Warchus' debut season as artistic director of the theatre.[17]
The musical has a book by Danny Rubin, based on his and Harold Ramis's original screenplay,[18] and is directed by Matthew Warchus,[19] with choreography by Peter Darling[20] and design by Rob Howell.[21] The show features an original score and lyrics by Australian comedian and lyricist Tim Minchin.[22] The production reunites most of the creative team behind the 2010 musical Matilda.[23]
Speaking about the musical, director Warchus said that it's "a show full of intellect, integrity and wit, insight, humor—and of course romance."[24] Minchin, who wrote the music and lyrics for the adaption, added, "Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different" and that "The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags."[25]
Productions[edit]
The Old Vic, London (2016)[edit]
The show's premiere production was scheduled to begin previews at the The Old Vic in London, on 11 July 2016, with its official opening night coming on 16 August, booking for a limited period until 17 September 2016,[26] with an extra performance added on 19 September 2016.
Initial previews were cancelled due to the technical complexities of the show, with the intention to restart on 15 July.[27] The first preview became an open final dress rehearsal with previews beginning instead on 16 July. Tickets went on general sale on 12 April 2016, with priority booking from 10 March.[28] In January 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl would play the lead role of Phil.[29] Other notable casting for the show includes Carlyss Peer as Rita and Eugene McCoy as Larry.[30] The running time for the London production at The Old Vic was 2 hours and 25 minutes (including an interval of 20 minutes).
On 8 June, Tim Minchin performed the musical's finale number "Seeing You" with cast members Jack Shalloo (Ralph), Carolyn Maitland (Joelle), Georgina Hagen (Nancy) and Kieran Jae (Freddie) as backup singers with other musicians at The South Bank Sky Arts Awards at the Savoy Hotel in London. Minchin also performed the song solo with the BBC Concert Orchestra at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park on Saturday 10 September with a selection of songs from Matilda.
The production was nominated for 8 Laurence Olivier Awards. On 9 April 2017, it won the Olivier Awards for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for Andy Karl (accepted by Georgina Hagen as Karl could not attend due to appearing in the Broadway production). At the ceremony, Minchin performed a song from the show "Hope" with some of the London cast and the BBC Concert Orchestra and revealed that the musical would return to London in early 2018.
Broadway (2017)[edit]
The musical had been scheduled to transfer to Broadway, opening on 9 March 2017, following previews from 23 January 2017.[31] However, Playbill reported on June 22, 2016 that the musical "may not make it to Broadway in January 2017" because the lead producer, Scott Rudin has withdrawn from the production.[32]
After the opening night of the production at The Old Vic in London, The New York Times revealed that the production is still intended to transfer to Broadway, produced by André Ptaszynski and Lia Vollack with Whistle Pig and Columbia Live Stage.[33]
The musical premiered on Broadway at the August Wilson Theatre officially on 17 April 2017.[34] On October 19, 2016, it was announced that Andy Karl will reprise his role from the London production as Phil Connors with tickets going on sale from 2 November 2016. Previews will begin 16 March 2017. The full cast was announced in December 2016, which included Barrett Doss as Rita.[35]
The first scheduled preview on 16 March 2017, had to be stopped to technical difficulties with the revolving stage after approximately 15 minutes into the performance. However, the director Matthew Warchus decided that the performance would continue as a concert-style for the rest of act one, with a sing through of 6 songs after intermission using no technical components.[36][37] The second preview on 17 March continued as planned.
On the preview of the evening of 14 April, Karl injured himself onstage during the number 'Philanthropy' tearing his anterior cruciate ligament but he continued the performance with a cane. As a result the matinee on 15 April was cancelled to allow his understudy Andrew Call (who usually plays Gus) to rehearse for the evening performance.[38] Despite his injury, Karl returned for the production's opening night on 17 April, receiving high praise among the reviews. He is set to perform four performances in the week commencing 17 April to recover from his injury.[39]
On 21 April, Andie MacDowell (Rita from the 1993 film of Groundhog Day) attended the performance, meeting Karl, Doss and the cast backstage afterwards.[40][41]
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Phil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to do a report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow signifying an end to winter and the start of spring ("There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place ("Small Town, U.S.A."). When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter ("Punxsutawney Phil"). While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and he confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with an obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson ("Small Town, U.S.A."). Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony again which has the same result as the day before ("Punxsutawney Phil") and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior ("February 2nd/There Will Be Sun"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and fearing a mental breakdown, consults every doctor and healer in town, none of which are medically qualified, who suggest a variety of ridiculous remedies ("Stuck"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and live every day just the same as the day before. The trio take advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks and evade cops before they are caught and Phil is arrested ("Nobody Cares"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 with a newfound skip in his step as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he tricks into sleeping with him ("Philandering"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever meet a man who can live up to her intense specifications, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for some idealized future ("One Day"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and smashes his alarm clock.
Act II[edit]
Act Two opens at yet another Groundhog Day Ceremony as Nancy Taylor contemplates her behavior patterns and how she presents herself ("Playing Nancy"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up ("Hope") that he will one day successfully commit suicide. Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her ("Everything About You"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes ("If I Had My Time Again"). That evening Rita goes to the B&B to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep first ("Everything About You (Reprise)"). The next morning, Phil wakes on February 2 alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself by learning piano ("Philosopher"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died and later that evening Phil finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable ("Night Will Come"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople ("Philanthropy"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band ("Punxsutawney Rock"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like ("Seeing You"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita, starting with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on February 3 ("Dawn").

Swing / Hot Dog Vendor *
Matthew Malthouse
Kevin Bernard


* Matthew Malthouse covered the role of the Hot Dog Vendor as part of his Swing track in the London production. The role has been renamed for the Broadway production, but according to cast members' social media, Kevin Bernard is still considered part of the Swing Team for the production.[48]
The Dance Captain and Assistant Dance Captain for the Old Vic production were Leanne Pinder and Damien Poole, respectively. For the Broadway Production, Camden Gonzales will be the Dance Captain while Michael Fatica will be the Assistant Dance Captain.
Three members of the original cast at the Old Vic have also appeared in Matilda. Matthew Malthouse played Rudolpho/the Escapologist in the world premiere cast at the RSC in December 2010 and reprised his role as the Escapologist in the original West End cast a year later, while Antonio Magro appeared in the West End production as Children's Entertainer/Sergei, during which time he also understudied the principal role of Miss Trunchbull.[49][50] Leanne Pinder was a swing in both the West End and Broadway productions (she also took on the roles of resident and assistant choreographer, respectively).[51]
Critical reception[edit]
The original London production was received positively, opening to a string of five-star reviews.[52]
The Broadway production also received mostly positive reviews, particularly praising Andy Karl for returning to the production despite his earlier injury.[53]

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 33 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
