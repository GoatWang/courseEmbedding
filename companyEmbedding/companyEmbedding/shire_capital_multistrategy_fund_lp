Objective

            The Fund seeks maximum total return, consistent with prudent investment management.
        
Primary Portfolio

            Underlying PIMCO Funds, PIMCO exchange-traded funds and may also invest in unaffiliated funds, fixed-income instruments, equity securities and other instruments
        



























Overview






Fund Overview
An “all-in-one” liquid alternative strategy
PIMCO Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund invests across the full suite of PIMCO’s liquid alternative strategies as it targets attractive risk-adjusted returns through various market environments, while potentially limiting portfolio downside during large corrections in equity or bond markets.
Why Invest In This Fund
Allocated across a broad opportunity set
The fund actively allocates across a range of PIMCO’s liquid alternative mutual funds, including absolute return fixed income, equity long/short, equity market neutral and managed futures strategies. The fund also has the ability to directly invest in individual securities to gain exposure to liquid alternative strategies not offered as standalone mutual funds or to manage overall portfolio risks.
Diversification potential
The fund provides investors with dynamically managed exposure to a wide range of independent liquid alternative strategies in a single mutual fund with daily liquidity. Importantly, the fund seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with substantially lower volatility and downside potential relative to stocks, while seeking to provide important diversification benefits to a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds.
Liquid alternatives leader
PIMCO has one of the longest track records managing liquid alternative strategies in the industry and is among the largest providers of liquid alternatives by assets under management. Through a single investment in the fund, investors gain access to PIMCO’s extensive platform and global presence, the deep expertise of our sector specialists, and the firm’s 40+ years of active management expertise across asset classes.
Our Expertise
The fund is managed by Josh Davis, executive vice president and member of the Quantitative Portfolios Group, Mihir Worah, CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation, and Mohsen Fahmi, managing director and generalist portfolio manager. The portfolio managers work closely together to evaluate strategies for inclusion in the fund and collaborate on all major risk allocation decisions.

High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market NAV as of 






Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.


Money Market funds are not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other government agency and although such funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in Money Market funds.

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved.

Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:

 
The Fund invests in other funds and performance is subject to underlying investment weightings which will vary.  The cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing in a fund that invests directly in individual stocks and bonds. Absolute return portfolios may not fully participate in strong positive market rallies. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. Commodities contain heightened risk including market, political, regulatory, and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks, such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
