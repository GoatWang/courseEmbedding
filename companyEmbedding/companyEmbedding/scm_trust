Importance of Trust
in Supply Chain Management


One of the most critical
factors in a committed and collaborative relationship between supply
chain partners is trust. If trust is present, it can improve the
chances of a successful supply chain relationship; if not, transaction
costs can rise through poor performance. 

Organizations need trust in order to be flexible and agile. However,
establishing trust can be elusive and even harder to maintain. It is
also true that trust is both individual and institutional. Trust in a
supply chain evolves based upon commonalities among the partners and
can take patience and time to develop.

There is both risk and interdependence in a supply chain relationship
and there must be an implicit agreement not to exploit the partner’s
vulnerabilities. This takes development, honesty and openness to be
successful.

In fact, the main components in trust in supply chains are honesty,
loyalty, fairness, openness and competence.

Companies must be careful to “optimize” this trust as it can take
resources from other aspects of the supply chain (and risks) to develop
this. So they must be careful not to over or under invest in developing
trust. The value of the specific relationship must first be made clear
so that it can be determined what effort will be
put forth in developing this trust.

It is apparent that trust only exists when both parties think it
exists, that it is critical to treat supply chain partners like they
are important, information needs to be shared freely, and that partners
need to follow through with promises made.

We are utilizing procurement, inventory and warehouse management to seamlessly integrate our entire process from requisition creation to issuing inventory and vendor payment and on to recording financial transactions. Oracle SCM has given us a robust platform to do all of this faster and more accurately. ProsManages multiple locations and business unitsManages a large volume of vendors and productsIntegrates with other systemsConsMore flexible and presentable dashboards.Easier management of item attachments.Likelihood to Recommend8.0Oracle SCM is well suited for companies who wish to integrate and or automate their entire supply chain business process. The system delivers the most value when all of the various roles involved are working in the system to deliver a seamless operations flow with integrated approvals to move things along quickly. It is great at managing multiple locations and units within the company. Oracle SCM is less ideal for customers looking to adopt only small pieces or single modules within SCM. In this case the investment would outweigh the benefits. from Ryan Payne's Full Review (3 More Sections)Oracle SCM Rating SummaryOverall Rating (19)7.4Likelihood to Recommend (1)8.0Oracle SCM DescriptionOracle SCM from the E-Business Suite family of applications is a broad suite of products for automating processes throughout the supply chain.Categories:  Supply Chain ManagementOracle SCM Technical DetailsOperating Systems: UnspecifiedMobile Application:NoAlternatives to Oracle SCMHost Analytics+CompareBrand Embassy+CompareEnterpriseIQ+CompareLLamasoft Supply Chain Guru+CompareWorkfront+CompareCompare Oracle SCM to ...More InformationOracle SCM  Product DetailsAlternatives to Oracle SCMAll Supply Chain Management SoftwareAbout UsFor VendorsTerms of UseSecurityPrivacyTwitterBlogLinkedIn™© Copyright 2013-2017 TrustRadiusSupply Chain Management Software Overview | TrustRadiusAre You a Tech Marketer?HomeSupply Chain Management SoftwareSupply Chain Management SoftwareFollowing Follow CategoryOverviewListingsReviewsOverviewListingsReviewsFollowing Follow CategorySupply Chain Management Software OverviewWhat is Supply Chain Management Software (SCMS)?
Supply
Chain
Management Software (SCMS) solutions are generally not
single applications, but rather suites of integrated applications and
modules organized around a central platform, presenting a rather
wide breadth of features to meet the needs of larger enterprises.
SCMS is used to automate and—with inbuilt analytics—optimize the
process of managing supply and demand, ordering and
procurement, warehouse operations and distribution,
and the logistical processes and
networks of these enterprises, along with all the regulatory
issues this may entail. They are inventory management platforms with
long arms, so to speak, including software for transportation &
logistics, omnichannel retail, and (optionally) product lifecycle
management and manufacturing. Also, because successful product
delivery depends upon collaboration with many vertical-bound and
fiercely competing supply partners, SCMS presents vendor
relationship and supply chain integrity management, as well as 3PL
or carrier management. SCM vs. ERP: A Familiar LeaderboardIt is
unsurprising, given the breadth, scale, and nature of SCM
application suites, that the top software companies in this
space are the ERP vendors: SAP and Oracle dominate the field,
raking in many hundreds of millions more in revenue than their nearest
competitors, with Epicor and Infor making respectable showings.
There are a few supply chain software specialists that are also quite
popular—JDA Software Group and Manhattan Associates, notably.
One
prominent vendor, Descartes Systems Group, focuses on logistics, offering route
planning and their logistics network software with document
management capabilities. These features aim to reduce some of the complexity
and headache inherent in managing a global supply
chain's customs and regulatory compliance problems and
roadblocks. Components of Supply Chain Management Software SuitesDemand Management and Supply Responsiveness
Demand
management, one of the inward-looking capabilities inherent in Supply
Chain Management, is basically analysis of sales, customer
and order data to improve inventory
control via forecasting. Key benefits include: intelligent and
responsive procurement and resupply, better resource allocation, and
a reduction in costly oversupply of inventory.Distribution, Transportation, and Logistics
This outward
looking element helps to optimize both cost and customer
satisfaction, and is of chief concern to enterprises with global
supply chains or larger businesses with many disparate locations
and warehouses, and with many potential logistical partners and carriers to
choose from. The success of the external element of supply chain
management depends on an agile network of partners and collaboration and global
trade management. Leading SCMS supports  transportation management (managing freight
and carriers) and logistics networks (route optimization, rate analysis, and
shipping performance for customer satisfaction). Warehouse Management & Inventory Management
Also
offered as standalone software for SMBs retailers and eCommerce-heavy
businesses, warehouse management software automates warehouse operations
internally as the name implies, but it is more than stocking items
healthily and safely in neat boxes on climate controlled shelves. This
component also monitors and manages stock across warehouses and distribution
networks to optimize order fulfillment while controlling costs. For vast
supply chains the process is inexorably logistical as well, and it is an
inherent component of all SCMs. Vendor Management, Supply Chain Integrity, and Product Lifecycle Management
Global
supply chains involve many product development and logistical partners. Leading
SCM software vendors appreciate the needs of global
enterprises that sell complex
products while maintaining strict industry standards (e.g.
pharmaceutical companies) by including vendor management and
product lifecycle oversight, monitoring, and vendor scoring (or vendor chastening
in the case of counterfeiters or substandard suppliers). All of these
capabilities are folded into the SCM suite. Supply Chain
Integrity basically automates the process of avoiding logistical roadblocks, as
well as issues that may compromise product integrity (e.g. counterfeit
products).

Trust in Supply Chain Relationships: What Does It Mean to Trust? - Part I 
 














Published on: Nov, 05, 2003 


by: Rob Handfield
SCRC

One of the most misunderstood and ripe areas for research in the area of supply chain relationships is in the area of trust. Trust (and its cousin, Collaboration) seems to be the single most discussed element in making supply chains function effectively and efficiently. One academic noted that:

		“In both serious social thought and everyday discourse, it is assumed that the meaning of trust and of its many apparent synonyms is so well known that it can be left undefined or to contextual implications.” Barber (1983:7) Hosmer (op cit 380)

This observation is corroborated by the evolution of trust in the fields of industrial economics, organizational behavior, marketing, and organizational theory. Of all the elements critical to managing supply chains, trust is one of the most commonly cited elements, yet one of the most difficult to measure.
A comparison of the various definitions of trust across research disciplines shows that trust can be grouped into six conceptual paradigms shown in the table below.
1. Reliability – Time and experience are critical elements in evaluating trust (Rossiter and Pearch 1975, Deutsch 1958, Rotter 1967, Gambetta 1988, Fairholm 1994, Lorenz 1988, Zucker 1995, Lewis 1990, Gulati 1995, Good 1988)
2. Competence – Experience and wisdom displayed by partner (Ghoshal and Bartlett 1994, Luhmann 1988, Butler 1991)
3A. Goodwill (openness) – Confidence you can share information or problems with the other party (Pennings and Woiceshyn 1987, Granovetter 1985, Johnson Georges & Swap 1982, Ring and Van de Ven 1994)
3B. Goodwill (benevolence) – Accepted duty to protect the rights of your partner (Farris et al.. 1973, Hart et al.. 1986, Mayer et al… 1995, Barber 1983, Rempel & Holmes 1986, Butler 1991, Hosmer 1995)
4. Vulnerability – Being unprotected or exposed while including an element of uncertainty or risk (Deutsch 1958, Akerlof 1970, Barney & Hansen 1994, Klein, Crawford & Alchian 1978, Zand 1972, Holmstrom 1979, Sabel 1993, Lorenz 1988, Gambetta 1988)
5. Loyalty – A partner is not just reliable but performs well in extraordinary situations ( Rempel & Holmes 1986, Larson 1990, Friedland 1990)
6. Multiple Forms of Trust – There are more than one type of trust (McAllister 1993, Mishra 1996, Gabarro 1979, Bromiley & Cummings 1996, Rempel & Holmes 1986, Ghoshal & Bartlett 1995)
In paradigm one, authors posit that trust is a cognitive predictability or reliability of another party. The second paradigm addresses the competence of a party as a component of trust. In the third paradigm, a recognition of trust as an altruistic faith or goodwill felt toward another party is proposed. The fourth paradigm relates the concept of vulnerability to trust. Paradigm number five specifies that loyalty-based trust exists when a partner consistently goes beyond the call of duty. The sixth conceptual paradigm realizes that multiple components of trust exist, which are defined by cognitive (reliability or task) trust and affective (altruistic) faith trust. Through this three-part series, we will identify and discuss each of these representative paradigms that are drawn from the marketing, organization theory, sourcing, and organization behavior literature streams.
Reliability
Reliability can be broken down into several elements. Reliability is dependent on prior contact with a party or experience. Repeated interaction and time leads to levels of confidence, consistency and finally trust. Reliability then leads to predictability which is confidence in future actions. While reliability is important, what motivates reliability is often more important. Reliability must be based on integrity or honesty to be effective. Reliability based coercion or stress eventually creates a suboptimal relationship or total breakdown.
A series of definitions define trust in terms of a firm or person’s reliability or expectation of performance. Deutsch (1958) created one of the first definitions of trust which accepted the extreme position that for trust to be present, expected loss must be greater than expected gain. Authors after Deutsch extended trust as an expectation to include situations where expected gain are greater than loss. Reliability can often be confused with predictability. Reliability primarily addresses a party’s past behavior while predictability actually takes past behavior and other information to address probabilities of future performance. Reliability and predictability are closely related terms and definitions addressing either term fall into this body of theory. Firms or people who meet a threshold level of predictability can by definition be trusted. This paradigm is best described by the following definition:

		Trust is a range of observable behaviors and a cognitive state that encompasses predictability (Rossiter and Pearch 1975).

What this means in simple terms is that trust is not something that occurs overnight, but is built up over time through repeated interactions and acts of good faith. For example, a long-term customer relationship may be based on a continuous discussion of problems that occur and are resolved over time. I recall at a meeting between a senior VP of purchasing and a senior VP of marketing from two companies with a ten year history of a solid business relationship. The VP of marketing noted that the reason the relationship worked, is that “Whenever there was a problem or conflict, I was able to march over to his office, shut the door, lay it out on the table, and work it out! Sometimes it took a few hours, but when I came out, we both 
felt better about the situation.”

Compiled by Thomas Wailgum and Ben WorthenEditor's Note: This article was updated on Nov. 20, 2008, to reflect changes in supply chain management technology.What is supply chain management?Supply chain management (SCM) is the combination of art and science that goes into improving the way your company finds the raw components it needs to make a product or service and deliver it to customers. The following are five basic components of SCM.1. Plan—This is the strategic portion of SCM. Companies need a strategy for managing all the resources that go toward meeting customer demand for their product or service. A big piece of SCM planning is developing a set of metrics to monitor the supply chain so that it is efficient, costs less and delivers high quality and value to customers. 2. Source—Next, companies must choose suppliers to deliver the goods and services they need to create their product. Therefore, supply chain managers must develop a set of pricing, delivery and payment processes with suppliers and create metrics for monitoring and improving the relationships. And then, SCM managers can put together processes for managing their goods and services inventory, including receiving and verifying shipments, transferring them to the manufacturing facilities and authorizing supplier payments.3. Make—This is the manufacturing step. Supply chain managers schedule the activities necessary for production, testing, packaging and preparation for delivery. This is the most metric-intensive portion of the supply chain—one where companies are able to measure quality levels, production output and worker productivity.4. Deliver—This is the part that many SCM insiders refer to as logistics, where companies coordinate the receipt of orders from customers, develop a network of warehouses, pick carriers to get products to customers and set up an invoicing system to receive payments.5. Return—This can be a problematic part of the supply chain for many companies. Supply chain planners have to create a responsive and flexible network for receiving defective and excess products back from their customers and supporting customers who have problems with delivered products.. For a more detailed outline of these steps, check out the nonprofit Supply-Chain Council's website.What does supply chain management software do?Supply chain management software is possibly the most fractured group of software applications on the planet. Each of the five major supply chain steps previously outlined is comprised of dozens of specific tasks, many of which have their own specific software. Some vendors have assembled many of these different chunks of software together under a single roof, but no one has a complete package that is right for every company. For example, most companies need to track demand, supply, manufacturing status, logistics (i.e. where things are in the supply chain), and distribution. They also need to share data with supply chain partners at an ever increasing rate. While products from large ERP vendors like SAP's Advanced Planner and Optimizer (APO) can perform many or all of these tasks, because each industry's supply chain has a unique set of challenges, many companies decide to go with targeted best of breed products instead, even if some integration is an inevitable consequence.It's worth mentioning that the old adage about systems only being as good as the information that they contain applies doubly to SCM. If the information entered into a demand forecasting application is not accurate, then you will get an inaccurate forecast. Similarly, if employees bypass the supply chain systems and try to manage things manually (using the fax machine or spreadsheets), then even the most expensive systems will provide an incomplete picture of what is happening in a company's supply chain.What is the relationship between ERP, CRM and SCM?Many SCM applications are reliant upon the kind of information that is stored inside enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and, in some cases, to some customer relationship management (CRM) packages. Theoretically a company could assemble the information it needs to feed the SCM applications from legacy systems (for most companies this means Excel spreadsheets spread out all over the place), but it can be nightmarish to try to get that information flowing on a fast, reliable basis from all the areas of the company. ERP is the battering ram that integrates all that information in a single application, and SCM applications benefit from having a single major source to go to for up-to-date information. Most CIOs who have tried to install SCM applications say they are glad they did ERP first. They call the ERP projects "putting your information house in order." Of course, ERP is expensive and difficult, so you may want to explore ways to feed your SCM applications the information they need without doing ERP first. These days, most ERP vendors have SCM modules, so doing an ERP project may be a way to kill two birds with one stone. In addition, the rise and importance of CRM systems inside companies today puts even more pressure on a company to integrate all of its enterprisewide software packages. Companies will need to decide if these products meet their needs or if they need a more specialized system.Applications that simply automate the logistics aspects of SCM are less dependent upon gathering information from around the company, so they tend to be independent of the ERP decision. But chances are, companies will need to have these applications communicate with ERP in some fashion. It's important to pay attention to the software's ability to integrate with the Internet and with ERP applications because the Internet will drive demand for integrated information. For example, if a company wants to build a private website for communicating with their customers and suppliers, the company will want to pull information from ERP and supply chain applications together to present updated information about orders, payments, manufacturing status and delivery.What is the goal of installing supply chain management software?Before the Internet came along, the aspirations of supply chain software devotees were limited to improving their ability to predict demand from customers and make their own supply chains run more smoothly. But the cheap, ubiquitous nature of the Internet, along with its simple, universally accepted communication standards, have thrown things wide open. Now, companies can connect their supply chain with the supply chains of their suppliers and customers together in a single vast network that optimizes costs and opportunities for everyone involved. This was the reason for the B2B explosion; the idea that everyone a company does business with could be connected together into one big happy, cooperative family.Of course, reality isn't quite that happy and cooperative. But today most companies share at least some data with their supply chain partners. The goal of these projects is greater supply chain visibility. The supply chain in most industries is like a big card game: the players don't want to show their cards because they don't trust anyone else with the information, but if they showed their hands they could all benefit. Suppliers wouldn't have to guess how many raw materials to order, and manufacturers wouldn't have to order more than they need from suppliers to make sure they have enough on hand if demand for their products unexpectedly increases. And retailers would have fewer empty shelves if they shared the information they had about sales of a manufacturer's product in all their stores with the manufacturer. The Internet makes showing your hand to others possible, but centuries of distrust and lack of coordination within industries make it difficult.During the last few years most companies have gotten over the trust issue. In many cases "gotten over" is a euphemism for "have been bullied into sharing supply chain information from a dominant industry player." Want to sell your goods in Wal-Mart? Better be prepared to share data and adhere to Wal-Mart's data-exchange standards. (For more on this topic, see "How Wal-Mart Lost Its Technology Edge.")The payoff of timely and accurate supply chain information is the ability to make or ship only as much of a product as there is a market for. This is the practice known as just-in-time manufacturing, and it allows companies to reduce the amount of inventory that they keep. This can cut costs substantially, since you no longer need to pay to produce and store excess goods. But many companies and their supply chain partners have a long way to go before that level of supply chain flexibility can be achieved.What is supply chain collaboration?Let's look at consumer-packaged goods for an example of collaboration. If there are two companies that have made supply chain a household word, they are Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble. Before these two companies started collaborating back in the '80s, retailers shared very little information with manufacturers. But then the two giants built a software system that hooked P&G up to Wal-Mart's distribution centers. When P&G's products run low at the distribution centers, the system sends an automatic alert to P&G to ship more. In some cases, the system communicates down to the individual Wal-Mart store, allowing P&G monitor the shelves through real-time satellite link-ups that send messages to the factory whenever a P&G item swoops past a scanner at the register. Within the last couple of years, the relationship has expanded to include radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies to gain even more insight into ridding inefficiencies in the supply chain.With this kind of minute-to-minute information, P&G knows when to make, ship and display more products at the Wal-Mart stores. There's no need to keep products piled up in warehouses awaiting Wal-Mart's call. Invoicing and payments happen automatically too. The system saves P&G so much in time, reduced inventory and lower order-processing costs that it can afford to give Wal-Mart "low, everyday prices" without putting itself out of business. (For more on Wal-Mart's supply chain, see "How Wal-Mart Lost Its Technology Edge.")What are the roadblocks to installing supply chain software?Gaining trust from your suppliers and partners.Supply chain automation is uniquely difficult because its complexity extends beyond a company's walls. Employees will need to change the way they work and so will the people from each supplier that a company adds to its network. Only the largest and most powerful manufacturers or retailers (i.e. Wal-Mart) can force such radical changes down suppliers' and partners' throats. Most companies have to sell outsiders on the system. Moreover, one company's goals in installing the system may be threatening to their suppliers, to say the least. For example, Wal-Mart's collaboration with P&G meant that P&G would assume more responsibility for inventory management, something retailers have traditionally done on their own. Wal-Mart had the clout to demand this from P&G, but it also gave P&G something in return—better information about Wal-Mart's product demand, which helped P&G manufacture its products more efficiently. In order for a company to get its supply chain partners to agree to collaborate, business leaders and supplier relations managers have to be willing to compromise and help partners achieve their own goals.Internal resistance to change.If selling supply chain systems is difficult on the outside, it isn't much easier inside. Operations people are accustomed to dealing with phone calls, faxes, spreadsheets or hunches scrawled on paper, and will most likely want to keep it that way. If management can't convince front-line operations people that using the software will be worth their time, they will easily find ways to work around it. Senior executives cannot disconnect the telephones and fax machines just because they have supply chain software in place.Many mistakes at first.
