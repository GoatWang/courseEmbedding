Novocure News










the story of Novocure
In 2000, our founder Professor Yoram Palti sought to leverage his expertise in biophysics to develop a new way to treat cancer that would destroy tumor cells while sparing healthy tissue and avoiding many of the life-altering side effects of existing cancer therapies. Novocure has grown into an international oncology company with more than 450 employees and operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Publication Date: November 24, 2009

 Venture capitalist William Doyle must raise $35 million for a portfolio company with a promising, novel cancer therapy, just as global capital markets are imploding in the fall of 2008. NovoCure, Ltd., has developed an electrical-field-based therapy, called Tumor Treating fields, for the treatment of cancerous tumors. The therapy has shown significant efficacy with no side effects after five years of testing in human patients. Doyle believes NovoCure has the potential to become an important company with a major new cancer therapy platform, but must complete pivotal (Phase III) clinical trials and receive FDA approval. Doyle's venture capital firm, WFD Ventures, has invested $25 million in three rounds to fund pilot clinical trials for glioblastoma and other non-small cell lung cancer, and the first pivotal clinical trial for glioblastoma. Additional financing is needed to proceed with the strategically important second pivotal trial. In the fall of 2008 Doyle was negotiating the final terms of an investment by two prominent hedge funds when the liquidity crisis caused the hedge funds to withdraw from the transaction. Doyle must now reevaluate his options for securing the needed financing for this promising young company.
