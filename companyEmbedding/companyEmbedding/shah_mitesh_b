Mitesh's Profile


Mitesh is a commercial litigator with over a decade of success representing individuals and companies across the United States. He represents Fortune 500 companies and high-net worth individuals in high stakes litigation.  Over the years, he has successfully defended insurance companies, energy companies, airlines, manufacturers, physicians and pharmaceutical companies in class actions, wrongful death actions and business disputes. Recently, Mitesh was appointed as a Deputy Attorney General to represent the State of Alabama in a litigation matter. A seasoned negotiator, Mitesh has also recovered millions of dollars when representing his clients as the plaintiff in litigation. He is one of the youngest members of the Firm to be included in the The Best Lawyers in America©  a ranking he has earned consistently since 2013. His skills as a litigator are also recognized by Benchmark Litigation® and Super Lawyers®. Prior to joining Maynard Cooper, Mitesh served as federal law clerk to the Honorable James H. Hancock.
Along with his active litigation practice, Mitesh currently chairs the Business Advisory Board for Southern Research, a global research and development organization that has led the market in developing drugs for cystic fibrosis and cancer, and a leading engineering, energy and environmental research organization. Mitesh is the president-elect of the Alabama India Business Partnership (AIBP), an organization that actively works to increase investment between Indian and Alabama based corporations. 
Mitesh serves on the firm's Executive committee.
 





Mitesh's Experience


Mitesh serves as lead Alabama counsel for a Fortune 250 energy company in mass tort litigation involving 1000 plaintiffs alleging personal injury from exposure to natural gas odorant. After years of discovery, Mitesh presented oral argument on summary judgment for five (5) different defendants in the matter and secured a dismissal for each defendant from the trial court.
Mitesh was a member of the trial team representing a Fortune 50 chemical company against lawsuits filed in Alabama and West Virginia. The plaintiffs were thousands of coal miners who alleged respiratory injury from exposure to isocynate-containing products used in the coal mines to prevent roof collapses and improve ventilation. The cases were favorably resolved in September 2010 after pre-trial motions and jury selection in Alabama.
Mitesh served as lead Alabama counsel for a Fortune 50 medical product distributor in a wrongful death action related to medication error. After negotiations with Plaintiffs counsel and limited discovery, Mitesh secured a voluntary dismissal and a significant reduction in litigation costs and potential liability exposure.
Mitesh represented one of the nation's largest airlines in the first “toxic fume“ case filed against a commercial airliner. The case involved passengers alleging exposure to tricresyl phosphate during a flight on a commercial aircraft. The plaintiffs allege that TCP was introduced into the cabin from the cabin's bleed air system and exposure has caused respiratory and neurological injuries. The case was favorably resolved.
As lead counsel, Mitesh has secured summary judgment in multiple matters in state and federal Courts for the nation's largest retail distributor of diesel fuel and oil products.
Mitesh was co-lead counsel for litigation involving a failed acquisition of a mutual fund. After 10 months of litigation, and the deposition of numerous executives and the former CEO, the matter was successfully resolved and the client received a seven-figure settlement.

Attorneys

Trial Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Consumer Protection Lawyers: Consumer protection is linked to the idea of consumer rights, and to the formation of consumer organizations, which help consumers make better choices in the marketplace and get help with consumer complaints. Other organizations that promote consumer protection include government organizations and self-regulating business organizations such as consumer protection agencies and organizations, ombudsmen, the Federal Trade Commission in America, and Better Business Bureaus in America and Canada, etc.
