Neat Products







Neat�s core travel distribution technology is known as Neat DCSTM (Distribution Control System) and is comprised of three key applications:
NeatSourceTM, the real-time �control room� application for Neat DCS technology, which allows suppliers to better manage distribution channels and reduce distribution costs.
NeatAgentTM, the application that enables traditional travel agents to electronically create travel packages (E-PacksTM) utilizing merchant model retail pricing, sell these E-Packs to customers in a call center or walk-up environment, and receive their distributor fees automatically via the ARC settlement system.
NeatOnlineTM, the B2C Internet booking interface which allows distributors and travel agents to distribute E-Packs directly to consumers via their Internet sites.
Neat DCS technology has been designed and rigorously tested to ensure compliance with industry-leading business practices and technical standards. The technology uses intricate algorithms and business rules to create E-Packs according to supplier and distributor needs in real-time.  The technology is highly scalable and can handle large transaction volumes without compromising performance or simplicity of use. Furthermore, the system offers superior security and product reliability.  Neat's technology is compatible with industry standard computer reservation and financial settlement systems, thus greatly simplifying integration and implementation.
Neat has multiple patents pending on its core Neat DCSTM technology and satellite applications.

Whether what matters to you is your business, your family, or your dreams, what matters to us is helping you be more efficient so you can find time for the things you love.






What Do We Do?
Neat makes scanners and software that help you easily organize your documents, manage your expenses, and so much more. We help our users to:






Get control
of important information by quickly capturing documents 	and making them organized, searchable, and at hand when they’re needed.





Work more efficiently
by unlocking information to easily use for reports, share with others, and feed to other programs.





Gain time
by offering a better system for document and expense management, helping users unleash a better way to work and be more productive.








How Did We Get Here?
Neat was born from a single idea: that there’s a better way to deal with receipts for expense reports. Over time, the idea has grown and changed into something much more powerful: a way to transform and manage any digital or paper document, with live data you can use.
Since 2002, Neat has been synonymous with digitizing and organizing data, particularly from receipts and business cards. Over the past few years, we’ve added new document types, integrated our scanning technology into other applications, created our powerful cloud-based technology, and even completely revamped our product line with new hardware and software to help you lead an organized, digitized life.






Interested In Working For Neat?
Neat is a mixture of seasoned professionals and dynamic young leaders that together create a unique blend of experience and energy. Our employees combine humor with humility in a highly collaborative, open-office environment geared towards creative problem-solving and rapid decision-making.
We offer competitive salaries, health benefits, a 401(k) savings program, ample time off, room for growth, and a lot of laughter.
