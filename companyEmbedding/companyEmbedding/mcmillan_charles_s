Qualifications:

Mr. McMillan has had significant operational experience leading a major international consumer products company, where he has gained expertise in finance, strategy, regulatory matters, marketing, manufacturing, mergers and acquisitions and human resources, and has had primary responsibility for risk management. These skills assist him in providing oversight of and guidance to our executive team in their management of a complex multi-national company. His understanding of the food industry enables him to provide valuable insights in our strategic planning and evaluation of our products. In addition, his past service on five other public company boards, including as a member of the audit and finance committees, and his current service as a board leadership fellow for the National Association of Corporate Directors, has given him additional expertise related to governance, finance, commodities, regulatory matters and business challenges for research and development-focused companies. This experience is beneficial in his service on our board, our executive, audit and finance and nominating and corporate governance committees and as chair of our people and compensation committee.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Missouri joined Arkansas on Friday in banning the use and sale of the weed killer dicamba after a rise in complaints that the agricultural chemical is drifting into neighboring fields and damaging crops, the states agriculture departments said on Friday. Dicamba use and complaints about its use have spiked in the past two years in the United States.

BASF will consider buying seed assets that rivals are putting on the block to win antitrust approval for tie-ups, saying bargain prices could persuade BASF to overcome its traditional reluctance to expand into the seeds industry. "There are assets that will come to market for antitrust reasons and they might come at prices that are different from those that we have seen in the past.

Higher soybean plantings in the U.S. this spring boosted biotech seed giant Monsanto Co.' s quarterly profit, despite the broader slump in agricultural commodity prices. Farmers this year have dedicated more acres to soybeans after a string of record-breaking harvests have eroded the price of widely grown crops like corn and wheat. Soybean prices had fared better due to strong demand from China and elsewhere, though prices have declined as farmers ramped up planting.
