 Career History

                                    Current                


Miami University


                  Miami University is one of the oldest public universities in the country, made possible by an ordinance signed by President George Washington in 1795. Chartered in 1809, Miami welcomed its first students in 1824. Miami's reputation grew as quickly as its enrollment, and it became known as the "Yale of the West" for its ambitious liberal arts curriculum. Today, Miami consistently ranks among the nation's top public universities for the quality of teaching and overall student experience.

One of Miami University's most famous graduates was Benjamin Harrison, who later became a President of the United States. Professor William Holmes McGuffey revolutionized the education of generations of Americans when he conducted research for his Eclectic Readers series while teaching at Miami from 1826 to 1836. The "mother of fraternities," Miami was the founding site of four national fraternities: Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Tau; as well as Delta Zeta sorority.

Miami University - Farmer School of Business


                  Located in a state-of-the-art, LEED certified facility, The Farmer School of Business is proud to offer one of the world's best undergraduate business educations.

    An emphasis on experiential learning, international study, and leadership development;
    A strong entrepreneurship program, ranked 16th among undergraduate entrepreneurship programs by The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine;
    An ever-expanding network of relationships with business and organizational leaders, which enables us to bring outstanding speakers to campus;
    Active recruitment of our students by several hundred employers, who also value our students as interns. Within six months of graduation, 98 percent of the Class of 2012 was employed full time or enrolled full time in graduate school.

I was just thinking about Mr. Saunders tonight and I decided to look him up. Very sad to hear he passed. I had him for Earth and Space Science class my freshman year 1991. He was an intelligent guy with a great respect for science and a great respect for the kids.. but also tough, and really funny. One time in class he had the words "Happy Winter Solstice" written in chalk on the blackboard. Well somebody was acting up

I was just thinking about Mr. Saunders tonight and I decided to look him up. Very sad to hear he passed. I had him for Earth and Space Science class my freshman year 1991. He was an intelligent guy with a great respect for science and a great respect for the kids.. but also tough, and really funny. One time in class he had the words "Happy Winter Solstice" written in chalk on the blackboard. Well somebody was acting up at the beginning of class, and Mr. Saunders had to go into drill sergeant mode which was both frightening and entertaining at the same time. So he laid down the law very loudly to the misbehaving student as Mr. Saunders would do. And the whole time Joe Gusky and I couldn't help but notice the festive "Happy Winter Solstice" sign written on the blackboard. And there is no way he didn't see us trying not to laugh. He was done saying what he had to say, the room was so quiet.  And he looked our way and said, in a very calm friendly voice... "Oh, by the way guys.. Happy Winter Solstice!" Definitely one of the funniest moments in school. RIP Mr. Saunders, my respect to his family

One of the reasons I enjoyed class so much was because of this man. A great teacher who truly cared about his students and his school. Thank You Mr. Saunders.

Our deepest sympathy for the loss of Mr. Saunders.  He was a wonderful person, teacher and coach to many of us at Carlynton High School.   We were hoping that he would have attended our 40th Class Reunion in July 2016.  You will truly be missed!!Carlynton Class of '76

My deepest sympathy for the loss of Don, he was my 9th grade science teacher and my football coach (graduated in 1982). I had the opportunity to see him several times over the years and we always talked and caught up..he was a true class act and played a major role in my life through high school..He had the same impact on many people I know..He was a good man...

I had the honor of playing for Coach Saunders when he was the head coach of the Carlynton Football Program.  I want to thank him for making me the best player I could be and for leading our team to some of the best years in the history of that school district.  But, more importantly I want to thank him for providing me with important life lessons that have stuck with me my entire life.  Thank you Coach Saunders for teaching me that in football as well as life we must always give 100% effort on every play, and that no matter what the next play is the most important play.  You have impacted my life and every player who ever had the privilege to call you Coach!  Thank You!

You could not ask for a better neighbor. He treated our children almost like they were his own grandchildren, and he looked out for all of his neighbors. A true gentleman and an absolute pleasure to know. We were honored to spend the time we did with you Don, and I still owe you that tree!

Home Office Desks

Home office desks have been specifically designed for the unique demands of the home office. More and more people are telecommuting or working from home these days. But it's just as important to stay organized at home as it is at a commercial office. Home office desks are an ideal solution. Read More

Create a luxurious office space with room to spare by opting for a large home office desk. A corner l shape home office desk offers the ideal work environment: plenty of room for your computer work as well as that pile of paperwork. To help things run smoothly, our selection of home office desks offer all the bells and whistles: from CPU shelves to wire management to filing cabinets. 

If your style leans towards country chic, try a beautiful oak home office desk. Dark wood colors like espresso or cherry are always popular choices for home office desks while the clean look of a white home office desk is always in vogue. 

We carry home office desk options from all the major office furniture brands. Go for an antique-inspired Riverside Furniture home office desk option or try the sleek and modern look of a Kathy Ireland by Bush Furniture home office desk instead.

Get Organized with a Student Desk

Student desks are an essential office furniture item for students of all ages. Whether you have a child in primary school or a teen heading off to college, Cymax has a great student desk at the right price. Creating a comfortable work area helps to make study time go more smoothly. Read More
What to Look for in a Desk

A student workstation is a hardworking piece of furniture.  While these desks tend to be small, it's smart to choose one that can accommodate your computer and printer, as well as any other peripherals you might need. 
Small Student Desks

Student desks tend to be small in order to fit into small spaces, like a bedroom or college dorm room. If your child is still quite small, you might want to consider a child sized desk that will be a more comfortable fit  for a small body. 
If you are short on space or are looking for a solution for an awkward space, corner student desks are a great choice. An L shape student desk is another smart choice, that allows plenty of room for a computer as well as for spreading out projects and writing. 
Stylish & Cheap Student Desks

Storage is a huge priority for any small space. Choosing a student desk with plenty of drawers is one clever way to maximize your space. If you have lots of papers to organize, go for a student desk with a filing cabinet drawer. Look for extras like keyboard trays or wire management systems to keep your workspace clean and tidy. To make the very most of your space, why not consider a unit with an attached hutch or bookcase? These units take advantage of your vertical space without putting holes in the wall like a wall mounted bookshelf. 
Whether you are looking for cheap student desks or you are splashing out on something fancy, our extensive desk selection will have something for you.  Student desks in a mix of metal and glass are a popular choice for a modern space. But go wild and choose student desks with a traditional wooden finish like cherry or oak for a more classic feel. A dark wood finish like black or espresso is perfect for a small student dorm room or for bedroom. Count on antique white student desks to keep things feeling fresh and clean. No matter what you choose, be sure to choose a comfortable desk chair to ensure a great study experience.
Discount Student Desks & More

Cymax offers competitive pricing on furniture for your home and office. Cymax proudly offers a large array of affordable student desks from all the best manufacturers including Sauder and Nexera. With discount prices and free shipping on most items, every purchase is a bargain.
