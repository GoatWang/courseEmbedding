Goals[edit]
The goals of product life cycle management (PLM) are to reduce time to market, improve product quality, reduce prototyping costs, identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions, and reduce environmental impacts at end-of-life. To create successful new products the company must understand its customers, markets and competitors. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise. PLM solutions help organizations overcome the increased complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets.[citation needed]
Product life cycle[edit]
The concept of product life cycle (PLC) concerns the life of a product in the market with respect to business/commercial costs and sales measures. The product life cycle proceeds through multiple phases, involves many professional disciplines, and requires many skills, tools and processes. PLC management makes the following three assumptions:[citation needed]

Products have a limited life and thus every product has a life cycle.
Product sales pass through distinct stages, each posing different challenges, opportunities, and problems to the seller.
Products require different marketing, financing, manufacturing, purchasing, and human resource strategies in each life cycle stage.

Once the product is designed and put into the market, the offering should be managed efficiently for the buyers to get value from it. Before entering into any market complete analysis is carried out by the industry for both external and internal factors including the laws and regulations, environment, economics, cultural values and market needs. Product life cycle is guanine concept and this term ‘product life cycle’ is associated with every product that exists, however, due to a limited shelf life the product has to expire. From the business perspective, as a good business, the product needs to be sold before it finishes its life. In terms of profitability, expiry may jolt the overall profitability of the business therefore there are few strategies, which are practiced to ensure that the product is sold within the defined period of maturity.
Extending the product life cycle[edit]
Extending the product life cycle by improving sales, this can be done through

Advertising: Its purpose is to get additional audience and potential customers.


Exploring and expanding to new markets: By conducting market research and offering the product (or some adapted form of it) to new markets, it is possible to get more customers.


Price reduction: Many customers are attracted by price cuts and discount tags.


Adding new features: Adding value to the product catches the attention of many buyers.


Packaging: New, attractive, useful or eco-friendly packaging influence the target customers.


Changing customer consumption habits: Promoting new trends of consumption can increase the number of customers.


Special promotions: Raising interest by offering Jackpot and other offers.


Heightening interest: Many of the following things attract many customers who match certain profiles: Eco-friendly production processes, good work conditions, funding the efforts of non-profit organizations (cancer cure, anti-war efforts, refugees, GLTBI, environment and animal protection, etc.) and the like.

Something important to notice is that all these techniques rely on advertising to become known. Advertising needs the others to target other potential customers and not the same over and over again.[1]
Characteristics of PLC stages[edit]
There are the following major product life cycle stages:


Stage
Characteristics


1. Market introduction stage
This is the stage in which the product has been introduced first time in the market and the sales of the product starts to grow slowly and gradually and the profit received from the product is nominal and non-attained. The market for the product is not competitive initially and also the company spends initially on the advertisement and uses various other tools for promotion in order to motivate and produce awareness among the consumers, therefore generating discerning demands for particular brand. The products start to gain distribution as the product is initially new in the market and in this stage the quality of the product is not assured and the price of the product will also be determined as low or high.[2]

costs are very high
slow sales volumes to start
little or no competition
demand has to be created
customers have to be prompted to try the product
makes little money at this stage




2. Growth stage
In the growth stage, the product is present already in the market and the consumers of the products are habitual of the product and also there is quick growth in the product sales as more new and new customers are using and trying and are becoming aware of the product. The customers are becoming satisfied from the product and they bought it again and again. The ratio of the product repetition for the trial procurement risen and also at this level, the competitors have started to overflow the market with more appealing and attractive inventions. This helps in creating increased competition in the market and also results in decreasing the product price.

costs reduced due to economies of scale
sales volume increases significantly
profitability begins to rise
public awareness increases
competition begins to increase with a few new players in establishing market
increased competition leads to price decreases




3. Maturity stage
In maturity stage, the cost of the product has been decreased because of the increased volume of the product and the product started to experience the curve effects. Also, more and more competitors have seen to be leaving the market. In this way very few buyers have been left for the product and this results in less sales of the product. The decline of the product and cost of attaining new buyers in this level is more as compare to the resulted profit. The brand or the product differentiation via rebating and discounts in price supports in recalling the outlet distribution. Also, there is a decline in the entire cost of marketing through enhancing the distribution and promotional efficiency with switching brand and segmentation.[3]

costs are decreased as a result of production volumes increasing and experience curve effects
sales volume peaks and market saturation is reached
increase in competitors entering the market
prices tend to drop due to the proliferation of competing products
brand differentiation and feature diversification is emphasized to maintain or increase market share
industrial profits go down




4. Saturation and decline stage
In this stage, the profit as well as the sales of the product has started to decline because of the deletion of the product from the market. The market for the product in this stage, started to show negative rate of growth and corroding cash flows. The product, at this stage may be kept but there should be less adverts.[4]

costs become counter-optimal
sales volume decline
prices, profitability diminish
profit becomes more a challenge of production/distribution efficiency than increased sales

Note: Product termination is usually not the end of the business cycle, only the end of a single entrant within the larger scope of an ongoing business program.



Identifying PLC stages[edit]
Identifying the stage of a product is an art more than a science, but it's possible to find patterns in some of the general product features at each stage. Identifying product stages when the product is in transition is very difficult.[citation needed]

Job Details
               The University of Virginia was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson. The cornerstone of the University's first building was laid in 1817, with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe in attendance. The first class entered the university in 1825, and the first degree was conferred in 1828. Today the University of Virginia offers ten schools to its students. The University has a student population of 20,399, which consists of 13,401 undergraduates, 4,699 graduate students, 1,694 first-professional students (law and medicine), and 605 on-Grounds Continuing Education students. The University of Virginia will unveil its new world-class squash facility on Sept. 19, and the sport's elite ranks have begun lining up to offer their seals of approval. The $12.4 million McArthur Squash Center at the Boar's Head Sports Club opened its doors in April, but the 33,000-square-foot venue will mark its formal debut with a Grand Opening Festival of Squash, to be held Sept. 19 through 22. A ribbon-cutting ceremony and presentations by University officials and the center's primary donor, Jaffray Woodriff, will launch the festival. The event will include five simultaneous professional and amateur tournaments, highlighting the state-of-the-art facility's draw as both a spectator venue for elite-level competition and as a magnet for squash players of all levels. The squash facility is operated for U.Va. by the Boar's Head resort, a subsidiary of the University of Virginia Foundation. "The McArthur Squash Center has clearly exceeded our expectations, in terms of its beauty and its function, its layout and how it's going to attract people to the game of squash," said Tim Rose, CEO of the University of Virginia Foundation. "I told my staff when they were working on it, 'Many people will go through life and never have the opportunity to work on something that's considered the best in the world.

Dean Zeithaml specializes in the field of strategic management, with an emphasis on global and competitive strategy. He conducts research on international expansion strategies, knowledge-based sources of competitive advantage, corporate political activity, strategic decision making, the strategic role of the board of directors, the implementation of acquisition and diversification strategies, and organizational transformation. He focuses much of his research agenda on global firms, high-technology industries, the energy industry, and the health care industry.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Annys Shin  By Annys Shin   June 19, 2012  Follow @AnnysWaPo     He was an insider who nearly everyone could line up behind, known for his long tenure and big ideas. The appointment of longtime University of Virginia dean Carl P. Zeithaml on Tuesday as the school’s interim president surprised many inside and outside the university. But those familiar with Zeithaml, including rivals at other schools, say the 62-year-old strategic management expert is well-equipped to step in and lead a campus that is still reeling from the abrupt ouster of his predecessor, Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan resigned June 10 after two years on the job, citing “a philosophical difference of opinion” with some members of the school’s Board of Visitors. Rector Helen E. Dragas had criticized Sullivan for moving too slowly to address “an existential threat” facing the university as a result of the sluggish economy and declining state support. In contrast to Sullivan, who had no prior ties to the university, Zeithaml is well known to faculty, administrators and governing board members. He came to Charlottesville in 1997 to become dean of the McIntire School of Commerce, the university’s undergraduate business program, a job he still holds. He is one of the the longest-serving deans at U-Va. During his tenure, he has made a name for himself as an innovator and someone who has tackled ­ever-present funding challenges by creating new programs. One of his earliest and best-known accomplishments was a makeover of the undergraduate business curriculum. He put more emphasis on real-world experiences, having students work in teams on problems facing actual businesses and make presentations to corporate executives. That approach helped McIntire land at the top of Businessweek’s rankings of undergraduate business programs, which began in 2006. Last year, McIntire was ranked second, after the University of Notre Dame. It has also occupied the top spot in the past. “He was critical in moving McIntire up the rankings,” said Norean Sharpe, undergraduate dean of the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, which was 10th last year in the Businessweek rankings. Sharpe earned a doctorate at U-Va. and her daughter recently received a masters in commerce from McIntire, one of several new degree programs Zeithaml helped create that have brought in revenue for the school. To help finance some of McIntire’s core undergraduate classes, Zeithaml helped line up corporate sponsors, such as Rolls-Royce and Major League Baseball. He is also known as a prolific fundraiser, a skill some governing board members found lacking in Sullivan. He helped secure funding for McIntire’s current home, a $58 million state-of-the-art addition that opened in 2007. The board’s handling of Sullivan’s departure sparked protests on campus, and angered the faculty senate, which, in turn, called for Dragas and several other board members to resign. Vice Rector Mark Kington, an Alexandria businessman who was a key player in Sullivan’s ouster, stepped down yesterday. Many in Charlottesville see Zeithaml’s selection as an attempt by the board to restore a sense of stability after a week of tumult. His term as interim president is slated to begin Aug. 16. Zeithaml, who is married and lives in Charlottesville, was traveling Tuesday and not available for comment. In a university news release, he said, “I realize that it is a very difficult time for many people within our community, but I look forward to working with our faculty, students, staff, alumni and University leaders to move U.-Va. forward.” Zeithaml’s most recent feat of financial engineering was persuading the administration to charge McIntire students a few thousand dollars a year more, a practice known as “differential tuition.” The higher cost has not hurt demand. Applications are up, said Jim Travisano, McIntire’s assistant dean of communications. Zeithaml is known as someone who doesn’t forget a name, and who is good at getting people to work together. Sharpe said in her encounters with him, he has been open and willing to share strengths and weaknesses of programs, a quality she said has likely helped him hold the same job for so long. Being dean of a undergraduate business program, Sharpe said, “is very stressful, very hard, and very political.” “He is a very savvy strategist,” said McIntire senior associate dean Richard Netemeyer. Prior to his appointment yesterday, Zeithaml had never expressed interest in the job of U-Va. president, colleagues said, nor has he said he wants the job permanently. It is unclear how many contenders there were for interim president. The board spoke with Edward Miller, the dean and chief executive of the medical faculty at Johns Hopkins, according to the Baltimore Sun. It appointed Zeithaml after 11 hours of closed-door meetings. He won the vote of every member but one, Heywood Fralin, who said in a statement released Tuesday that his vote had ”nothing to do with my opinion of Carl Zeithaml’s leadership abilities.” Having served on two search committees with Zeithaml, Fralin said he regards him as “an extraordinary and capable leader,” and that his vote was an indication of his “dissatisfaction with the process and the decision that lead to the resignation of Terry Sullivan.” Zeithaml came to U-Va. after 11 years at the Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Notre Dame, and holds degrees from the University of Maryland and the University of Florida.          local   Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.
