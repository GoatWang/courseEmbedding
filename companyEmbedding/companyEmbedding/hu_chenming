Chenming Hu   

TSMC 
Distinguished Professor Emeritus,  University
of California, Berkeley
Dr. Chenming Hu has been called the 
Father of 3D 
Transistor
for developing the 

FinFET in 1999.�� Intel is the first company to
use FinFET in 2011 production calling it the most radical shift
in semiconductor technology in over 50 years.�
By 2015 all top servers, computers, Android and ios phones
use FinFET processors. He received the
National Technology and Innovation Medal 
from

President Obama in the White House in 2016. The world's largest technology association IEEE called him "Microelectronics
Visionary"
when presenting him the 2009 Nishizawa Medal for
"achievements critical to producing smaller yet more reliable and
higher-performance integrated circuits".  2011 Asian
American Engineer
of the Year Award cited his industry-standard transistor model "used
in designing IC products with cumulative sales of many hundreds of billions of
dollars".  2013 Kaufman Award noted his "tremendous career of creativity and innovation
that fueled the past four decades of the semiconductor industry".  US
Semiconductor Industry Association lauded
his research leadership for "advancement of the
electronics industry and of our national economy". 

Dr. Hu is Professor in Graduate School of University of California, Berkeley, a board director of 
Ambarella and Inphi and chairman of the nonprofit Friends of Children with Special Needs.�� From 2001 to 2004 he was the Chief
Technology Officer of TSMC, world's largest dedicated integrated circuits
manufacturing company.   He was a board director of Sandisk before its 
merger with Western Digital, the board chairman of the nonprofit
East Bay Chinese School, Oakland, CA. and the founding chairman of
Celestry Design Technologies until its acquisition by Cadence Design Systems. 
He has authored five books
including a 2010 semiconductor device textbook
and 900 research papers, and has been granted over 100 US patents. � He is honored with memberships in three
national academies -- the US National Academy of Engineering, the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and  Academia Sinica -- and in the 
US Academy of Inventors .� His many other professional honors include 
the IEEE Andrew Grove Award for device reliability research and Solid State 
Circuits Award
for the BSIM 
transistor model,  Honorary
Doctoral Degree of National Chiao Tung 
University, SRC Aristotle Award for
influential mentoring of many outstanding students and the IEEE EDS Education Award for 
"distinguished contributions to education and inspiration of students, 
practicing engineers and future educators".   He also
received UC Berkeley's highest honor for teaching
-- the Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award.
Dr. Hu received his B.S. degree from National Taiwan University,
which honored him with the 2011 
Distinguished Alumni
Award, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from  UC Berkeley, all in
electrical engineering.  He is currently researching green transistor
for a new century of growth in electronics.  He shares an interest in painting with his
sons Raymond and Jason.

Features
Two information-packed chapters (CH. 6 & 7) on modern MOSFETs: No other text offers such thorough coverage or so successfully reflects the importance of MOSFET in the IC technology of today and tomorrow. The author offers the most up-to-date information available, including roadblocks and ways to overcome these roadblocks. Some topics include: short-channel effects, leakage currents, velocity saturation, source injection-velocity limit, as well as those important to IC designers such as noise, voltage gain, design for manufacturing, and RF operation. 
 
Timely topics like solar cells and light emitting diode/solid-state lighting: This text offers timely topics of renewable electricity generation and energy conservation using semiconductor devices, integrated into an organized introduction of device concepts with applications beyond energy and power. See Sections 4.12 and 4.13.
 
Interesting topics that break up long passages of text: Long chapters on MOS capacitor and MOSFET that are dense with mathematical theory are broken up with coverage of important devices that are also interesting to students: CMOS imagers, SRAM, DRAM, flash memory, optical devices, and MESFET/HEMT. See Sections 5.10 and 6.16.
 
Liberal use of sidebars to keep student interested and introduce useful information: The author keeps students engaged while presenting topics that are often neglected in other texts like quotations of transistor and IC inventors, excerpts from the earliest MOSFET patents, thermoelectric generator and cooler, hot-carrier reliability, and more. See Sections 1.1, 2.1, 6.16.3, 7.1.

Chenming Hu, Kaufman Award Winner








 

 This year's Kaufman award winner is Chenming Hu. In contrast to previous years, this was presented on the Sunday evening of DAC instead of at a separate event in San Jose. Chenming's career was reviewed by Klaus Schuegraf, Group Vice President of EUV Product Development at Cymer, Inc (now part of ASML) and also one of the (many) students of Dr Hu.One thing that I had no idea about was that Chenming had climbed Everest at the age of 50. That seems pretty much up there (see what I did) with inventing the FinFET. However, Dr Hu's career goes back a long way before the FinFET. He was instrumental in solving hot-electron problems back in the 1um (almost typed nm there, i'm so used to it) era. And then getting through the 3V scaling barrier.But in addition to being the father of the FinFET, he is the father of the BSIM model. This was the first industry standard non-proprietary model and is now used by hundreds of companies (basically almost everyone) and has revolutionized many aspects of circuit simulation, making it more competitive and higher performance.Lip-Bu, CEO of Cadence, briefly spoke. It turns out that Lip-Bu and Chenming are neighbors so they know each other well without the obvious semiconductor connection. Lip-Bu talked about a couple of boards that he is on with Chenming.Chenming then accepted the award from Kathryn Kranen (chairman of EDAC) and Donatella Sciuto (president of IEEE CEDA). He talked briefly about his career. His first professor was Andy Grove so his relationship with Intel certainly goes back a long way. He has had countless students and today over 50 leaders in the industry went through various programs with him.To wrap up, Dr Hu looked forward rather than back. Summarizing the FinFet's possibilities, he said:Great for digitalEven better for analogBetter stability and reliabilityCan be scaled to the end of lithography

EDA Industry to Recognize Dr. Chenming Hu with the Phil Kaufman Award at DAC 2013








 

 NEWS RELEASEEDA Industry to Recognize Dr. Chenming Huwith the Phil Kaufman Award at DAC 2013 Honored For Major Contributions to Transistor Modeling Enabling the Generation of FinFET Based DesignSAN JOSE, California – April 2 2013 – Dr. Chenming Hu, TSMC Distinguished Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley, has been selected by the EDA Consortium (EDAC) and the IEEE Council of EDA (CEDA) as recipient of the 2013 Phil Kaufman Award for Distinguished Contributions to Electronic Design Automation (EDA). He will receive this award at the opening ceremony of the largest EDA event, the Design Automation Conference (DAC) on June 2, 2013 in Austin, Texas.  Dr. Hu is being recognized for his contributions in device physics, device modeling, and device reliability through BSIM and BERT models that have transformed the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic design automation industries. Dr. Hu’s team invented the revolutionary 3D FinFET transistor structure that simultaneously achieves size and power reduction to enable continued scaling of the microelectronic chips. In a professional career spanning four decades, including over thirty years as a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at UC Berkeley, Dr. Hu has advanced semiconductor technologies through his nearly one thousand research publications including four books, led or helped build leading companies in the industry, and trained hundreds of graduate students. His students occupy leadership positions in industry and academia. Dr. Hu received a bachelor degree from National Taiwan University, masters and PhD degrees from UC Berkeley. He has served on the faculty of MIT and UC Berkeley as well as the chief technology officer for TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. He founded Celestry Design Technologies, an EDA company that was later acquired by Cadence Design Systems. He was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering in 1997, the Academia Sinica in 2004, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007. He received the IEEE Andrew S. Grove Award, the Don Pederson Award and the Jun-Ichi Nishizawa Medal for his contributions to MOSFET device, technology and circuit design. Among his many other awards is UC Berkeley’s highest honor for teaching, the Berkeley Distinguished Teaching Award. Dr. Hu served as a board chairman of the nonprofit East Bay Chinese School and currently serves on the board of the nonprofit Friends of Children with Special Needs.In recommending Professor Chenming Hu for the Phil Kaufman Award, the nominator noted a tremendous career of creativity and innovation that fueled the past four decades of the semiconductor industry including the recent adoption of FinFETs by major semiconductor manufacturers, which will propel the industry to its next decade. His students recall him as a great mentor and role model. “The Kaufman Award celebrates Chenming's contributions to the EDA industry for the BSIM compact models widely used to design all types of integrated circuits, spanning logic, memory, analog and RF products.  His technical contributions have profoundly affected directions in device technology as with the FinFET, all aspects of device reliability, and non-volatile memory technology.  His graduates serve in senior leadership positions in industry and academia globally.  Chenming has served in key leadership positions at TSMC and SanDisk.  With this award, the semiconductor industry collectively applauds Chenming's monumental impact,” added this year’s award presenter Klaus Schuegraf, Group Vice President of EUV Product Development at Cymer, Inc. Aart J. de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys, Inc. and EDAC Chairman of the Phil Kaufman Award Selection Committee said, “Recognizing Chenming Hu the very year in which the entire EDA, IP, and Semiconductor industry is unleashing the next decade of IC design through the 16/14nm FinFET generation is not a coincidence, but illustrates how a great contributor can impact an entire industry!”“Professor Hu’s work and life stands as an example of tremendous contributions to science, technology, and society that would make Phil Kaufman proud. IEEE CEDA is a proud partner to EDAC in honoring such a luminary,” said Donatella Sciuto, president of CEDA.Accolades for Chenming Hu“Professor Chenming Hu’s impact on the semiconductor business has been wide and deep,” notes Eli Harari, retired founder, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk.  “He has been actively engaged with key companies in the semiconductor industry, including National Semiconductor, TSMC and San Disk. He is a distinguished device physics researcher and a highly acclaimed educator and role model at UC Berkeley. His considerable technical contributions in MOS device reliability, device modeling, scaling, and FinFET transistors have had a sweeping impact on the semiconductor industry.”       “Professor Hu has pioneered the research on the CMOS device reliability physics, modeling and circuit simulation. Prof. Hu and his BSIM group developed the world’s first and leading industry standard MOSFET compact models, BSIM3 and BSIM4. Since 1997, BSIM has been used by all foundries, EDA firms, fabless design houses/IP companies and most of the integrated device manufacturing companies from 0.25 micron down to 20nm, in addition to 16/14nm FinFET, all together ten technology nodes. Due to the open, accurate and efficient BSIM models, foundries, fabless companies and EDA providers can efficiently develop and enhance device models for each new generation of process nodes,” adds Chi-Foon Chan, President and co-CEO, Synopsys Inc. "Professor Chenming Hu has made some major contributions to the integrated circuit industry, including developing the BSIM compact model and early research on FinFET transistors,” concurs Mark Bohr, Intel Senior Fellow.  “I'm very pleased to see him receive this recognition.” Dado Banatao, Tallwood Venture Capital said, “Chenming is one of the best in microelectronic devices with significant impact in transistor modeling, devices and device physics.” John Y. Chen, VP Technology, NVIDIA Corporation remarks, “Professor Chenming Hu has contributed immensely to EDA tools and FinFET and truly deserves the recognition of the Phil Kaufman Award.”"Under the leadership of Professor Chenming Hu, his group at UC Berkeley developed the BSIM3 and BSIM4 models for use in MOSFET integrated circuit design, made the models public domain and available to the entire world, provided technical support for the models, and continued the development of these models to accommodate many of the non-idealities of MOSFET devices as design rules shrank,” shares Laurence (Larry) Nagel, Author of Spice.  “Without the tireless efforts of Chenming's group, the adoption of advanced CMOS technology nodes would have been slower and more arduous and the pace of MOSFET IC development would have been markedly slower.  I think it is fair to say that more SPICE simulations have employed the BSIM3 and BSIM4 models than all other semiconductor device models combined."“SPICE models lie at the root of all electronic circuit design, and as Director of the Group that provided the industry with BSIM3 and BSIM4, Prof. Hu has contributed to the design of more integrated circuits than any other individual” concludes Colin McAndrew, Director of Modeling at Freescale.About the Phil Kaufman AwardThe Phil Kaufman Award honors individuals who have had demonstrable impact on the field of EDA through technology innovations, education/mentoring, business or industry leaderships. The award was established as a tribute to Phil Kaufman, the late industry pioneer who turned innovative technologies into commercial businesses that have benefited electronic designers. Last year’s recipient was C. L. (David) Liu, former president of the National Tsing Hua University for his contributions to algorithmic EDA.About the EDA ConsortiumThe EDA Consortium is the international association of companies that provide design tools and services that enable engineers to create the world’s electronic products used for communications, computer, space technology, medical, automotive, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics markets among others.
