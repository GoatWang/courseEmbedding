The Best Gift of All is the Story of Tradition




Harris Made proudly designs finest bespoke handmade recognition gifts that are unique to your institution.
For more than 300 years our mills and tannery have been weaving the timeless story of tradition through every fibre, stitch and buckle to offer the very best of British heritage, quality and understated style. For instance, our mill weaves the iconic scarlet uniform fabric for the Queen’s Guard at Buckingham Palace and is the recipient of a Royal Warrant from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the ultimate seal of approval for exquisite quality and service. Our silk is supplied to the bespoke tailors of Savile Row, London, and our brass and nickel comes from the same foundry that casts the hardware for the Queen’s royal carriages.
Isn’t that the detail, and story, those most important to you deserve?





Introducing Mark & Emma Harris, the people who make Harris Made.










The Lost Art of Bespoke




With deep British roots, we founded Harris Made in Lake Forest, Illinois, USA, because you told us of your struggle to source bespoke recognition gifts that are unique to your institution, heirloom quality, gift wrapped with a rich story of tradition, and available in small quantities at reassuringly affordable prices.
Our discerning clients are those who appreciate our discreet ‘less is more’ design philosophy that focuses on quality, value and traditional British handmade craftsmanship.
At Harris Made we weave the most luxurious silk, Saxony wool, Cheviot cloth, tartan, cashmere, linen and select only the finest British vegetable tanned leather and hardware.
There is made, and there is Harris Made.
