Marc has generated sustainable results in leading large global organizations through strategic and operational transformation. Examples include:

Leading multi-functional, global organizations ranging in size from $4 billion to $7.5 billion in sales
Leading three major integrations involving a hostile takeover, a global division carve-out, and a full business absorption. He also has experience with regional acquisitions, divestitures, and a spin-off analysis.

Developing a five-year strategic plan at a $4 billion division that served as a basis for growth. The plan was fully integrated throughout the organization and was instrumental in sales growth outpacing market growth in four out of five years.
Leading development of capabilities at a large healthcare company that led to significant enhancements in global regulatory expertise, improved sales force ratings (rated #1 in US), highest copy test scores in the industry, record new product freshness index, and a decreased new product development launch cycle from 39 to 24 months.
Leading the rollout of SAP throughout Western Europe for the consumer and pharmaceutical divisions of Warner Lambert
