William T. Dillard, who founded the Dillard's department store chain, built it into the nation's third largest and then presided as his stores lost prestige and profits, died yesterday at his home in Little Rock, Ark. He was 87.Mr. Dillard was born Sept. 2, 1914, in Mineral Springs, Ark., the son and grandson of merchants. He started his training in the retailing business at 12, when he went to work for his father, who owned the local general store.After attending the University of Arkansas and Columbia University, where he earned an M.B.A., Mr. Dillard borrowed $8,000 from his father and opened a department store in Nashville, Ark., in 1938 at the height of the Depression.Although it was hardly a propitious time to start a business, Dillard's prospered almost from the start. Mr. Dillard said his philosophy was to focus on giving the customers value and to advertise. In 1948, Mr. Dillard sold the Nashville store and used the money to start creating an empire. He expanded first in Texas and soon had stores all over the South.

In 1964, Mr. Dillard opened a store in Austin, Tex., his first one in a shopping mall, and quickly saw that malls would offer great opportunity to reach rapidly growing suburban populations. As shopping centers blossomed in the 1960's and 1970's, so did Dillard's. The chain now runs 350 stores in 29 states and has roughly $8.5 billion in sales. Continue reading the main story

Mr. Dillard was also visionary in the use of technology, particularly computerized checkout systems that track inventory. ''He was earlier than most in seeing the growth of shopping center retailing,'' said William H. Sutton, a lawyer in Little Rock who has been a director of Dillard's since 1994. ''He insisted on innovation in computer systems.''Although Mr. Dillard was able to exploit computers and malls before other chains, he was determinedly old-fashioned in other ways, something that eventually became a handicap. For example, long after Dillard's had risen to be one of the largest retailers in the nation and sold stock to the public in 1969, Mr. Dillard employed all five of his grown children in senior positions with the chain.

When Mr. Dillard retired as chief executive in 1998, his eldest son, William Dillard II, succeeded him. A second son, Alex Dillard, is president. Two daughters, Drue Corbusier and Denise Mahaffy, and a third son, Mike, also hold titles of vice president and higher.Such an arrangement, unusual for a public company, has been a particular source of criticism from analysts who follow Dillard's because the chain has had more than its fair share of financial woes in recent years. While most retailers had banner sales and earnings in the latter part of the 1990's, Dillard's sales and earnings stagnated by comparison.The stock, which hit a high of $50.38 a share in 1992, traded below $20 a share for much of last year. In addition, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have both reduced the company's credit rating below investment grade.''It is a public company run as a private company,'' said Wayne Hood, a stock analyst for Prudential Securities. ''The earnings slide they have had over the years would have normally caused a replacement of management at many levels, but they control'' the class of company stock, with voting control.In addition to his five children, Mr. Dillard is survived by his wife, Alexa, and 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

Dillard’s, Inc. Holds Store Tour with William Dillard, III | Business Wire
























































Dillard’s, Inc. Holds Store Tour with William Dillard, III






June 04, 2013 01:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dillard’s, Inc. (NYSE:DDS) (the “Company” or “Dillard’s”) conducted a 
      tour of its NorthPark Mall store in Dallas, Texas yesterday. William 
      Dillard, III toured guests through the store, highlighting current 
      strategies following a meet and greet luncheon.
    

      Mr. Dillard provided an overview of the Company’s Internet strategies at 
      dillards.com, its initiatives in the home and furniture area as well as 
      continuing successful strategies in ladies’ accessories and intimate 
      apparel.
    

      Mr. Dillard shared that first quarter sales at dillards.com increased 
      21% over the prior year first quarter and spoke of the Company’s ongoing 
      consideration of how to grow the business effectively, noting the 
      opening of the new Internet Fulfillment Center in Little Rock in the 
      spring of 2012. Mr. Dillard confirmed that, to date, the Company has not 
      offered free shipping on dillards.com.
    

      Mr. Dillard highlighted the company’s successful exclusive brand 
      programs and noted that in 2012 exclusive brands comprised approximately 
      22% of total sales. Specifically, he highlighted the Company’s exclusive 
      brand shoe program which began in partnership with Vince Camuto in the 
      early 2000’s. He spoke of the success of core brands, including Gianni 
      Bini and Antonio Melani, as well as their later extension into handbags 
      and ladies’ apparel. Mr. Dillard noted that the sales penetration of 
      ladies’ exclusive brand shoes is approximately 28%-30% of ladies’ shoes 
      sales.
    

      Mr. Dillard acknowledged that first quarter ending inventory increased 
      3% over the prior year while comparable store sales increased 1%. He 
      pointed to tough comparisons compared to last year’s first quarter with 
      regard to both ending inventory and sales and highlighted progress over 
      a two year period. Additionally, he noted a change in the cadence of 
      markdowns to better match shopper psychology and resulting seasonal 
      buying patterns. The Company continues to refine its markdown strategy 
      in order to improve gross margin performance. Mr. Dillard is pleased 
      with the current inventory composition and noted that the company 
      remains committed to disciplined inventory management.
    

      In the home area, Mr. Dillard highlighted initiatives to update the 
      Company’s mix of home merchandise to a more exciting and contemporary 
      offering as well as the elimination of a historically promotional 
      pricing strategy and a move to a more balanced pricing approach. He 
      noted that while sales in the home and furniture category were down 
      significantly for the first quarter, gross margin for the category was 
      up significantly.
    

      Mr. Dillard summarized that the key to the Company’s success is 
      capitalizing on successful initiatives and extending them to additional 
      areas of the store, adding that doing a lot of little things right has 
      served the Company well. He thanked guests in attendance for their 
      interest in Dillard’s.
    

      Dillard’s, Inc. is one of the nation’s largest fashion apparel and home 
      furnishing retailers. The Company’s stores operate with one name, 
      Dillard’s, and span 29 states. Dillard’s stores offer a broad selection 
      of merchandise, including products sourced and marketed under Dillard’s 
      exclusive brand names. For more information about Dillard’s, Inc. please

Early life[edit]
William T Dillard was born on September 2, 1914, to Thomas J. Dillard and Hattie Mae Gibson Dillard, both grocers.[2] Dillard found employment with Sears & Roebuck Company where he gained experience in retail business.[1] He graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in Business Administration and earned a Master's Degree from Columbia University.[1][2][3] He was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.[1]
Career[edit]
Dillard returned to Arkansas and opened his first retail store in 1938 in the town of Nashville, Arkansas, after he borrowed US$8,000 from his father to sign the lease and install shelves, and stocking those shelves with merchandise supplied on generous credit, extended on the basis of wholesalers' long dealings with his father.[2][3] In 1948, he sold his Nashville store and opened stores in Texas, followed by more stores across the Southern United States.[3] In 1964, he opened his first store in a mall in Austin, Texas, and foreshadowed the boom of malls.[3] In 1965, he opened more stores in malls in Little Rock, Arkansas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.[2] He used computerized checkouts to track inventory.[3] By the turn of the century, Dillard's Department Stores was the third largest department store chain in the United States.[2] He retired in 1998.[1] His eldest son, William T. Dillard II, took over as CEO and his second son, Alex Dillard, as President.[3] His daughter, Drue Corbusier and Denise Mahaffy, and a third son, Mike Dillard, serve as Vice Presidents.[3]
Personal life and death[edit]
Dillard married Alexa Latimer on June 9, 1940, and they had five children.[2] He was an Episcopalian, and a Republican.[1] He died at his home in Little Rock on February 8, 2002, at the age of 87 from heart failure.[1][2][3]

William T. Dillard (1914–2002)








William Thomas Dillard was the founder of Dillard’s, Inc., one of the nation’s largest fashion apparel and home-furnishings retailers. From an $8,000 investment in a single store in Nashville (Howard County), Dillard, an Arkansas native, built a premier retail chain with a national presence of more than 300 stores in twenty-nine states. 
William T. Dillard was born on September 2, 1914, in Mineral Springs (Howard County), the only son of Thomas Dillard and Hattie Gibson Dillard, who were prominent farmers and merchants in the close-knit Mineral Springs community. Retailing excited Dillard from a very young age, and he spent many hours in his father’s store. 
Dillard attended the University of Arkansas (UA) in Fayetteville (Washington County), where he majored in accounting and graduated with a BBA degree in 1935. Later, he attended Columbia University and graduated with an MS in business in 1937. Dillard opened his first store on February 12, 1938, in Nashville under the name T. J. Dillard’s, the same name as his father’s Mineral Springs store. 
Following a five-year courtship, Dillard married Alexa Latimer in Nashville on June 9, 1940. They had five children.
Dillard sold his Nashville store in 1948 and moved his family to Texarkana (Miller County) after purchasing a forty-percent interest in Wooten’s department store. In 1949, he and a group of associates purchased the remaining sixty percent. Dillard’s enormous success with the Texarkana store eventually launched a string of strategic store acquisitions in towns across the South, beginning with Magnolia (Columbia County) in 1955 and extending to Tyler, Texas (1956), and Tulsa, Oklahoma (1960). Dillard moved his family to Tulsa in 1960. 
In 1963, Dillard turned his efforts back to his home state, with the notable acquisition of downtown Little Rock (Pulaski County) store giants Pfeifer’s (1963) and Blass (1964). Dillard moved his family back to Arkansas in 1964, establishing Little Rock as the home base for his rapidly growing company. 
Dillard was quick to recognize the growing trend of the suburban shopping mall as the newest in retail destination shopping. He opened his first mall locations in 1965 in Park Plaza Mall in Little Rock and Southland Shopping Mall in Tulsa. Dillard’s strategy of opportunistically purchasing troubled hometown department stores, combined with entering new suburban malls, became the pattern of the company’s growth for many years to come. Dillard often said that anything about an existing store could be changed except its location. This vision enabled him to turn troubled retailers into huge opportunities for his growing company. 
Dillard’s much-anticipated grand openings were accompanied by legendary fanfare, including promotions, ribbon-cutting celebrations, contests, giveaways, and more. He embraced the hometown newspaper as the best means to reach customers in each of his markets and quickly formed a mutually beneficial partnership in each town in which Dillard’s operated. 
Dillard was not only a pioneer of the suburban shopping mall but also of the use of technology in retailing at a time when most other retail operators viewed computers as mere novelties in the retail environment. Dillard’s success in consolidating and automating functions to create mass efficiencies served as the model for other retailers to study for years to come. 
Dillard won many awards and honors during his lifetime in recognition of his many achievements. In 1999, he was among the first four Arkansas business leaders inducted into the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame. 
Dillard died at the age of eighty-seven on February 8, 2002, in Little Rock. He often said, “Business without integrity is not good business—and in the long run will not be successful.”
