Broadway Prom



























BROADWAY PROM


VOTE HERE

Sunday - October 26th 2014
Bar 13, 35 E 13th St
9:30pm







The 11th annual Broadway Prom
presented by Dani Spieler#bwayprom
$5 cover at the door - partial proceeds benefit the Dizzy Feet Foundation.









Kings






Ben Fankhauser

NEWSIES is closed; but that won’t mean an end to their Prom Court winning streak if Fankhauser has anything to say about it. Can you smell the Keenan-Bolger-made campaign video brewing?






Michael Mahany

Mahany is hoping to be the first ever married man to be elected Prom King. Wife, Sara Andreas, has made him walk around the house in a crown, and only a crown, in preparation for the big night. Can we get a Snapchat up in here?!








Clarke Thorell

Thorell is a Broadway Prom virgin. He’s got 10 years of missed Proms to make up for in 1 night, and he’s ready for the challenge. Be gentle.






Cody Williams

With 2010 Prom Queen Runner-Up, Alysha Umphress, as his campaign manager, Williams is poised to take the title. This sexy sailor will give you 12 pirouettes into an aerial into 15 Russians without even breaking a sweat. We hope to see all of that and more on the dance floor at Prom.









QUEENS






Gaelen Gilliland

Somewhere between finding Neverland and honeymooning in Vegas, Gilliland found the time to secure her Prom Queen nomination. The Nominating Committee is exhausted just thinking about it, but Gilliland just got back from St. Lucia, so she’s relaxed and ready to take the crown.






Lesli Margherita

Margherita has been campaigning for years with her nightclub act “All Hail The Queen.” Voters better be loud for Matilda’s mean Mommy on Prom night. Bow down, bitches.








Kristin Piro

Piro’s got the eye of the tiger and it’s on the crown, hunny. This Jersey girl is a maniac, maniac on the floor; and if she wins, she’ll dance like she’s never danced before. What… a feeling.






Christie Portera

Portera, a.k.a. Christie Bean, lives her entire life like it’s Prom night. This feisty young-in has an eye for a crazy, fabulous outfit and an even more crazy, fabulous photoshoot. She promises to be one of the MVPs of The 11th Annual Broadway Prom.







"QUEENS"






Nick Cearley

Cearley competes for the crown every week in PAGEANT, so he’s got a leg up on the competition. If he comes to Prom in his black tie skivvies, he’s sure to gain extra votes.






Jarvis Derrell

Wheeeewwwww Keisha gurrrrrrrl, Derrell has HAD IT with attending Broadway Prom year after year with no recognition of his fabulousness. Vote for him, and make his shondaladreams come true!








Alexis Michelle

Michelle is one fishy Prom queen. She’s serving tuna on a platter with a side of Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve and Talent. She promises a sickening gown & is willing to lipsync for her life… and your votes.






Paul Staroba

Staroba accepted this nomination out of sheer fear of 10-time Prom Queen Dani Spieler. Nevertheless, this gentleman knows a thing or two about love and murder, so it may be in your best interest to vote for him. 







Dizzy Feet Founation
Dizzy Feet Foundation was founded in 2009 by producer Nigel Lythgoe and director Adam Shankman, among others, to support, improve and increase access to dance education in the United States.

The most underrated musical of the season! Bandstand seamlessly blends honest, humorous, and heartfelt performances with an incredible swing inspired score and charismatic Tony-winning choreography. The actors playing their instruments live on stage is mesmerizing and the showstoppers at the ends of both acts will leave you cheering for more!

Come From Away will renew your faith in mankind. It manages to be tuneful, heartfelt and hysterically funny (sometimes, all at the same time) and it is possibly the most delightfully entertaining affirmation of humanity you will see for a long, long time.

Successful screen-to-stage adaptations are rare enough, but when one comes along that is as clever, funny, and moving as Groundhog Day, attention must be paid.  It features some of the smartest staging on Broadway, a beautiful score and a stellar lead performance from Andy Karl.  What more could you ask for?

Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 is a lush and rich explosion of high energy, jaw-dropping beauty and pure splendor. The entire show is an immersive theatrical experience that is unlike anything that has ever played Broadway before and it should not be missed!

A Doll's House, Part 2 is my favorite new play of the season. You don't have to know the original A Doll's House to appreciate this show. The writing is incredibly modern and each character of the tight cast gets his or her moment to shine.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
