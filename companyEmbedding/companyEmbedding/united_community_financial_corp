Interview 
	conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published  August 
	12, 2013

CEOCFO: 
	Mr. Bevack, every bank has its own personality and story. Would you give us 
	some basics about Home Savings?


Mr. Bevack: 
	Home Savings has a great story and history to share. The Bank was founded in 
	1889 and was a family owned thrift until 1998, when it underwent a 
	mutual-to-stock conversion to form the holding company, United Community 
	Financial Corp., which enabled us to take advantage of opportunities for 
	corporate growth and product diversity. After the IPO, we acquired a 
	Youngstown broker dealer, Butler Wick Company and its trust company Butler 
	Wick Trust.  In addition, we acquired some healthy thrifts which included 
	Industrial Bank ($450 mil in assets) and Potters Financial Corporation ($150 
	mil in assets). We were heavily involved in the commercial A&D builder 
	business until the economy took a turn for the worst in 2007-2009. In 2008, 
	we were placed under a Cease and Desist Order which was agreed to by the 
	Bank. At that point, many things changed and 
	we had to shift gears from growth mode to survival mode. We knew we had to 
	create a strong management team to navigate through what would be very tough 
	times ahead. In 2009, I was appointed CEO and President of Home Savings and 
	in 2011 I was appointed CEO of the Holding Company as well. Over the course 
	of those few years we made many management changes which included the 
	addition of a chief credit officer and chief lending officer. Our chief 
	credit officer established a stronger credit culture which was and still is 
	vital to the Banks future. Times were challenging from 2009 to 2012 but we 
	implemented a solid strategic plan which has now proven to be successful. In 
	2012, we did a bulk asset sale and sold approximately $115 million of 
	troubled loans. In 2013, we held a private stock offering for $40 million. 
	Additionally, the board invested $2 million and we did a rights offering of 
	$5 million. Altogether, we raised $47 million in 2013. All of our Orders 
	have been lifted and we are now considered well capitalized. I believe we 
	have a great story to tell and our comeback says a lot about the Bank and 
	our great employees.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What gave you the confidence to take on the challenge?


Mr. Bevack: 
	Prior to taking over as CEO and president I worked at Home Savings for 8 
	years as the executive vice president/chief financial officer. Therefore, I 
	knew the Bank had a great reputation and I had already had the opportunity 
	to work with many of the talented employees. I knew we had a great 
	foundation and I understood what needed to be done to restore profitability 
	back to the Company. I was confident I could assemble a strong leadership 
	team to take on the many challenges. I also believed in Youngstown (also 
	referred to as the Mahoning Valley). The Valley is an area that has been 
	under great pressure for many decades due to decline in manufacturing and 
	the steel industry. However, with shale development on the rise, I knew the 
	Mahoning Valley would be presented with significant opportunities. So far, 
	this has been real positive for the area. Many of the properties in our area 
	are under lease for the gas and oil drilling. In fact many landowners have 
	turned to our Home Investment Services as a trusted place to seek investment 
	advice for their shale wealth. I am a board member of the Youngstown-Warren 
	Regional Chamber and we have been attracting many new companies to the area 
	too. The economy is more robust and it is going to get even better. I am 
	glad I accepted the challenge and I look forward to the future for both the 
	Bank and Youngstown.  

 


CEOCFO: 
	How does the bank breakdown today between consumer and business and would 
	you like to see the mix change?


Mr. Bevack: 
	Very good question. We are a community bank very strong in residential 
	mortgage lending. We do residential mortgage lending throughout Ohio as well 
	as northwestern Pennsylvania but primarily in Youngstown, Cleveland, and 
	Akron. We have been fairly active in the consumer market as well. Another 
	area we believe we can excel is C&I (commercial and industrial) type 
	business; that is a focus for us now. We now have a strong team in place 
	prepared for this type of lending due to the growth in our market. In terms 
	of the future, we will seek out more commercial business than we have in the 
	past. And we are in a great position being a community bank. While the 
	bigger banks are not looking for the $3 to $5 million loan deals, we welcome 
	them. We also have investment services for individuals through a third party 
	brokerage and we would like to focus more on wealth management. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	When someone comes into a Home Savings branch what is different?


Mr. Bevack: 
	We are a community bank that has been serving the Youngstown area for nearly 
	125 years. Home Savings is a household name in the Mahoning Valley. 
	Youngstown is somewhat of a small town and everyone knows one another. 
	Because of this, we have very loyal customers. We also have retail branches 
	in Northwest Ohio and in Cleveland. We are still considered a community bank 
	in those markets and although some of the branches are in bigger communities 
	we still know our customers and we have the luxury of offering a hometown 
	feel while still offering a vast array of products and services. The mega 
	and regional banks do not have that same kind of following. Our branch 
	employees are friendly, knowledgeable and they genuinely care about our 
	customers. Home Savings is a bank with a lot of tradition and I think that 
	makes us different. Not too many banks can say they have operated and 
	remained the same bank for 125 years.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Do you feel that the size and the number of branches enable you to provide 
	more for the customers along with the hometown feel?


Mr. Bevack: 
	Absolutely. Because we are not a megabank, we can take a more personalized 
	approach to helping customers. Our customers know us and they continue to 
	count on us to meet their financial needs. We also offer the same great 
	products and services as a large bank but we have the luxury of maintaining 
	a hometown feel; it is the best of both worlds. Our geography lends itself 
	to great opportunities as well. If you are familiar with the area at all it 
	consists of Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and Cleveland, which is sort of the 
	corridor. In terms of future growth opportunities, we could not be in a 
	better location.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you reach potential new customers?


Mr. Bevack: 
	There are several ways depending on the product. For example, if you are 
	talking about residential mortgage loans one of the most important things we 
	do is recruit qualified, experienced loan originators (LOs). These are 
	experienced employees that have been in the business for many years and have 
	done a tremendous number of loans. In fact, one of our loan originators has 
	had over $60 million in loans closed this year alone. These employees are 
	almost like independent business men/women whose businesses join ours. Our 
	branches also refer business to our LOs on an ongoing basis. Other ways we 
	attract new customers is through the branches, advertising, and word of 
	mouth. Home Savings is a household name especially in Youngstown and so we 
	do get a lot of customers referring business to us. Commercial lending is an 
	area of the bank that is making a comeback and we are using our same model 
	and philosophy for recruitment of mortgage LOs to recruit commercial LOs. 
	Commercial lending is primarily about relationship building. It consists of 
	prospecting and successfully identifying your centers of influence. Lastly, 
	we are a very community oriented bank and our employees are involved in many 
	non-profits and organizations, which allows them to network and in turn 
	bring in new business to the Bank.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Your site shows that giving back is important. Is there a particular focus 
	or does each community or does the branch decide?

Mr. Bevack: 
	It is a combination of both. Home Savings is committed to reinvesting in the 
	local communities we serve by providing leadership, employee involvement and 
	financial support. Our biggest source of funds to non-profits is through our 
	charitable foundation, which is independent from the bank. Since its 
	inception in1998, the Home Savings Charitable Foundation has provided over 
	$11 million of support to worthy non-profit organizations, with our focus 
	being primarily directed toward those that serve the needs of disadvantaged 
	children or provide educational programs. We have a committee of local 
	people that helps decide what kinds of initiatives we are going to 
	contribute towards. Beyond that, each individual branch works on specific 
	efforts in their communities as well. The branches know the community they 
	serve better than anyone so on a smaller level we allow branches to request 
	funds for initiatives they feel are beneficial. As a Bank we also support 
	our own initiatives. In November 2012, we launched a hunger campaign called 
	Home-Aide Meals. People could like us on Facebook and for every like we 
	contributed $1.00, which provided four meals to those in need. The branches 
	participated by collecting food and money. In total we raised fifty-thousand 
	meals for children, adults and families. As you can see we are charitable 
	through all networks  branches, Bank and foundation. And together we all 
	make a difference.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why should the business and investment community pay attention to United 
	Community Financial and Home Savings?
Mr. Bevack: I think if you understand 
	our story of where we have been and the challenging times we have overcome, 
	you will pay attention and take note. History is so important; the past does 
	not project the future but the past gives you some indication of where you 
	are going and our Bank is on the rise. When I took over, UCFC stock was 
	selling for roughly $1.35 a share and currently it is selling at $4.80. 
	Cleveland Crains just did an article on the top two-year returns as of 
	April 30th 2013 and United Community Financial led the list at 
	197%. From an investor standpoint, it has been good in terms of stock price. 
	However, but not we have not been able to 
	pay dividends for a few years due to the Orders we were under. Our Company 
	has had significant issues and we have made it through them. Many banks in 
	the country were faced with the same issues and they did not make it. It was 
	not easy but we followed our plan and accomplished all of the goals and it 
	has paid off. We have had our Orders lifted, sold troubled assets through a 
	bulk loan sale and we successfully raised $47 million worth of capital. 
	These private equity investors who purchased stock are individuals who study 
	the numbers and the future and they had the confidence to invest in us. To 
	be honest we could have raised much more than the $47 million but it was not 
	warranted. If you look at the numbers, our prospects in the future as well 
	as the markets we serve, you can see a Company that is in a great position 
	to leverage growth opportunities. Our story is a good one for any investor; 
	look at where we were and compare it to now. It is quite impressive.

About Us
Home Savings, a subsidiary of United Community Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: UCFC), is a full-service community bank headquartered in Youngstown, Ohio.
Founded in 1889, Home Savings has always maintained a commitment to developing long-standing relationships with local residents and businesses by providing its customers a full range of retail and commercial banking products and service that exceed expectations.
One of Home Savings' greatest strengths continues to be its level of community involvement, evidenced by its strong presence in a variety of service organizations, charitable causes and public efforts. Home Savings employees are encouraged to become active members of civic groups, economic development programs, educational projects and urban revitalization efforts.
In 1998, Home Savings underwent a mutual-to-stock conversion to form its holding company, United Community Financial Corp., enabling opportunities for further corporate growth and product diversity. At the same time, the Home Savings Charitable Foundation was formed to further strengthen its positive impact within the community. The Foundation focuses contributions in the areas of education, health care and disadvantaged children and adults, and since its inception, has contributed over $15 million dollars to non-profit organizations throughout Home Savings' market areas.
In February of 2016, Home Savings formed the Home Savings Insurance Group with the acquisition of James & Sons, a well-respected local insurance agency that has been serving the Mahoning Valley since 1921. In January 2017, Premier Bank & Trust joined Home Savings and in March, 2017, Eich Bros Insurance joined the Home Savings Insurance Group.
With assets of approximately $2.5 billion, Home Savings currently operates 35 retail banking offices and 12 loan production centers throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia with approximately 500 employees.
