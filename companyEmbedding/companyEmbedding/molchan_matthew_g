22 Stocks Moving In Monday's Pre-Market Session 

7 Stocks Under $7 Paying Dividends 

Digirad Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAD) announced today that as part of a planned transition from its previously announced restructuring plan, President Matthew G. Molchan will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer, effective July 1. Molchan has also been named a Director of the Company. 
Molchan, 46, was formerly the President of the DIS division. He first came to Digirad when it acquired Ultrascan, Inc., the Southeast's largest mobile imaging service company in May 2007, where Molchan was CFO and ran daily operations. Prior to that, Molchan held various executive positions at Somera, Inc. and Equifax. Molchan holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Air Force Academy and a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Southern California. 
"Given the Board's decision to focus on the DIS division and grow our services business going forward, Matt was the natural choice to become CEO of Digirad," said Jeff Eberwein, Chairman of the Digirad Board of Directors. "Matt has a detailed understanding of the Company and he shares our goals of maximizing shareholder value by increasing cash flow and repurchasing shares. We are very excited about having him assume the CEO role in addition to his position as President and look forward to his active participation and contributions at the board level." 
"Our entire Board would like to thank Todd Clyde for his contributions to Digirad over the past decade," Eberwein added. "Todd has worked very hard and has been a selfless leader. We wish him well in his future endeavors."
