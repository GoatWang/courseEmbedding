History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

Awards and recognition[edit]
Angelo, Gordon’s portfolio managers have in recent years been noted for top performance in their investment strategies. Angelo, Gordon’s CMBS fund and the non-investment grade corporate credit fund were recognized by Bloomberg for Best Performance for Directional Fixed Income (2011-2014.) [26] The RMBS/ABS fund appeared in Barron’s Top 100 Hedge Funds in 2013[27] and in 2014.[28] Angelo, Gordon’s flagship multistrategy fund appeared in Business Insider’s 100 Most Successful Hedge Funds in 2012,[29] Bloomberg ‘s 100 Top Performing Large Hedge Funds in 2013[30] and won the award for CreditFlux Best Credit Multistrategy in 2014.[31][32]

Liquid strategies — credit opportunities, convertible arbitrage and risk arbitrage.

History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

Awards and recognition[edit]
Angelo, Gordon’s portfolio managers have in recent years been noted for top performance in their investment strategies. Angelo, Gordon’s CMBS fund and the non-investment grade corporate credit fund were recognized by Bloomberg for Best Performance for Directional Fixed Income (2011-2014.) [26] The RMBS/ABS fund appeared in Barron’s Top 100 Hedge Funds in 2013[27] and in 2014.[28] Angelo, Gordon’s flagship multistrategy fund appeared in Business Insider’s 100 Most Successful Hedge Funds in 2012,[29] Bloomberg ‘s 100 Top Performing Large Hedge Funds in 2013[30] and won the award for CreditFlux Best Credit Multistrategy in 2014.[31][32]

History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

Awards and recognition[edit]
Angelo, Gordon’s portfolio managers have in recent years been noted for top performance in their investment strategies. Angelo, Gordon’s CMBS fund and the non-investment grade corporate credit fund were recognized by Bloomberg for Best Performance for Directional Fixed Income (2011-2014.) [26] The RMBS/ABS fund appeared in Barron’s Top 100 Hedge Funds in 2013[27] and in 2014.[28] Angelo, Gordon’s flagship multistrategy fund appeared in Business Insider’s 100 Most Successful Hedge Funds in 2012,[29] Bloomberg ‘s 100 Top Performing Large Hedge Funds in 2013[30] and won the award for CreditFlux Best Credit Multistrategy in 2014.[31][32]

Miami target of a racist and ignorant taunt from Utah, Boston journalists

Tom D'Angelo 


July 3, 2017  2017 offseason, Free agency, Tom D'Angelo.

Gordon Hayward
Gordon Hayward will be making a decision about his future in the next few days. But it will have nothing to do with the racist, ignorant views of some who are lining up in Utah’s or Boston’s corner.
Two takes, one from each city, hinted Hayward should prefer playing in Utah or Boston because Miami is a) too culturally diverse and b) too much of a party town.
Hayward, who visited the Heat and Celtics over the weekend and is meeting with his old team, Utah, today, is expected to announce his decision Tuesday or Wednesday.
Adam Kaufman, a morning-drive talking-head for a Boston radio station, last week reported he continues to “hear” that Hayward would not be a fit in Miami because he is “not a going out, partying type.”


I continue to hear Miami is not good fit for Gordon Hayward personality-wise. Not a going out, partying type. #Heat https://t.co/bR2IsJde8K
— Adam Kaufman (@AdamMKaufman) June 28, 2017

First, Kaufman must have taken LeBron James’ “I’m taking my talents to South Beach” speech literally and believes the Heat and every other team plays on the tip of Miami Beach and that every athlete is forced to live on Collins Ave.
And unless Kaufman just finished watching Scarface or a Miami Vice marathon, there is no plausible explanation as to why an adult believes that Miami offers nothing but out-of-control parties and everybody who lives there stays out to 5 a.m.
Now, if Kaufman said Hayward and his wife, Robyn, are not good fits because they are not the types who want to live in a tropical climate where they can visit the beach and wear flip-flops year round without the danger frost bite, then he might have been on to something.
The attack on South Florida got worst when Ben Dowsett, whose Twitter account lists him as the Deputy Editor of Basketball Insiders and is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, sent out a tweet that he later deleted. It read:
  Heat fans seriously have trouble figuring out why UTAH is a more family-friendly place than Miami.
 

Dowsett then confirmed the tone behind the tweet when his apology read he “didn’t consider the implications of the wording.”
According to the Miami New Times, Dowsett’s mentions blew up asking for an explanation and he continued to hint Utah’s makeup of 81.6 percent non-Hispanic whites translates to more “family-friendly” than an area as culturally and racially diverse at Miami and South Florida.
And if Dowsett believes the Haywards would be turned off to an area because of its diversity, he has not seen Robyn Hayward’s Instagram that links to loveguatemala.org, an organization that “exists to give hope to Guatemalans through the gospel of Jesus Christ and vocational training.”
