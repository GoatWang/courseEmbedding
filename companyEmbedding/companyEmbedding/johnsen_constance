JOHNSON’S®: Here For You
At JOHNSON’S® Baby, we care about your baby, and we care what we put in your favorite products. Each ingredient is carefully tested to make sure we’re giving you what you need, and nothing else.









 



Ingredients
We know long lists of scientific names can be confusing and overwhelming. We’re here to make it make sense.











EXPLORE INGREDIENTS







 






 



Safety Standards
We don’t let any product go to stores without ensuring that it’s safe and effective for your baby. Promise.











READ SAFETY STANDARDS







 





What’s the Latest in Ingredients and Products:
We will never stop innovating to maintain the highest standards in our ingredients and products. Here’s the latest regarding ingredients and industry safety standards:

Morning Routine | JOHNSON’S®
Babyproofing your house doesn’t make life easier. But it does make it safer. At Johnson’s, we care about safety as much as you do.











Sitters Interview | JOHNSON’S®


Video of Sitters Interview | JOHNSON’S®



 


Sitters Interview | JOHNSON’S®
Picking the right person to care for your child is tough. So is picking the ingredients that go into baby products.










 



Safety in our Products
To ensure you have peace of mind when using JOHNSON’S® products, we have spent the last two years reformulating our products. We’re proud to release improved formulas, which are phthalate and paraben free. We’ve excluded thousands of ingredients over the years based on new science and based on what you’ve told us is important to you. 










SEARCH PRODUCTS







 






 



Safety in our ingredients
There is a lot of information out there about talc, not all of it true, so we wanted to share some basic facts to keep you well informed.


Talc comes from rock deposits found all over the planet and is mined like many other valuable minerals, but only the highest-grade talc, meeting our purity specifications, is used for talcum powder


It is hypoallergenic, helps eliminate friction and is clinically proven to be gentle and mild for your baby’s skin.


Study data showed no increased risk of ovarian cancer in women who used talcum powder, regardless of the type of use. There was also no increase in risk among women who used powder for longer periods of time.













Click here to see more information from the US Food and Drug Administration, and here for more information from the American Cancer Society.

Testimonials





I know what goes into the development of our products, the time, the giant team of experts, the care. Not just in selecting the best ingredients for babies, but the effort that goes into the whole process to meet the high standards we follow. That’s why I’ve always had JOHNSON’S® products in our home, both for myself and for my kids.
Janet Nikolovski, Ph.D. Associate Director and Fellow JOHNSON’S® Baby Research & Development. Mother to twins.
