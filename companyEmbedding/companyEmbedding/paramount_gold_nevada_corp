(“Amax”) from 1986 until 1996, producing 1.66 million ounces of gold and  2.3 million ounces of silver.  Paramount  has assembled a district-scale project with significant unexplored gold  potential. The project land position includes staked and purchased lands which  brings the total holdings to approximately 60 square miles or 15,500 hectares  stretching south on trend to Newmont’s Sandman Project.

  Amax’s mining operation left a  legacy of superb infrastructure in place including excellent accessibility by all-weather  roads to and within the property; electrical power (from the Nevada State grid);  and water (two operating, deep water wells are located on the property).
Paramount’s recent exploration  and engineering programs at the Sleeper Gold Project confirm a very large,  relatively low grade, surface resource of gold and silver which is bulk  mineable at a low cost. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) conducted to  examine the potential of operating Sleeper in a lower gold price environment  with low capital and operational costs. The new study proposed a 30,000 tonne  per day heap leach only operation with a low strip ratio and quick payback  period of 3.5 years. In the current economic environment, the smaller footprint  of the project significantly impacted the project economics, highlighted below,  The PEA found significant reductions in both capital operating costs along with  improved project grade and excellent recoveries which together produced an  attractive bottom line (for PEA details click here).  
The  PEA also considered an expanded operation in which the large inventory of  non-leachable sulphide ore would be processed through a mill. This is an  attractive option in a better metal price environment.
  The project’s extensive land  holdings contain significant potential for discovery of new high grade deposits,  similar to the one mined by Amax, on lands that have seen little modern exploration.  These unexplored opportunities prompted Paramount to complete a helicopter magnetometry  to assist in identifying new discoveries. A number of attractive targets  emerged in this work.
Current  Program
The PEA was completed by Metal  Mining Consultants (“MMC”) who recommended that a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) should be undertaken  at an estimated cost of $1.45 million. Components of the PFS are as follows: 

An  expanded metallurgical testing program to verify and optimize metallurgical  recovery for the various zones. This process would require a drill program to  develop sample materials which would also convert additional Inferred  mineralized material to Measured & Indicated.


Ongoing  environmental monitoring with the goal of starting the permitting processes  related to re-opening the former operation.


Converting  inferred mineralized material within the mine plan to measured & indicated 

With the recent addition of the Grassy  Mountain Gold project to Paramount’s asset portfolio, Paramount is focusing first  on advancing the more economically robust Grassy Mountain Project with the  commencement of a PFS.
With its large resource base  totalling over five million gold equivalent ounces, Sleeper provides Paramount  with excellent leverage to the price of gold and represents an excellent  opportunity in a rising gold price environment. The Paramount Nevada team is evaluating  the advancement of Sleeper through to the completion of a PFS and assessing the  potential of new geophysics programs, including helicopter magnetometry, to  help identify high priority drill targets outside the main resource area.  
Exploration  History at Sleeper Gold Project
Paramount conducted its first  exploration program at the Sleeper Gold mine in October 2010 consisting of 19  drill holes totalling 18,065 feet to verify data in existing models and confirm  continuity and strike extensions of known mineralized zones. From July 1, 2011  through June 30, 2012, Paramount completed another 79 drill holes totalling  21,013 feet and followed that up in the period from July 1, 2012, through June  30, 2013 with a further 38 drill holes totalling 55,104 feet.
In August 2011, Paramount  announced the acquisition of 606 unpatented lode mining claims (the “Dunes  Project”) located 11 miles south of the Sleeper Gold mine from ICN Resources  Ltd. (“ICN”)
In September 2011, Paramount  announced the results of a new material estimate on the Sleeper Gold mine  prepared by SRK Consulting (“SRK”). This estimate was conducted in accordance  with the Canadian standards set forth in National Instrument 43-101. Based on  the results of the report, the Company commissioned Scott E. Wilson Consulting  Inc. (“SEWC”) to prepare a PEA for the project. The PEA was designed to  evaluate both the technical and financial aspects of various production  scenarios using the material estimate developed by SRK.
In July 2012, Paramount announced  the results of the PEA completed by SEWC on the Sleeper Gold mine property. 
  SEWC concluded that the most  attractive development scenario consists of a large-scale open pit mining  operation with a heap leach processing plant handling both oxide and sulfide  material, producing a gold-silver ore. The PEA assumed an 81,000 ton per day  operation resulting in a projected 17-year operation with an average annual  production of 172,000 ounces of gold and 263,000 ounces of silver. Paramount  received the completed PEA report in September 2012. There can be no certainty  that the scenarios or estimated economics in the PEA will be realized.
In July 2012, Paramount announced  the staking of 920 new lode mining claims (the “Mimi Project”) adjacent to the  west and immediately south, of the Sleeper Gold mine. The Mimi Project totals 18,400  acres.
In 2013, Paramount announced results  of a drilling campaign which was focused in and around the existing resource  and pit areas. Assay results extended the mineralization east and south of the  existing resource, opened up new depth potential below the existing sleeper pit  and intercepted exceptional results in several zones. Additionally, Paramount  undertook an extensive database review and as a result, a total of 473 core and  RC holes have been re-logged and new cross-sections were generated. Paramount  completed a re-interpreted lithological and structural model to enable the  Company to plan a new drill program and to update its mineralized material  estimate model.
In August 2014, Paramount dropped  a total of 248 mining claims from its Sleeper Gold Project. These claims were  determined to have no geological value to the Company.
In December  2015, Paramount Nevada filed a National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report  related to the Preliminary Economic Assessment on www.sedar.com.  The report was completed by Metal Mining  Consultants (www.metalminingconsultants.com)(“MMC”) of Denver, Colorado with the objective of the PEA to:

Build a new mineralized material estimate from the reinterpreted  historical drilling and recently completed drill testing. 
Incorporate newly completed metallurgical  testing which demonstrated excellent recovery for oxide and mixed  ores and identified process options to enhance recovery for extensive sulfide  ores left behind by previous operators.
Re-assess the economic opportunity offered by the existing  resources within the historical Sleeper Mine area.

Highlights of the PEA  include:

Low  Initial Capital of $175 Million for a 30,000 tonnes per day operation
Estimated  annual production of 102,000 ounces of Gold and 105,000 ounces of Silver
Low  cash operating cost of $529 per ounce of Gold Equivalent produced
Base  Case has a $244 million pre-tax net cash flow, a $167 million net present value  at a 5% discount rate and an internal rate of return of 25%
Quick  capital payback period of 3.5 years based on after tax cash flows
Confirms  the potential to add mineralized material

Geology and  Mineralization 
The Sleeper Gold Project is  situated within the western part of the Northern Nevada Rift a geologic  province of Miocene age that hosts several productive gold mining camps (GLEN—NAMES  INSERTED HERE). The project is located along the western flank of the  Slumbering Hills–a north trending mountain range bounded by faults.  Faults on the flank of the range are  north-northeast trending and drop the Paleozoic stratigraphy exposed in the  range and the Miocene volcanic rocks down into the Desert Valley.  These faults have accumulated down-throw of  more than 1,000 meters and have focused hydrothermal gold-bearing fluids toward  the surface.  One of these favourable north-northeast  trending faults controls the location of the Sleeper Gold deposit.
Gold concentrations in the  Sleeper Gold Project have been recognized in four distinct settings:

Early  – quartz-pyrite-marcasite stockwork propagating into the wall-rock around  structures.
Intermediate  – medium-grade, silica-pyrite-marcasite cemented breccia in pipe-like or  irregular bodies.
Late  – high-grade, banded, quartz-adularia-electrum (sericite) in narrow to very  wide discrete veins.
Post  – alluvial gold-silver deposits in Pliocene gravels, localized in paleo-channels in  dominantly unconsolidated  material. 

Within the Sleeper Gold Project  all of these gold occurrences have been identified, but the intermediate and  late stage mineralization are the styles that were exploited historically and  brought notoriety to this Northern Nevada Gold Camp. These main stage  mineralizing events are interpreted as a high sulfidation system, intimately  associated with Miocene intrusive rocks and generated from magmatic fluids  emanating from that source.
In  the extensive land package associated with the Sleeper Gold Project, two of the  key components for the discovery of additional high-grade vein systems have  therefore been established.  These lands  contain north-northeast trending faults to provide a trap for gold  mineralization and Miocene igneous rocks, a source for gold-bearing  fluids.  The mining district that  contains the Sleeper Gold Project is constrained on the north end by the  historical Sleeper mine and the extensive known resource and on the south end  by Newmont’s Sandman deposit.  Between  these deposits, the north-northeast trending faults and Miocene igneous rocks  are our focus with systematic direct and indirect exploration to find  concentrations of high-grade gold.

Governance




Code Of Business Conduct And Ethics For Paramount Gold Nevada Corp.
The Board of Directors (“BOD”) of Paramount Gold is comprised of 5 directors, of which 4 are independent of management. The BOD has three Committees composed entirely of independent directors which meet regularly in fulfillment of their BOD-approved mandates as set out in the Charters below. The BOD is responsible for approving and overseeing corporate governance policies and procedures and for the implementation and monitoring of the Company`s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as follows.
Code Of Conduct
Introduction
Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. (the “COMPANY”) is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “CODE”) sets forth the Company’s policies with respect to the way individuals conduct themselves and how the company operates. The provisions of this Code are designed to promote honest and ethical conduct among employees, officers and directors and to deter wrongdoing.
In the course of performing their various roles in the Company, individuals will encounter ethical questions in different forms and under a variety of circumstances. Moments of ethical uncertainty may arise in dealings with fellow employees of the Company, with customers, or with other parties such as government entities or community members. In achieving the high ground of ethical behavior, compliance with governmental laws is not enough. Employees should never be content with simply obeying the letter of the law. They must also strive to comport themselves in an honest and ethical manner. The Company’s Code provides clear rules to assist employees, directors and officers to take appropriate action when faced with an ethical dilemma.
The greatest asset of our Company is its reputation, and its value relies on the character of its employees. To protect this asset, the Company will not tolerate unethical behavior by employees, officers or directors. Those who violate the standards in this Code will be subject to disciplinary action. If you are concerned about taking an action that may violate the Code or are aware of a violation by another employee, officer or director, follow the guidelines set forth in Sections 10 and 11 of this Code.
This Code applies equally to all employees, officers and directors of the Company. All references to employees contained in this Code should be understood as referring to officers and directors as well.

 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

Company policy requires that the Company, as well as all employees, officers and directors of the Company, comply fully with both the spirit and the letter of all laws, rules and regulations. Whenever an applicable law, rule or regulation is unclear or seems to conflict with either another law or any provision of this Code, all employees, officers and directors are urged to seek clarification from their supervisor, the appropriate compliance official or the Company’s President. See Section 11 for contact information. Beyond mere compliance with the law, we should always conduct our business with the highest standards of honesty and integrity – wherever we operate.

 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Every employee has a primary business responsibility to the Company and must avoid conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest arises when an employee takes actions or enters into relationships that oppose the interests of the Company, harm the Company’s reputation or interfere with the employee’s performance or independent judgment when carrying out any actions on behalf of the Company. The Company strictly prohibits its employees from taking any action or entering into any relationship, personal or professional that creates, or even appears to create, a conflict of interest.
A conflict situation can arise when a director, officer or employee takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interests may also arise when a director, officer or employee, or a member of his or her family, receives an improper personal benefit as a result of his or her position with the Company. It may be a conflict of interest for a director, officer or employee to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with our customers, suppliers or competitors, except on our behalf. Employees must be sensitive to potential conflicts of interest that may arise and use their best efforts to avoid the conflict.
Directors, officers and employees must notify the Chief Executive Officer of the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest. With respect to officers or directors, the Board may make a determination that a particular transaction or relationship will not result in a conflict of interest covered by this policy. With respect to all other employees or agents, either the Chief Executive Officer acting alone or the Board may make such a determination. Any waivers of this policy for an officer or director may only be approved by the Board of Directors.
Any employee, officer or director who is aware of a transaction or relationship that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest in violation of this section must inform the appropriate personnel in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12 of this Code. If an employee has any questions regarding the Company’s policy on conflicts of interest or needs assistance in avoiding a potential conflict of interest, he or she is urged to seek the advice of a supervisor or the Chief Executive Officer.

 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

Employees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company property, Company information or their position in the Company. Furthermore, employees may not use Company property, information or influence or their position in the Company for improper personal gain. Finally, employees have a duty to advance the Company’s legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees are not permitted to compete with the Company.

 CONFIDENTIALITY

Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by the Company or its customers or suppliers, except when disclosure is authorized by the Company or required by applicable laws or regulations. Confidential information includes proprietary information of the Company, as well as all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers, if disclosed. This confidentiality is in addition to any other obligations imposed by the Company to keep information confidential.

 INSIDER TRADING

Employees, officers and directors will frequently become aware of confidential non-public information concerning the Company and the parties with which the Company does business. As set forth in more detail in the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, the Company prohibits employees from using such confidential information for personal financial gain, such as for purposes of stock trading, or for any other purpose other than the conduct of our business. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of such information and may not make disclosures to third parties, including members of the employee’s family. All non-public information about the Company should be treated as confidential information. To use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who may make stock trades on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. This policy also applies to trading in the securities of any other company, including our customers or suppliers, if employees have material, non-public information about that company which the employee obtained in the course of their employment by the Company. In addition to possible legal sanctions, any employee, officer or director found to be in violation of the Company’s insider trading policy will face decisive disciplinary action. Employees are encouraged to contact the Company’s Chief Executive Officer with any questions concerning this policy.

 PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS

All Company assets should be used for legitimate business purposes and all employees, officers and directors must make all reasonable efforts to protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability and must therefore be avoided. The suspected occurrence of fraud or theft should be immediately reported to the appropriate person in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11 of this Code.
An employee’s obligation to protect the Company’s assets extends to the Company’s proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. An employee who uses or distributes such proprietary information without the Company’s authorization will be subject to disciplinary measures as well as potential legal sanctions.

 FAIR DEALING

Although the success of our Company depends on our ability to outperform our competitors, the Company is committed to achieving success by fair and ethical means. We seek to maintain a reputation for fair dealing among our competitors and the public alike. In light of this aim, the Company prohibits employees from engaging in any unethical or illegal business practices. An exhaustive list of unethical practices cannot be provided. Instead, the Company relies on the judgment of each individual employee to avoid such practices. Furthermore, each employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair business practice.

 DISCLOSURES

It is Company policy to make full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in all other public communications made by the Company. Employees shall endeavor in good faith to assist the Company in such efforts.

 WAIVERS

The Company expects all employees, officers and directors to comply with the provisions of this Code. Any waiver of this Code for executive officers, directors or employees may be made only by the Board of Directors or a Board committee and will be promptly disclosed to the public as required by law and stock exchange regulations.

 COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES AND RESOURCES

In some situations, our employees may not be certain how to proceed in compliance with this Code. This uncertainty may concern the ethical nature of the employee’s own acts or the employee’s duty to report the unethical acts of another. When faced with this uncertainty, the employee should carefully analyze the situation and make use of Company resources when determining the proper course of action. The Company also encourages employees to talk to their supervisors, or other personnel identified below, when in doubt about the best course of action.

Gather all the facts. Do not take any action that may violate the Code until you have gathered all the facts that are required to make a well-informed decision and, if necessary, you have consulted with your supervisor, or the Chief Executive Officer.
Is the action illegal or contrary to policy? If the action is illegal or contrary to the provision of this Code, you should not carry out the act. If you believe that the Code has been violated by an employee, an officer or a director, you must promptly report the violation in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.
Discuss the problem with your supervisor. It is your supervisor’s duty to assist employees in complying with this Code. Feel free to discuss a situation that raises ethical issues with your supervisor if you have any questions. You will suffer no retaliation for seeking such guidance.
Additional resources. The Chief Executive Officer is available to speak with you about problematic situations if you do not feel comfortable approaching your direct supervisor. If you prefer, you may request assistance in writing by sending a request to the Chief Executive Officer.
 REPORTING PROCEDURES

All employees have a duty to report any violations of this Code, as well as violations of any laws, rules, or regulations. The Company does not permit retaliation of any kind against employees for good faith reports of ethical violations.
If you believe that the Code has been violated by an employee you must promptly report the violation to your direct supervisor or the Chief Executive Officer. If a report is made to a supervisor, the supervisor must in turn report the violation to the Chief Executive Officer. All violations by an officer or director of the Company must be reported directly to the entire Board of Directors.

 CONTACT INFORMATION

Reports may be made in person, by telephone or in writing by sending a description of the violation and the names of the parties involved to the appropriate personnel mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The contact information is as follows:

Winnemucca, NV 89445
Telephone: (775) 625-3600
 

 DISCIPLINARY ACTION

Employees, officers and directors of the Company will be held accountable for adherence to this Code. The penalty for a particular violation of this Code will be decided on a case-by-case basis and will depend on the nature and severity of the violation as well as the employee’s history of non-compliance and cooperation in the disciplinary process. Significant penalties will be imposed for violations resulting from intentional or reckless behavior. Penalties may also be imposed when an employee fails to report a violation due to the employee’s indifference, deliberate ignorance or reckless conduct. All violations of this Code will be treated seriously and will result in the prompt imposition of penalties which may include (1) an oral or written warning, (2) a reprimand, (3) suspension, (4) termination and/or (5) restitution.

 NO RIGHTS CREATED

This Code is a statement of certain fundamental principles, policies and procedures that govern the Company’s officers, directors and employees in the conduct of the Company’s business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in any employee, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or entity.

Consensus Ratings for Paramount Gold Nevada Corp (ARCA:PZG) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $2.30

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							Find Your Paramount Model Number						



							When you need replacement parts for your Paramount hedge trimmer, edger, or blower, the best place to start is with the model number. That way you won’t have to guess at what might or might not work with your tool when you’re browsing our parts. If you still have the owner’s manual that came with your lawn equipment, you can find the model number in the first few pages there. Otherwise, you will need to search a bit on your tool to find the information you need. 

First, check around the engine housing. Look for a metal tag that’s hidden from view to help prevent the wear and tear that lawn equipment sees on a regular basis. If you don’t see it there, check on the nameplate, the shaft, and on the back side of the tool. Depending on the model, Paramount may place the model number in any of these locations. 

Once you find the model number, just enter it above to bring up a parts diagram specific to your tool. If you’re still having trouble, don’t fret it. Just give us a call and we’ll happily help you find the model number and parts you need for your repair. 						






							Help with Your Paramount Repair						

							So you received a new carburetor for your hedge trimmers, or perhaps a new gas tank for your leaf blower. And you just can’t wait to get your equipment up and running again. But there’s one problem: you aren’t really sure where to begin. But you don’t have to worry. That’s because we do more than just help you find the parts you need for your repairs, we can help you get through your repairs too. 

First, you should check out our Repair Center. Here we post hundreds of articles on a variety of repair topics, including replacing gas tanks in blowers, cleaning carburetors, and much, much more. The articles include detailed, step-by-step descriptions, pictures, and video to ensure you never get lost during a repair again. 

If you don’t find a solution there, visit our forums. You can register in minutes, and once you do, you’ll have thousands of posts at your fingertips. You can ask the community of DIY pros a question about your repair, share some of your own advice, or just chat about the DIY culture at large. With eReplacementParts.com, you never have to get lost during a repair again!

						Just wanted to say THANK YOU for sending me a replacement part. It's not a big purchase - just a fuel tank cap - but your responsiveness to my inquiry when I realized the original order never arrived was awesome! Thank you for your attention to details and willingness to make a customer very happy! It's the little things like this that creates a very satisfied customer - and I'll certainly be purchasing all the rest of my parts through you in the future. Well done.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
