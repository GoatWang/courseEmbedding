'Old Houses'

Holborn

etched and printed by hand by the artist

R. Herdman Smith

Robert Herdman-Smith; 1879-1945,  English painter and etcher of architectural subjects. Born in Liverpool and studied art in Leeds, London, Paris, Munich and Antwerp, Robert exhibited at the R.A., in the provinces, and at the Paris Salon. He travelled and painted on his worldwide travels. He took a position and taught at Wellington Technical School in New Zealand. Raymond Francis McIntyre was a student of Herdman-Smith at Canterbury School of Art.

This original colour etching has bright and unfaded colouring, printed in black ink, the image measuring approximately 21 cms. x 15 cms. (8¼ x 6 ins.) within a strong platemark and impression, on a wove paper sheet, 25 cms. x 18 cms. (9¾ x 7 ins.)

Signed in pencil in the lower margin, with a dedication in pencil on the reverse;

'To Miss S. Sampson with best wishes 1929, from Mrs & Mr R. Herdman Smith'

Unmounted and unframed, the condition of the image and sheet is good with a single fox spot in the upper image.
