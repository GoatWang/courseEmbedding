Robert J. Dolan is the Baker Foundation Professor at Harvard Business School. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester and began his academic career in 1976 as a faculty member at the Graduate School of Business of the University of Chicago. He joined the Harvard Business School faculty in 1980 and became the Edward W. Carter Professor of Business Administration. He served as the Chairman of the Marketing area from 1986 to 1994. He has also been a visiting professor at IESE in Barcelona, Spain.In 2001, he became the Dean of the University of Michigan Business School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The School offered the broadest portfolio of degree programs among the leading business schools with the following degrees: Bachelor's of Business Administration, MBA (offered in five different formats - Day, Evening, Weekend, Executive and Global), Master's in Supply Chain Management, Master's in Accounting, and Ph.D.  In addition, the School collaborated with two schools at the University to offer two joint Master's programs - the Erb Program in Sustainability (joint with the School of Natural Resources and Environment) and the Tauber Program on Global Operations (joint with the College of Engineering).Under Dolan's leadership, the School embarked on a strategy of differentiation via a focus on action-based learning where teams of students undertook field-based projects under the supervision of the faculty. For MBA students, this took the form of the Multidisciplinary Action Project (MAP) program in which two months at the end of the first year required courses were dedicated to working on high level projects with leading companies around the world. To afford students an opportunity for a global experience, over half the projects were outside the United States. These projects were deliberately not pre-defined for the students, affording them the opportunity to define issues and operate in an "opportunity sensing" rather than just "problem solving" mode. As a result of these investments in innovative action-learning programs, the School was twice named the Best MBA Program in the world by the Wall Street Journal, based on their polling of recruiters. The Aspen Institute recognized the school as the best in training on issues of sustainability. To obtain the financial resources to support this strategy and the needed infrastructure, the School embarked on a Capital Campaign, raising nearly $400 million, including the $100 million dollar gift obtained by Dolan from Stephen M Ross, a New York real estate developer. At the time, it was the largest gift ever made to a business school and still is the largest ever given to the University of Michigan. The Schools is now known as the Ross School of Business. While at Michigan, Dolan was also President of the William Davidson Institute for Global Economies and the Zell-Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies. He was also special counsel to the Provost on Visioning the future at the University.An expert in marketing and, in particular, issues of pricing and new product development, Dolan has authored or coauthored eight books and has published in a wide variety of journals including the Harvard Business Review, Marketing Science and the Journal of Marketing. His case studies and technical notes developed at Harvard Business School are among the most widely used in academia, selling over 2.5 million copies. One of his cases, Sealed Air Corporation, with sales of over 300,000 copies, was recently designated by Harvard as one of the three "classics" in the Harvard collection. He has consulted with and provided executive education for leading firms throughout the world including General Electric, IBM and Henkel. He also was the marketing expert in several of the landmark cases tried in the United States including for Polaroid in its award of over $1 billion for patent infringement from Kodak and for the Justice Department of the United States in its actions against the tobacco companies. He has been on the board of directors of four publicly traded companies. He is currently working on his ninth book on contemporary marketing issues.Print Entire ProfileLess

A Simulation Analysis of Alternative Pricing Strategies for Dynamic Environments
Robert J. Dolan
Researchers of the strategic implications of the well-known demand (e.g., adoption and diffusion) and supply (e.g., experience effects) dynamics have typically sought analytical solutions. Their success in this has been achieved partly by limiting the richness of the dynamics considered. This paper describes a simulation modeling capability. SIMSTRAT, which trades off analytical solutions for richer, more realistic representations of supply and demand. We present the model and then the results of our initial investigations using SIMSTRAT. When joined with new computer graphics capabilities, the model is successful in identifying conditions conducive to skim- and penetration-pricing strategies.

CNS Worldwide
Robert J. Dolan and Karthik Easwar
CNS Worldwide has long been the market share leader in the IaaS cloud server market, yet it has remained unprofitable for years. Industry capacity utilization is low, and prices have declined over 70% over the last decade. CNS is considering withdrawing from the market if it cannot find a way to increase prices. As a large public bid is about to be held, CNS must decide whether to bid and, if so, at what price. This case is intended for use in an introductory marketing management course that involves an in-depth analysis of pricing. It can also be used in courses on pricing, business-to-business (B2B) sales, or competitive strategy. The case introduces students to specialized pricing mechanisms, oligopolistic markets, the challenges of avoiding a price war, the concept of price leadership, and the possible effects of a firm taking this role, including what it needs to do to succeed. There is a direct analogy to the airline industry that can be discussed during the last part of the class.

Casper Sleep Inc.: Marketing the 'One Perfect Mattress for Everyone'
Robert J. Dolan
“A Warby Parker of mattresses? Somebody is going to do it. Why not us?” 

This was the topic of a conversation begun in spring 2013 among Gabe Flateman, Philip Krim, Neil Parikh, and T. Luke Sherwin. The four met as members of a New York City venture accelerator program. All admired Warby Parker’s success in delivering on the promise of “designer eyewear at revolutionary prices,” via a direct-to-consumer sales model. “Big Mattress,” their term for the current manufacturer/retailer system, featured not only high prices, but also, as they would describe to many in the days ahead, "one of the worst buying experiences in the world."

Angie's List: Ratings Pioneer Turns 20
Robert J. Dolan and Ayelet Israeli
In 1995, before people “googled” or “yelped,” Angela Hicks (HBS, 2000) was establishing her Angie’s List as a pioneer in the accumulation and dissemination of consumer rating information. Hicks focused on the home repair and maintenance market and, as she put it, “particularly on high cost of failure situations where good information on potential service providers is correspondingly of high value.” Angie's List had a paid subscription model as it charged “members” for access to the information they collectively provided on service providers.

More recently, companies such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google have started offering free access to their reviews while relying totally on site advertising and service provider fees for their revenues. In 2015, Angie's List collected close to $68 million in membership fees. In January 2016, with recent declines in the growth rate of member numbers, Angie’s List has to decide if it was time to drop the “paid subscription for all” model and introduce a free version of its service to its product line.

Planters Nuts
Robert J. Dolan and Donald K. Ngwe
In 2012 Planters had about $1 billion in U.S. annual revenues, but had experienced declining unit sales and household penetration over the past six years. The snack nuts category was growing overall, but household spending was shifting away from peanuts, cashews, and mixed nuts—Planters’ core business—to almonds and pistachios. A new brand management team for Planters had to develop a plan to reinvigorate the still largest brand in the category, and specifically to decide whether to focus on rebuilding its traditional product categories or on attempting to capitalize on the newer nut categories. Central to this process were questions of segmentation, targeting, and positioning.

StepSmart Fitness
Robert J. Dolan, Benson P. Shapiro and Alisa Zalosh
StepSmart Fitness, a manufacturer of exercise equipment, is undergoing a sweeping reorganization. The new CEO has terminated the District Sales Director and Regional VP and promoted 30-year-old Benjamin Cooper to manage the underperforming New England district. A first-time manager with no one to train him or explain the causes of the district's underperformance, Cooper has 10 weeks to diagnose the problems and make recommendations that will ensure a turnaround in the territory in less than 16 months. Left to his own devices, Cooper must review the sales data, the incomplete notes left by his predecessor, and his own thoughts after spending a day in the field with each sales person. Then he must make decisions about termination or probation for current employees, the hiring of additional salespeople, ways to increase productivity, and potential new methods of evaluating salesperson performance. He is set to present his conclusions to his also-newly-appointed manager, the Regional VP for the Northeast, in a few days.

In a Bind: Peak Sealing Technologies' Product Line Extension Dilemma
Robert J. Dolan and Heather Beckham
Peak Sealing Technologies (PST), a manufacturer of premium carton sealing tapes, stresses technological innovation as the company's core value. But when a new regional competitor introduces a less expensive and inferior product, PST is faced with a decision that could conflict with their values. Product manager Emma Taylor must decide if the company should augment its existing high-quality product line with a cheaper, less effective product to compete with their competitor. However, this decision could cannibalize PST's premium line. Emma is faced with a key issue in product line management—determining the variety of products in the line that serve the same function. Students are introduced to the problems of "trading down" the product line and must consider whether the company's corporate values are a strength or liability. This case can be used effectively in a first-year MBA course on marketing management to illustrate concepts associated with the risk and strategy of introducing a product line extension. It also allows for more complex analysis that would be appropriate in an Executive MBA program or advanced MBA elective courses in Product Management, Business to Business Marketing, Sales Management or New Product Development.

Outotec (B): Action Plan
Robert J. Dolan and Doug J. Chung
Outotec was a market leader in providing mining solutions to large mining companies. The
company's specialization and proprietary technology created value for its customers and helped the firm differentiate from its competitors. Yet, Outotec was not pricing or marketing its solutions in a way that took advantage of its distinct capabilities and value-add. Outotec used a cost-based (inside/out) pricing policy, which was the industry norm. As a result, operating profit was only 8% of sales and the CEO had promised the investment community improvements above 10%. The company and particularly the newly hired VP of Market Operations want to move from a cost-based (inside/out) to a value-based (outside/in) pricing and selling model to capture more profitable revenues and meet profitability targets the CEO announced to investors. But there are several challenges to this, which the case study highlights for students to discuss and debate.

Altius Golf and the Fighter Brand
Robert J. Dolan and Sunru Yong
Altius Golf is the clear leader in the golf ball market despite a long-term decline in the number of golfers and a drop in sales following the financial crisis. The firm has maintained its position by introducing generations of advanced, super-premium golf balls that allow their customers to emulate professional golfers. The company has been losing market share to lower-priced competitors and the CEO wants to introduce a new program called Elevate to foster the next generation of golfers. With Elevate, the firm will introduce a ball that is more forgiving and easier to drive for distance and offer it at a price 40% below the company's flagship brand. Elevate will be available through "off-course" channels such as golf specialty stores and big box retailers instead of "on-course" pro shops where the firm typically sells its products. The board of directors is divided on whether to support the decision. Students must perform a quantitative analysis of the CEO's proposal to understand the potential risks and gains before making a final recommendation.

Launching the BMW Z3 Roadster
Robert J. Dolan and Susan M. Fournier
James McDowell, vice president of marketing at BMW North America, Inc., must design Phase II communication strategies for the launch of the new BMW Z3 Roadster. The program follows an "out-of-the-box" prelaunch campaign centered on the placement of the product in the November 1996 James Bond hit movie, "GoldenEye", and including other "nontraditional" elements such as a product appearance on Jay Leno's Tonight Show, an offering of a Bond Edition Roadster in the Neiman Marcus Christmas Catalog, and large-scale public relations activities. McDowell must assess the effectiveness of the prelaunch activities and design marketing tactics that can sustain product excitement until product availability in March. Includes color exhibits.

John J. Dolan, Jr., 58, fourth generation New Canaanite

By New Canaan Advertiser on March 20, 2017 in News, Obituaries · 2 Comments




It is with the ultimate sadness and the heaviest of hearts that the caring family of John J. Dolan, Jr. announces and mourns his passing at age 58 after a brave struggle with Parkinson’s disease. John was a 4th generation New Canaanite with an artist’s heart and a genuinely compassionate personality that always sought and found the goodness in others regardless as to their station in life. Kindness towards all was his “Modus Operandi.”
John graduated from New Canaan High School in 1977. During high school, he played lacrosse and operated a successful hauling and tree service. It was during this time that John discovered Long Island and surfing: two loves that remained with him for the rest of his life. He attended Bryant University in Rhode Island, graduating in 1982 and afterwards, lived and surfed in Sag Harbor and Bridgehampton Long Island, where he ran a respected landscaping concern. He also spent time living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many remember John for his red trucks which he used to haul brush, as well as his surfboards. John renovated several homes in Ridgefield and New Canaan teaching himself the art of construction. As with much in life, John was largely self-taught, evolving from a furniture maker to a master builder.
Always compassionate toward the young, John worked as an instructor for Outward Bound, teaching life skills to troubled youth through outdoor activities and kayaking. John’s adventurous nature and love of surfing took him across the globe. The ski slopes of Aspen Colorado, the woods of Vermont and Maine the beaches of California, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, Mexico, Bali, Australia, Martha’s Vineyard and coastal Rhode Island were just a few of the many places that John could be found. Everywhere John went, he developed lifelong friendships and touched people’s lives.
It was in Costa Rica that John’s heart settled down, specifically in the Santa Teresa/Mal Pais area on the Nicoya Peninsula. There John combined his love of surfing and building and for 20 years lived a life of adventure and dedication to a vision – the creation of an incredible one-of-a-kind boutique hotel and retreat he aptly named “Casa Verde.” John, in the vein of other visionaries and knowing no bounds, took
a raw piece of land perched on a steep hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean and carved out the foundations for Casa Verde, from which many beautiful ocean sunsets were enjoyed. It was his personal “Buena Vista.” Acting as his own architect and engineer, he designed and built, from the ground up, a living monument to his ability, taste and style. Every inch of the property – from the intricate mosaics to the hand sanded rafters – reflect John’s personality, high craftsmanship and dedication to his art. Every piece of furniture within Casa Verde was designed by John and built by hand. John poured his life and spirit into Casa Verde where his presence is palpable.
John’s legacy in Costa Rica is not limited to the structures at Casa Verde. A man of intense artistry, skill and passion, John remained humble and kind. He built more than walls: he fostered the growth and development of the dozens of men who labored alongside him over the years. Those fortunate enough to work with “Juan” learned valuable trades and skills which have improved their lives and the lives of their families. In Santa Teresa he touched the lives of many of the locals. People said “John always had time to stop and talk, to ask after me and my family, to offer to help us if needed.” His passing has left a large hole in the heart of the community.
John was deeply committed to his family, particularly his nephews Rob Campbell (Mary), Peter Campbell (Jill), Matt Campbell, Jamie Dolan, Jack Dolan, and his nieces Riley Dolan and Audrey Dolan. The next generation of great nieces and nephews, Caroline Campbell, Lily Campbell, Connor Campbell and Kate Campbell brought him much joy. His Project Manager’s young son, Josue, also occupied a special place in his heart. All brought him tremendous joy and were his “Raison de Etre.” John relished their deep friendships and accomplishments, taking great pride in imparting all of his worldly wisdom upon them.
John was preceded in death by his father John J. Dolan, Esq. and is survived by his mother Marianne Kaiser Dolan of New Canaan, his sisters Meg Campbell (Rob) of Wilton, Marianne K. Dolan of New York City, his brothers Peter Dolan (Julie) of Basalt, Colorado and Chris Dolan (Julie) of San Rafael, California. He touched the lives of hundreds of people whom he befriended along his journeys, always leaving a little of himself behind with each of them. Although his mortal life has come to an end, his spirit, cast far and wide, lives within the hearts of all who knew him.
No funeral or memorial service is planned by the family. In lieu of flowers, those inclined can make a donation to the National Parkinson’s Foundation in John’s Memory. The family welcomes all interested to journey to Costa Rica and experience the beauty he created there.

John is sadly missed……we built together, laughed and cried together and shared his special appreciation of life in all its forms.  I will think of him fondly often….

Dolan, Harvard University, Graduate School of Business Administration, Soldiers Field, Boston, MA 02163.AbstractMany companies regularly use beta tests as part of their product development program. Beta testing can validate the product concept, eliminate performance problems prior to market introduction, and serve as an effective sales promotion device. The risks are significant, however, in that a poorly designed test can destroy account relationships, generate inaccurate data on product performance, and stimulate negative publicity. Robert Dolan and John Matthews present guidelines for effective management of beta test programs. They develop these guidelines based on a literature review, an analysis of twenty-one beta test programs as described in secondary sources, and four in-depth field investigations with cooperating firms.

La Fiere Bridge











The following letter is from John "Red
        Dog" Dolan, Company Commander of A Company 505 PIR, to General James Gavin.  
        Wriiten in 1959, at the urging of Robert Murphy, the letter provides a very detailed
        account of A Company's legendary actions at La Fiere Bridge. General Gavin's transmittal
        letter to famed author Cornelius Ryan is also enclosed. 


JOHN J. DOLAN
        ATTORNEY AT LAW
        BOX 1272,  141 MILK STREET
        BOSTON 4,  MASS.


 March 15, 1959
 
Lt. General James N. Gavin 
        c/o Arthur D. Little, Inc.
        30 Memorial Drive
        Cambridge, Mass.
Dear General Gavin:
    Thank you for your letter of March 10, 1959. It had always been my
        intention of answering the questionnaire of Cornelius Ryan; but realizing that it would
        take considerable time to give a detailed and accurate account, I kept putting it aside
        and then completely forgot about it until Bob Murphy spoke to me about it a few days
        before receipt of your letter.
    I shall try to cover as much detail without making this letter too
        voluminous, leaving it to your judgment and discretion to delete any portion that you deem
        unfavorable to the outfit. You may recall that I was in command of Company "A",
        505 Parachute Infantry, with the rank of First Lieutenant. The specific mission of the
        Company "A" was to seize and defend the bridge crossing the Merderet River on
        the road that ran East to West from Ste. Mere Eglise, with the purpose of preventing the
        movement of German troops down to the beach-head.
    I dont recall exactly what time the first Battalion jumped but
        it was between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. on D-Day. We hit our drop zone right on the nose,
        because within twenty minutes to one-half hour, I knew our exact location. I was able to
        identify a "T" intersection, dirt roads 8 to 10 feet wide, near our drop zone.
        The upper arm of which ran generally east to west, the vertical arm running north to
        south, to meet the road running from Ste. Mere Eglise to our objective, the bridge at the
        Merderet River.
    We had the usual problems of re-organization in the dark; however,
        about an hour before dawn, Company "A" moved out from the drop zone with about
        ninety (90) per cent of the men accounted for. (This was not due to luck alone, but to the
        cooperation of Officers, Non-Coms, and last but not least, training. Men who have to fight
        in the night should be trained in nighttime fighting, not just taken on a night march
        and digging foxholes.) We moved along this dirt road which I previously referred to
        as being the North-South arm of the "T" intersection, and just around here, I
        ran into Major McGinity. He moved out with us.
    The order of march was first, Co. Headquarters, third and second
        platoons in that order. When we reached the road running East-West from Ste. Mere Eglise,
        a German motorcycle passed us going toward Ste. Mere Eglise. At this time, it was still
        dark, but daylight was starting to break. We crossed the road and started west toward the
        bridge,with a hedge row to our right between us and the road. Just about this time,
        contact was lost with the first platoon, so the third platoon took the lead.
    About seven to eight hundred yards from the bridge, we came upon a
        dirt road running southeasterly from the road to the bridge. Hedgerows were on either side
        of this road; and beyond it in the direction of the bridge, was an open, flat field, about
        100 yards deep and about 75 yards wide. It was here that I figured the Germans would
        defend if they intended a defense of the bridge.
    I directed Lt. Donald Coxon to send his scouts out. This he did, and
        he also went out with them. He had plenty of personal courage but he didnt have the
        heart to order them out without going with them.
    A few moments later, a German machine gun opened up, killing Lt.
        Coxon and one of his scouts, Fergueson. Their fire was returned; and, with Major McGinity
        and myself leading, a few men holding and returning frontal fire, the platoon flanked to
        the left. At the same time, I directed Lt. Presnell to re-cross the road and attack along
        the northern side down to the bridge. This was done, and the second platoon didn't meet
        with any fire until they arrived at the bridge.
    The third platoon continued its flanking move and cut back in toward
        the road to the bridge. Because of the fire, we calculated that there was just one machine
        gun crew that was in our way. It later turned out that there must have been at least a
        squad dug in at this point, with at least two of them armed with machine pistols.
        Prisoners captured later, in addition to the German dead, amounted to about the size of
        one of our platoons. There were no German officers captured. I dont know whether or
        not any of their enlisted men escaped.
    To continue, we cut back toward the road, travelling in a Northerly
        direction. Major McGinity was leading and I was about three or four paces behind,
        and slightly to the right. There was a high, thick hedgerow to our left, and it was in
        here that I figured the machine gun was located.
    When we had traveled about two-thirds of the way up the hedgerow,
        they opened up on us with rifle, and at least two machine pistols. I returned the fire
        with my Thompson Sub-Machine Gun at a point where I could see leaves in the hedgerow
        fluttering. Major McGinity was killed instantly. As luck would have it, there was a German
        foxhole to my left which I jumped into and from where I continued to fire I could only
        guess where to shoot, but I had to as part of the Third platoon was exposed to their fire.
        Lt. McLaughlin, the assistant platoon leader was wounded and died later that day. His
        radio operator was also killed the platoon by now was under fire from two directions, from
        the point where I was pinned down, and also from the direction of the bridge.
    I cant estimate how long we were pinned down in this fashion,
        but it was at least an hour. I made several attempts to move, but drew their fire. On my
        last attempt, I drew no fire. They obviously had pulled out. During all of this time, I
        could hear rifle and machine gunfire down by the bridge on the north side. This ceased
        about this time I returned to the rest of the third platoon, instructed the Non-Coms to
        re-organize and to maintain their present position. I then crossed the road and located
        the first platoon commanded by Lt. Oakley on the north side. They were moving toward the
        bridge, so I instructed them to continue and dig in on the right side. I went down to the
        bridge and found that we had received an assist from some of the 508 Prcht. Infantry about
        this time, I ran into Col. Eckman, and sent for my third platoon to dig in on the left or
        south side of the bridge. The first was already digging in on the north side.


 I thought that all of the Germans had retreated;
        but unknown to us, there were about ten or twelve Germans holed up on the second floor of
        a stucco-type farmhouse. At the time they started firing. Col. Eckman and I were casually
        looking the situation over. It lasted about twenty minutes with about ten or twelve
        Germans surrendering. About a squad of men from the 508 made the actual capture.
    We dug in, the disposition of my Company as follows: First platoon
        on the north side of the road, the third on the south and the second in reserve, about 4OO
        yards back, so that it could also protect the rear.
    Major Kellam arrived at the bridge with Capt. Roysden, his S-3. He
        had most of his C.P. unit with him. I dont know whether or not a Battalion C.P. had
        ever been set up as planned, at least, I dont recall having had any communication
        with it. Down at the bridge now was most of Company "A", about one platoon or
        Company "B", a platoon of the Division Engineers (mission to blow the bridge if
        necessary), about half of Battalion Headquarters Company with mortars awl machine gun
        sections and several stray men from other regiments. The Company dug in well and quickly.
        I had just completed my inspection of the forward positions when we knew that an attack
        was coming. You will recall that in front of our position, west of the Merderet River, was
        a marsh at least 1000 yards wide at its narrowest point. The road running west from the
        bridge could better be described as a causeway.
    As I recall, the mission of the 508 was to occupy a position beyond
        this causeway. In addition to the men who assisted us in capturing the bridge at least a
        company of the 508 passed through our position and moved over the causeway to their
        objective. They were gone at least an hour when we saw several of them retreating back
        across the marsh. I remember that we helped several of them out of the river, which was
        quite shallow. 
    The machine gun fire from the Germans was very heavy by now. We
        didnt return their fire as there were no visible targets and our ammunition supply
        was limited. They attacked with three tanks, which I was unable to identify for sure; but
        they appeared to be similar to the German Mark IV type, or maybe a little lighter. The
        tanks were firing on us with machine guns and cannon.
    Just about a half-hour before this attack, a 57MM A. T. gun was
        assigned to Company "A". I located this gun about 150 yards from the bridge on
        the road where it curves to the right as you approach the bridge. Incidentally, this was
        my C.P. and later the Battalion C.P. This gave the gun excellent cover and a good field of
        fire. 
    On the bridge I had three bazooka teams. Two of them were from
        Company "A" and the third was either from "B" or "C"
        Company. The two Company "A" bazookas were dug in to the left and right of the
        bridge. Because of the fact that the road itself was the causeway type, they were as of
        necessity dug in below the level of the road, so that in order to fire, they had to get
        out of their foxholes. The third bazooka was over more to the south where better cover was
        available. 
    To continue, I had just completed my inspection of our defenses and
        was 40 to 50 yards from the bridge. Major Kellam and Captain Royaden were nearby. The
        first two tanks were within 15 Qr 20 yards of each other, the third was back about 50
        yards. When the lead tank was about 40 or 50 yards away from the bridge, the two Company
        "A" bazooka teams got up just like clock work to the edge of the road. They were
        under the heaviest small arms fire from the other side of the causeway, and from the
        cannon and machine gun fire from the tanks. To this day, Ill never be able to
        explain why all four of them were not killed. They fired and reloaded with the precision
        of well-oiled machinery. Watching them made it hard to believe that this was nothing but a
        routine drill. I dont think that either crew wasted a shot. The first tank received
        several direct hits. The treads were knocked off, and within a matter of minutes it was on
        fire. Then they went to work on the second tank, and within about 30 seconds, it was on
        fire. They fired every rocket that they had and then jumped into their foxholes. The 57mm
        during this time was firing and eventually knocked out the last tank. The gun crew did an
        excellent job.
    My two bazooka crews called for more ammunition. Major Kellam ran up
        toward the bridge with a bag of rockets followed by Captain Roysden. When they were within
        15 or 20 yards of the bridge, the Germans opened up with mortar fire on the bridge. Major
        Kellam was killed and Captain Roysden was rendered unconscious from the concussion. He
        died later that day. Both of the bazookas were destroyed by the mortar fire. Lt. Weir
        (Reg. Hq. Co.) and I carried Captain Roysden back. I then took over command of the
        battalion, being the senior officer present.
    Company "B" was put into reserve in the perimeter of
        Company "A", so that we had almost a 560 degree perimeter defense. The rest of
        the day we were under heavy mortar and machine gun fire. The mortar fire was very
        effective as against the two forward platoons because of tree bursts. It took very little
        imagination on the part of the Krauts to figure out just where we would be dug in. As I
        recall, there was less than a seventy-five yard frontage on either side of the bridge from
        where we could effectively defend, so they could throw their mortar fin in our general
        direction with good results. During the night, the fire let up, but they started early the
        next morning and kept it up. My third platoon took the worst beating, as they were in a
        heavier wooded area, (tree bursts). 
    The second tank attack came on the afternoon of the second day. I
        was over on the north side of the bridge with the first platoon. For about an hour before
        the attack, they increased their mortar fire to the extent that the third platoon was just
        about knocked out, but not quite. I was not aware of this at the time. In addition to
        already heavy casualties, Sgt. Monahan, the platoon Sgt. was fatally wounded.
     I learned second hand that some other troops had retreated
        through the third platoons position, and then through my C.P. Rumors were around
        that we were going to give up the bridge. As a result of this, the 57MM A.T. crew took
        off. I didnt have an Executive Officer at the time. Earlier that day, he (Tom Furey)
        was put in command of "C" Company. My First Sergeant was a jump casualty, so my
        Company Headquarters at the time was non-existent except for runners and radio operators.
        I cant recall why, but our radios were not working. The only way that we could
        communicate was through runners.
    The first platoon was under heavy fire also. The platoon leader, Lt.
        Oakley, who had been doing an excellent job, was fatally wounded, and Sgt. Ricci was
        leaving the junior squad leader, Sgt. Owens, in command. You will recall that we have had
        some communication about Sgt. Owens in the past as to his personal courage and the way he
        commanded the platoon at this most critical time. I recommended Sgt. Owens and my tour
        bazooka men for the D.S.C. The bazooka men were awarded the D.S.C., but Sgt. Owens was
        not. This is a story in itself. 
    The second attack was with two tanks and infantry. I was unable to
        estimate the size. The tanks stayed out of effective bazooka range. (We had one bazooka
        left.) Not hearing any fire from the 57MM, I went over to it and found it unmanned. I
        tried to fire it, but the crew had taken the firing mechanism. I organized five or six men
        behind the hedge on the southerly side of the road with Gammon grenades, and just about
        this time, two of the gun crew returned with the firing mechanism. They knocked out the
        two tanks. They were two youngsters not more than 17 or 18 years old, who returned on
        their own initiative. I recommended them for Silver Stars. 
    The rest of our stay at the bridge was uneventful, except for the
        continued mortar fire, and at the end, artillery fire which damaged the 57MM. Lt. Col.
        Mark Alexander took over command of the battalion later that day and continued to command
        it for most of the operation. Without exception, he was the finest battalion commander I
        ever served under. My second son, Mark Alexander Dolan, was named after him.


   In conclusion, we held the bridge until
        relieved. In Co. "A" alone, in those days (three in all), we had seventeen known
        dead and about three times that number wounded. The rest of the battalion also had heavy
        casualties.
     I have tried to give you an accurate picture of what happened
        however, after fifteen years, the foregoing may contain some minor inaccuracies I will be
        glad to give Mr. Ryan any additional information he may require. You may assure him that I
        will be happy to cooperate with him in every detail.
 
                                                    
        Very truly yours,
                                          
        




 JJD:eg
P.S. Since writing this Letter, I have read the account by David Howarth in the
            Saturday Evening Post, and I agree with you that it contains many inaccuracies. You will
            probably note that some of the events related tie in with what I have told you in this
            letter.
The most glaring inaccuracy is about the bridge being lost. For the record, this bridge
            was held by Company "A" from the time of its capture on "D" Day, until
            we were relieved.

Dear Connie:
I Just received the attached from Dolan. Frankly, it is the first time that I have ever
                gotten this much detail out of him. Although I was with him from beginning to end of the
                War, he was never much for talking about what happened. I hasten to send it off to you
                because I think that it is quite good. To the host of my knowledge it is accurate in every
                detail.
