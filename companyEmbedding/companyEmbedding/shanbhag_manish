Energizer Holdings is a consumer goods company operating globally in the broad categories of household and personal care products. We currently offer solutions in portable power, lighting, wet shave and personal grooming, skin care, feminine care and infant care.The origins of Energizer Holdings trace back to a couple of inventors. In 1896, W.H. Lawrence created the first consumer battery to power home telephones. Two years later, Conrad Hubert, a Russian immigrant, used these batteries to power his electric hand torch – the first flashlight. In 1905, the two innovators got together to form what was then known as The American Ever Ready Company. Nearly a century later, in 2015, Energizer Holdings, Inc. "keeps going". Through it all there has been one constant: a continued emphasis on innovation – from the launch of the Energizer® Inductive Charger to the world’s first AA battery made with 4% recycled batteries – Energizer® EcoAdvanced™.
