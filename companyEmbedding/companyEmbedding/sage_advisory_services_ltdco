Our focus? Our clients.

One of the best assets you can invest in is valuable relationships. For us, that's the relationships we build with our advisors, consultants and clients. Since 1996, we've crafted smart investment strategies centered on risk management and delivered through transparent communication. In this way, we responsibly guide our partners toward tailored, innovative investment solutions.







  

A Lasting Legacy
At Sage, we’ve sought often-overlooked, leading-edge solutions since we opened our doors decades ago, keeping the needs of our clients above all. This started by centering on liability-based asset management to serve clients’ fixed income needs. Through decades of market cycles and volatility, we secured consistent performance with traditional fixed income instruments. 
When clients asked us for equity alternatives, we identified Exchange Traded Funds as a critical part of the future investment landscape — and we were right. Today, we’re one of the largest tactical ETF managers in the country, serving the unique needs of institutional and private clients alike.

Our Austin Roots
We're headquartered in Austin, Texas, not Wall Street –– a difference that encompasses more than just miles. Sage is 100% employee-owned and independently operated, which gives us the autonomy to focus on client needs rather than outside constituents. Whether you're looking for a sound investment strategy or just a juicy sirlion, we're great at grilling up both.

(1 of 4)
We believe in purpose-driven investment solutions.
Just as the lives of each of our clients are different, so are the reasons they invest. We deliver solutions and services designed to help them understand and efficiently accomplish their unique goals. Clients don't invest just to beat a benchmark or outperform others. They do so because they have a specific objective or utility for their money. It's our job to manage that.





(2 of 4)
We believe in simplicity, liquidity and transparency.
Three words, powerful impact. We offer an unwavering focus on our investment philosophy and management process, leverage instruments to execute sound strategies — primarily cash bonds and highly liquid ETFs — and handle each of our clients’ assets within a separately managed account. What’s more, we consistently share thought leadership with partners and clients.





(3 of 4)
We believe in taking a risk-conscious approach.
By first assessing the worst-case scenarios from our clients’ perspectives, we can craft an investment strategy that’s easier to adhere to — because it’s rooted in a pragmatic, risk-conscious approach. We understand and appreciate the impact that volatility has on our clients’ investments, and their well-being. Managing that instability is at the forefront of our investment decisions.





(4 of 4)
We believe in keeping our clients well informed.
Our commitment to effective communication and education also has a pragmatic purpose. The more a client knows, the more he or she can stay on plan during volatile and uncertain market environments. We have a rich talent pool of professionals committed to sharing their expertise. They solve problems, then share their perspectives to deepen understanding.
