Tardio also has worked for companies in Texas, Mexico and South America. MIKE SIMONS / Tulsa World





























































1. You were just promoted to chief financial officer, replacing longtime executive Doug Fears, who is retiring. What is the biggest challenge of this new job, and how does a contract drilling company maintain fiscal stability when the pace of drilling rises and falls with steep price fluctuations?Doug is an extraordinary role model. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to thoroughly review the tasks and challenges at hand with him, and the transition has gone very well.The greatest challenge so far is identifying areas where we can create additional value. Maintaining fiscal stability is certainly a high priority. We believe we have the most capable land drilling fleet and organization in the industry, which has allowed us to generate premium margins and premium utilization rates, and has enabled us to secure a baseline of future earnings through firm, long-term contracts.2. Helmerich & Payne has been in business for 90 years. Is directional drilling the biggest innovation during that time, and will we see any similar "game changers" technology-wise in the near future?Directional drilling in the new shale plays has certainly been a game changer in the U.S. over the last five to 10 years. It has allowed natural gas reserves to unexpectedly become abundant in this country.Innovative technology applied to new and better drilling rigs, drill bits, fluids, directional drilling tools and frac completion methods have allowed highly productive gas shale wells to be drilled effectively and at a reasonable cost.Given our country's heavy dependence on crude oil imports, the next potential game changer may very well be cracking the code in more successfully exploiting oil and other liquids trapped in U.S. shale rock.3. What makes your company's FlexRig so different from competing rigs? Can you tell us a little about its evolution?The difference is productivity and reliability. A customer will achieve significant cost savings per well if our product can significantly reduce the time that it takes to drill the well. FlexRigs have demonstrated the ability to improve drilling productivity and in many cases help our customers attain significant cost savings.The FlexRig story takes us back to 1998, when Helmerich & Payne completed its first generation of these drilling units. During the last decade, three additional generations were introduced, all of which focused on applying innovative technology to make the drilling process more efficient. We also focused significant efforts on additional safety features and on improving the rig's ability to move more quickly from well to well.

4. Venezuela has devalued its currency and still owes H&P more than $40 million. Would the company ever consider pulling out of Venezuela entirely?We have reduced our number of rigs in Venezuela by half since 1998. At that time, almost 30 percent of our land rigs were in that country, compared to under 5 percent of our land rigs today.We decided not to enter new contracts in Venezuela last year given invoice payment delays by our customer, PDVSA. As a result, the 11 rigs that we have in that country — all of which are older conventional rigs — are now idle.Our future in Venezuela will depend on evolving market conditions there and around the world.5. So many energy-sector companies have either merged or moved out of Tulsa to Houston. Are there any factors that could compel H&P to move?For almost a century the Helmerich & Payne family has established deep roots within this community, and I can't think of any compelling reason that would drive our corporate offices away from Tulsa.
