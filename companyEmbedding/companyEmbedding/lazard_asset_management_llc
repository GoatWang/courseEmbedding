We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.
                  
To find out, take this short RIA self-assessment quiz.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                  

                    For additional information on regulation and registering as an RIA, read At a Glance: Legal and Regulatory Considerations for Becoming an RIA.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.
                  

Read the Info Sheet >

















            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.

Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            See the answer

Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.

Going independent.



“Clients have to come before quotas.”


They do. Here’s why.
If I’m going to work for someone, it’s going to be my clients. By going independent, I truly felt I could put them first.
Brittany Albert, Lincoln Capital




“Our fear: Clients wouldn’t follow.”


They did. Here’s why.
The myth about going independent is that you can’t provide what your clients are used to. But we actually had more options and fewer constraints to help our clients achieve their goals than ever before.
Don Garman, Mirador Capital Partners




“We feared we’d have less to offer.”


We had more. Here’s why.
You hear about all the things you are limited to as an independent. But the opposite is true. We not only had access to more unique products, but we could offer them at lower prices.
Trevor Callan, Callan Capital








What it means to go independent.
More and more financial advisors are choosing to start their own independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firms or join one. By leaving the traditional wirehouse, RIAs gain the freedom and control to run their own business and provide the kind of service their clients expect. Here are some of the advantages:

Be your own boss and shape your business terms the way you want. 
Increase your income potential—as an RIA, you have 100% control of your payout.
Gain greater control over how you can market to and communicate with clients.
Access more technology options for scaling your business and creating your client experience.

Get more details. Download our in-depth white paper Exploring Independence   .









Now’s the time to make the move.
There has been strong growth in the independent model in recent years. The reason? Advisors are seeing greater opportunities for themselves and their clients. Technology is constantly improving. And there are more options for running a business and customizing the client experience. Most importantly, clients are seeing the value of putting more trust in independent RIAs.
As a result, the numbers speak for themselves.














Project your earning potential. Test different business scenarios using the RIA Economic Discovery Tool.









How to transition with as few obstacles as possible.
Starting or joining an RIA firm can be a big change, but it doesn’t have to be a difficult one. As the market leader and a champion of the independent advisor model, Schwab Advisor Services™ knows the steps to take and can help you make the transition to an RIA.

Video Transcript
We manage all of the assets of our firm in house. We have grown our business through family, friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such. 
Choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us. 
The day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue, the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job. 
Schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets. They really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients. 
Schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition. Transitioning a business is never easy, it’s never without stress. One of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance. When we moved to Schwab they had a team that came in, they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful. 
Communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected. They said, “Well do you really think it’s the right thing for me?” And we could say unequivocally yes. 
I have the ability to manage money any way that I see fit. 
Clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before. 
The clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had. Business owners respond to other business owners. Our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history. I consider this more than just a business, you know we consider it like a large extended family. 
It’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel. The ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine, you know if we do that. 
There’s tons of freedom being independent, um with the technology you have access to, you can work from anywhere and still get great results. 
So the fact that I can do my job wherever I need to be has allowed us to travel more, spend more time. I try to work from home 1 to 2 days, maybe 3 days a month. 
Because I now run my own business I have that freedom now to do what I think is best for me and my family. 
Don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and long-term, you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally. 
We don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile. 
Being independent isn’t for everybody, you have to have the right business mix but if you do, I think with the way the industry’s changing, you should look into it and you should probably look into it as soon as possible.

Over the past couple of years, persistently low inflation has concerned policymakers and investors. More recently, however, expectations have reached an inflection point as higher inflation will be a key risk going forward. Ron Temple, Co-Head of Multi-Asset and Head of US Equity, reviews recent inflation trends, where inflation stands today, and how to defend capital against inflation risks.

We are subject to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement explains how we protect the privacy of your personal information under the APPs. It also sets out the matters that we are required to explain to individuals under APP5. The principles set out in this document apply to any personal information we collect about you, whether you provide it to us via our web site or other method or under any agreement or arrangement with us and to information which we might collect about you from other sources.
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement does not apply to acts and practices of Lazard Pacific which relate directly to the employee records of Lazard Pacific’s current and former employees.
How we collect and hold personal information
We generally collect your personal information directly from you. For example, we may collect personal information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, (including recordings of those telephone conversations of which we have made you aware), send us correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email) or contact us through our web site, subscribe electronically to our web site/publications if available, or when you have contact with us in person. We also collect personal information about you, when you apply for a position with us.
Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you includes your name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other personal information required to identify you for the purposes of Australian anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. We may also collect your username and password to log in to our website and the organisation for which you work, your position in the organisation and the dealings we have had with you during your employment with that organisation. In certain circumstances, we may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about membership of a professional or trade association, or membership of a trade union or police records of prospective employees. We may also collect your tax file number and other details in relation to your taxation position, when you make an application for one of our products.
There may be occasions when we need to source personal information about you from a third party. For example, we may collect personal information from a company for whom you work, other organisations with whom you have any dealings, a recruitment agency, a credit-reporting agency in relation to employment checks, an information service provider or from a publicly maintained record.
We may also collect web site visitors' contact information (like their e-mail addresses). We utilise "cookies" which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.
You may choose not to identify yourself, or to use a pseudonym when you deal with us. However we will need to identify you if we are required or authorised by Australian law, (such as anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation), or a court/tribunal order to do so or if it is impracticable for us to deal with you if you are not identified.
Purposes of collection
Lazard Pacific collects personal information for any one or some of the following purposes:

to provide you or your organisation with information about our product offerings;
to service our relationship with you, including managing your investments, responding to complaints or dispute you may have about our services and providing you with information from time to time about your investments;
to consider making offers of employment or for employment purposes;

We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.
                  

Read the Info Sheet >

















            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.
                    








            “Will my clients come with me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer
When clients think of your current firm, they think of you.

                    Industry research reports show that clients are loyal to their advisors, and nearly 80% of clients were immediately on board with the move.1


                    “It was seamless, and we had no complaints at all from any clients in this transition.”—Chris Baker

            “Can I keep my commission-based business?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.

            “Will I be able to choose my own technology?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey






                      Learn more about the benefits that advisor Fran Hoey experienced in choosing his firm’s technology.
                    















            “What kind of startup costs are involved?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You built your client relationships on excellent service. As an independent advisor at an RIA firm, you should expect the same high level of support from your custodian.
                  

                    With Schwab, you’ll have dedicated service and support teams to help you with firm operations and business growth, plus access to best practices, industry events, and many other resources.

Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.

Going independent.



“Clients have to come before quotas.”


They do. Here’s why.
If I’m going to work for someone, it’s going to be my clients. By going independent, I truly felt I could put them first.
Brittany Albert, Lincoln Capital




“Our fear: Clients wouldn’t follow.”


They did. Here’s why.
The myth about going independent is that you can’t provide what your clients are used to. But we actually had more options and fewer constraints to help our clients achieve their goals than ever before.
Don Garman, Mirador Capital Partners




“We feared we’d have less to offer.”


We had more. Here’s why.
You hear about all the things you are limited to as an independent. But the opposite is true. We not only had access to more unique products, but we could offer them at lower prices.
Trevor Callan, Callan Capital








What it means to go independent.
More and more financial advisors are choosing to start their own independent Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) firms or join one. By leaving the traditional wirehouse, RIAs gain the freedom and control to run their own business and provide the kind of service their clients expect. Here are some of the advantages:

Be your own boss and shape your business terms the way you want. 
Increase your income potential—as an RIA, you have 100% control of your payout.
Gain greater control over how you can market to and communicate with clients.
Access more technology options for scaling your business and creating your client experience.

Get more details. Download our in-depth white paper Exploring Independence   .









Now’s the time to make the move.
There has been strong growth in the independent model in recent years. The reason? Advisors are seeing greater opportunities for themselves and their clients. Technology is constantly improving. And there are more options for running a business and customizing the client experience. Most importantly, clients are seeing the value of putting more trust in independent RIAs.
As a result, the numbers speak for themselves.














Project your earning potential. Test different business scenarios using the RIA Economic Discovery Tool.









How to transition with as few obstacles as possible.
Starting or joining an RIA firm can be a big change, but it doesn’t have to be a difficult one. As the market leader and a champion of the independent advisor model, Schwab Advisor Services™ knows the steps to take and can help you make the transition to an RIA.

Video Transcript
We manage all of the assets of our firm in house. We have grown our business through family, friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such. 
Choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us. 
The day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue, the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job. 
Schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets. They really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients. 
Schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition. Transitioning a business is never easy, it’s never without stress. One of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance. When we moved to Schwab they had a team that came in, they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful. 
Communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected. They said, “Well do you really think it’s the right thing for me?” And we could say unequivocally yes. 
I have the ability to manage money any way that I see fit. 
Clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before. 
The clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had. Business owners respond to other business owners. Our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history. I consider this more than just a business, you know we consider it like a large extended family. 
It’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel. The ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine, you know if we do that. 
There’s tons of freedom being independent, um with the technology you have access to, you can work from anywhere and still get great results. 
So the fact that I can do my job wherever I need to be has allowed us to travel more, spend more time. I try to work from home 1 to 2 days, maybe 3 days a month. 
Because I now run my own business I have that freedom now to do what I think is best for me and my family. 
Don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and long-term, you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally. 
We don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile. 
Being independent isn’t for everybody, you have to have the right business mix but if you do, I think with the way the industry’s changing, you should look into it and you should probably look into it as soon as possible.

Your independence. Supported by Schwab.
The RIA industry is our history and our future—we’re in it for the long haul. Schwab helped pioneer the RIA industry when we launched our custody services 30 years ago, and we’ve helped lead the evolution of the model ever since. RIAs account for nearly half of Schwab’s total assets. That’s over $1 trillion managed by independent advisors.7
We have a solid foundation built on a diversified business model and a proven track record. More than 7,000 independent RIAs choose Schwab Advisor Services for trading and for operational and custody support. Our local service model; the strength of the Schwab brand; access to a range of insights, resources, and events; and our business consulting services are just some of the reasons why.

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes

Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
