Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc Announces Launch of European Named Patient Programme for Sodium Thiosulfate for Pediatric Patients with Standard Risk Hepatoblastoma
May 30 17
Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the launch of a Named Patient Programme (NPP) in Europe for STS. Fennec's NPP is intended to make STS available to patients before commercial availability in certain countries. Where mechanisms exist and in accordance with local regulations, Fennec will make STS available for pediatric patients with Standard Risk Hepatoblastoma. While Platinum based chemotherapy remains the most frequently prescribed treatment for many childhood cancers it causes hearing loss in a significant proportion of cases, with younger patients more at risk where the incidence can be over 70%. The social and economic consequences of hearing loss in children can be devastating. There is no preventative treatment and many survivors of childhood cancer require expensive and technically difficult cochlear (inner ear) implants or hearing aids that often provide suboptimal benefit. Additionally the costs of educational and lifetime support from social services may place an additional burden on society that could be reduced with an effective preventative therapy. STS has been studied by cooperative groups in two Phase 3 clinical studies of reduction of ototoxicity, the COG ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. Both studies are closed to recruitment. COG ACCL0431 final results were published in The Lancet Oncology in December 2016. SIOPEL 6 initial results will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017. Pending favorable SIOPEL 6 results, Fennec intends to file NDA/MAA submissions for STS.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:
            
1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              The case against two traders in the infamous “London Whale” case appears to have fallen apart after the Whale himself, considered a key witness, accused J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon of setting him up as a fall guy.

Description




Fennec Pharmaceuticals Inc., formerly Adherex Technologies Inc., is a biopharmaceutical company focused on cancer therapeutics. The Company's lead product candidate in the clinical stage of development includes Sodium Thiosulfate (STS), which has completed patient enrollment of over two Phase III clinical trials for the prevention of cisplatin induced hearing loss, or ototoxicity in children. STS has been studied by cooperative groups in over two Phase III clinical studies of survival and reduction of ototoxicity, The Clinical Oncology Group Protocol ACCL0431 and SIOPEL 6. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) ACCL0431 protocol enrolled 20% childhood cancers typically treated with intensive cisplatin therapy for localized and disseminated disease, including hepatoblastoma, germ cell tumor, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. SIOPEL 6 enrolled only hepatoblastoma patients with localized tumors.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."
