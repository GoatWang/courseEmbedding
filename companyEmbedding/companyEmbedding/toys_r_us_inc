My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

            what our team members say        






Silvia
HRIS Analyst
Global Resource Center, Wayne, NJ

We are all committed to making this a great place to work and we are always finding new ways to challenge how to be better.








Ross
IT Technical Analyst
Global Resource Center, Wayne, NJ

I’ve always been a Toys“R”Us kid and it’s really great working for the company. I’ve been here 9 years and I work with a great bunch of people which makes working here at Toys“R”Us more rewarding. 








Christine
Human Resources Department Supervisor
Toys“R”Us, Oceanside, CA 

I was hired during the 2010 holiday season, promoted to Front End Supervisor in 2014 and then again in 2015 to my current role of Human Resources Department Supervisor.
What Makes Me Unique: Having spent almost six years with the company, I felt like I’ve developed so much as a leader and as a person.
Favorite Toy: Arts and Crafts like easels, different markers and spirographs.
Favorite TRU Memories: When Larry, my store manager, had the confidence to put me at the service desk, and I got 40 Reward sign-ups that day during my first season. Also, last year was my first year hiring and staffing for holiday season, and I got to meet so many people from all walks of life with a strong desire to work for Toys“R”Us, including students, moms, Marines and even a mortician.
On Working at TRU: I love working for Toys“R”Us because my managers believe in me. We do a great job of training and developing our leaders, and we promote from inside the company, staying true to our brand. I would recommend it because we are the epitome of holiday spirit! Kids don’t want socks for Christmas. They want toys and that makes us cool. Plus, there’s not a single boring day on the job. 








Marlene
Seasonal Department Manager
Rialto, CA Distribution Center

I started as a temporary employee in February 2015 and in my short career have progressed to a Clerical Specialist and now this year I am happy to be a Seasonal Department Manager.  What Makes Me Unique: My personality! I don’t want to do the same thing that other people are doing because I like to stand out, especially in a group. I’m also the “funny aunt” that everyone loves to be around because they will always have a good time! Favorite Toy: Sofia the Giraffe teething ring  Favorite TRU Memories: We do a lot of team building events and parties! We had a softball team building game that I really enjoyed. Also, last holiday, we held an Ugly Sweater Contest and it was fun to see everyone’s festive choices.  On Working at TRU: I love working for TRU because I was given the opportunity to develop my experience. Managers both inside and outside of my division believed in me and gave me their full support, which is a great feeling. Based on my experience, this company is a great place to work. You get to learn new things and work with a lot of great people.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.

A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  Great, drove all the way for nothing.

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

First to Review
        


Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







Love the store. Nice employees and good location

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.

Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.

A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  Great, drove all the way for nothing.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  Great, drove all the way for nothing.

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.

The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.

Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.

A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  Great, drove all the way for nothing.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

First to Review
        


Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

My daughter loves to come in here and shop. I'm glad that they have a toy store in the mall. There's a lot of assorted toys for kids here. They also sell children's books. The sale items are also good. Great place to buy gifts for kids.







Got tons of gifts like little champssportscenter,Dino etc. as this place has good stuff.If you have time go to the one in foster city.One star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping  and offered very slow service at the cash counter.

Plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculous-u can't figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter.







The customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of Diane is very rude







A complete waste of time to come here.  First, it's not shown in the Great Mall's Directory, then when we finally found it across the food court; we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys.  Also I don't see any discount with it being an outlet store.  I came in with a coupon book with a list of toys I planned to get.  But they don't have any of it!!!  

Great, drove all the way for nothing.







I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  

I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.

Back to Target!







For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...

It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.







I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! 

Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!







The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! 

My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!

I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! 

THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!







Star Breakdown:

Service - 4 stars
Presentation - 4 stars
Quality/Selection - 1 star

This Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  

Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.







Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  

Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.







Love the store. Nice employees and good location







Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?

This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. 

Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.

Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.







Absolute jerks are the cashiers here. And the selection is crappy. Don't waste your time here.







This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece.  A strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance.  It was awfully cold inside the store.  I walked in and strolled one aisle at a time, looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys.  To my surprise, they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones I've seen at other stores.  In addition, their prices are expensive for an outlet store.Back to Target!

For an outlet, y'all got some prices that aren't close to being "outlet" price ...It's crowded, it's loud, it's dark and gloomy in here ... I'm already at the mall paying for overpriced things ... I might as well hit up the real Toys r Us heading back home.

I had to purchase tons of toys for our Kids Area. We needed big, durable toys. Jenna the Manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for. Being that we were going to carry tons of toys, she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart. What a great idea! Jenna was really helpful, made it so much easier for us! Thank you Jenna for the great customer service. Once these toys get destroyed (in a few months) we will be back!

The store & the store manager, Josh,in Hayward can kiss my arse! I've always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service & their lack of popular items! Now I ULTIMATELY HATE TOYS R US! THEIR STUPID "order online & pick up at the store" sucks big balls! I'm sorry for the vulgarity but seriously Toys R Us has to rethink their "instore pickup" policy! My father orders my 2yr old a gift online, gives me the order #, then I drive 10 miles to pick up the item, then I am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up! To top it all off the manager is a dick! doesn't even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father! Well maybe he shouldn't have because he would've gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of.  ALTHOUGH, I cussed him out & threw a middle finger up in the air! SCREW YOU JOSH for being rude!I called the 800# & cancelled the order! Never again will I deal with Toys R Us! They're over priced & rude! THIS HONESTLY DOES NOT DESERVE A STAR!!!!

Star Breakdown:Service - 4 starsPresentation - 4 starsQuality/Selection - 1 starThis Toys R Us has just moved to a new location (the old Daiso location, right by the food court) and it looks a lot better - real shelves, no more wire racks.  But the selection remains the second rate toys that I don't think they typically carry in Toys R Us stores.  Service was really great.  My mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it.  Actually, the wings don't even really fit into the slot they're supposed to go in.  So I brought it back open boxed and didn't have a receipt.  The manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle.  It helps that they're still carrying it right on the shelves right now.

Ran across this Toys R Us inside the Great Mall a few weeks ago.  I went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what I found.  The store looks horrible to start with.  Lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys.  Most of the toys I saw had damaged boxes.  I did a spot check of the prices for a few items (Legos, video games, toy cars) against the Toys R Us website.  This store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but 10-30% compared to what they sell for at a normal Toys R Us.  Unless you're looking for something that you absolutely can't find anywhere else stay away from here.  You'll get ripped off.

Thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted, as I travel between Toys r us to look for exclusive items. ( TF:A Arcee, old sets of exclusive star wars figures, etc ). I go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties, but who am I for you to listen to? Did i mention I live in milpitas, which is like 40 minutes away?This place has cheaper items, if you know what you're looking for. ( heres an actual comparison of two items that i found, star wars: Transformers at regular TRU, 12.99, at the express, 9.99. General grevious ) At the time i was buying them, regular Toys r Us stores had gotten rid of its old General transformers, and I was only able to find it at express. Oh, and by the way, sir, if you haven't noticed, LOTS OF WEBSITES THAT SELL THINGS ONLINE WILL BE CHEAPER. WHY? BECAUSE YOU PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING.Holy crap, that dude had a vendetta against TRU, and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod.

This is not a real TRU.  This is like a TRU Express or something, can't remember what the associates called it.  Inventory here is hit and miss.  Its kinda like shopping for toys at Costco.  You don't know what they will have, and you can't depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy.  They have what they have.  This is primarily why I'm only giving them 2 stars.  However I have found rare figures here that I had trouble finding elsewhere.  So it is worth a visit every now and then.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
