Testimonials


I have been a patient for ten years. Love Dr. Bley, he is a fantastic care giver and dentist. The office staff and hygienists are fantastic too. I Highly recommend them
Jeremiah M

Gia, the hygienist, was wonderful. Very sweet and gentle with my sensitive teeth.
Megan J - Customer since 2009

Excellent experience! Dr Bley is a very nice man and a great dentist! I trust him completely with my care and he is ethical by not trying to replace old fillings that are still fine! My Dad is a retired dentist and has always told me to look for a dentist with integrity! Dr Bley is that kind of dentist!
Eva B - Customer since 2015

As usual, my recent visit to have a tooth crowned was handled professionally with a high level of competence combined with a great personal manner.
Neil P - Customer since 2013

As usual I had a great experience at Dr. Bley's office. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, check-in is prompt without delay and the visit was as pleasant as a visit at the dentist can be. Thank you!
Kerstin Z - Customer since 2010

Fabulous - the whole office is just a joy to deal with..from a simple cleaning to needing a crown. First Class Dentist with First Class service !!!
Donna F - Customer since 2001

Everyone at Dr. Bley's dental practice is always courteous, friendly, and professional. They always make you feel comfortable; they take time to explain procedures. I've been going there for many years and I am more than satisfied with their service.
