Invesco PowerShares (formerly PowerShares Capital Management) is a boutique investment management firm based near Chicago which manages a family of exchange-traded funds or ETFs.[1][2] The company has been part of Invesco, which markets the PowerShares product, since 2006.
Created in 2002, PowerShares funds use quantitative indices as a benchmark.[3] There are currently over 120 PowerShares ETFs.[4]
PowerShares cover and emulate a variety of market indices; for example, the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ) is designed to replicate the NASDAQ-100 Index. The PowerShares QQQ is one of the most widely traded shares on the stock market, according to writer John J. Murphy.[5][4]
PowerShares ETFs also cover the commodities market, diversified and tiny or microcap stocks.[6] For instance, the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund, or DBC, which it developed with Deutsche Bank, allows for individual investors to invest in commodities by means of its ETF.[7] The PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) deals with the crude oil index.[6]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2002 as PowerShares Capital Management.
In 2006 PowerShares Capital Management was acquired by Invesco so that Invesco could get access to the ETF business and the company was renamed Invesco PowerShares.
In 2006, PowerShares offered an exchange traded fund in the private equity market in a "diversified fashion", although a report in BusinessWeek suggested that analysts thought that the fund was "something people can live without."[8]
In 2005, PowerShares developed a fund to allow customers to invest in "tiny companies" or microcaps; according to a report in the New York Times, the Powershares Zacks Micro Cap Portfolio owns 330 stocks which follow the index of Zacks Investment Research, and the PowerShares ETF re-evaluates these tiny companies weekly, removing those which "do not pass muster".[2] In addition, the microcap ETF rebalances the entire index each quarter, according to the report.[2]
In 2010, the firm was involved in a trademark infringement dispute with Select Sector SPDR Trust over whether trading symbols, or tickers, could be considered as brand names.[9]
In 2013 the William F. Sharpe Award for ETF Product of the Year went to the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio ETF NYSE: BKLN.[10][11]

PowerShares DB Energy: Too Late to Join the Party? | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PowerShares DB Energy: Too Late to Join the Party?Jun. 19, 2008  3:13 PM ET|| Includes: DBC, DBE, DBO, USOby: Don DionDon Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO Insights It should come as no surprise to anyone who has to buy gasoline, heating oil, natural gas or any other petroleum product—PowerShares DB Energy Fund (NYSEARCA:DBE), which began trading on Jan. 5, 2007, has had a spectacular run as the ETF approaches its 18-month anniversary.  The fund’s NAV return since inception is 115.2%, including a 49% year-to-date gain (through June 13) and a 27.6% jump in the last three months, all better than 89% of energy ETFs.   DBE invests directly in futures contracts, exchange-traded instruments promising the delivery of oil at a pre-determined price on a future date. Essentially, the fund bets on the price of five energy commodities—Brent crude oil, heating oil, light crude, natural gas, and RBOB (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending) gasoline.  The fund generates returns from fluctuations in the price of the commodities; from interest on Treasury bills used to collateralize the futures contracts; and from rolling contract yields, thanks to the PowerShares DB Optimum Yield model.  Prices for four of the five have been rising for several years and hovering at or near record highs for several months, the key reason for DBE’s sparkling returns. The fifth, natural gas, is also up sharply in recent months.  On Monday, for example, Brent crude was 89% more expensive than it was a year ago, while RBOB gas was 49% higher. Spot prices for Henry Hub natural gas—which make up just 10% of the fund’s base weighting, compared to an equal 22.5% stake in each of the other four—were up 64% over the last year, to $12.49 per million British thermal units.  The fund’s daily index weightings vary due to fluctuations in price, and the index is rebalanced to the base weights annually during the first week or so of November. 
 While the mix makes DBE more diversified than PowerShares DB Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:DBO) or the popular United States Oil Fund (NYSEARCA:USO)—which has taken in nearly $1 billion versus $168 million for DBE and $85 million for DBO—this fund is clearly not a diversified fund.  In fact, DBE is not part of our PowerShares Momentum Tracker Portfolio because we gain exposure to oil through the DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (NYSEARCA:DBC), which also tracks aluminum, corn, gold and wheat.  DBE has out-gained DBC since we added the latter to the portfolio (Nov. 1), 52.1% to 42.8%. But can that continue? Commodity investing is always risky. And the long, seemingly merciless run-up in prices for the energy commodities that make up 90% of this fund’s assets only magnify that risk.  Last fall, Cleve Rueckert of TickerSense noted that we were in the 22nd oil-price rally (20% or more) in two decades. After each, prices declined by an average of 32% over an average period of four months. Such a drop would likely be devastating for shareholders of DBE and a host of other commodity and energy funds.  In Monday’s commodities round-up, the Wall Street Journal noted, “After rising 40% this year, some observers wonder how much higher crude prices can go before prices cripple consumption.”  Of course, this rally may be different. For one thing, as Rueckert pointed out, the average rally lasted 226 days, and this one is closer to 500 days now, since oil closed at $50.48 in January 2007.  The U.S. slowdown, the weak U.S. dollar, interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, and an influx of money into speculative energy and commodity investing, along with a constant in the space—geopolitical issues—have all helped lift prices to the stratosphere.  Crude futures hit another intraday record on Monday, nearing $140 per barrel, before falling back on news of Saudi Arabia’s announcement that it will boost output. On Monday alone, prices gained and then fell nearly 4% before closing down just 0.2%. Analysts are predicting anything from a 30% drop in oil prices to another big jump: Matthew Simmons, president of Houston investment bank Simmons & Co. International, predicts oil will hit $200 to $500 per barrel over the next six months to five years, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. 
 The bottom line: No one knows what’ll happen next, though more and more experts are saying that $150-$200 oil is realistic over the next six to 12 months. While that would be good news for DBE shareholders, it may come with potentially violent swings, both up and down.  The news from Saudi Arabia caused DBE’s NAV to drop 3.25% intraday on Monday (after opening 2.74% higher than Friday’s close).  That’s a lot of movement, even for investors with commodity funds as a niche play, designed to diversify a portfolio. For most, that’s the only role this fund should play, especially right now: DBE may offer some protection in today’s stormy seas as a hedge against inflation and other market troubles, but its outsized returns raise the question of whether it’s too late to get on board.

Invesco PowerShares (formerly PowerShares Capital Management) is a boutique investment management firm based near Chicago which manages a family of exchange-traded funds or ETFs.[1][2] The company has been part of Invesco, which markets the PowerShares product, since 2006.
Created in 2002, PowerShares funds use quantitative indices as a benchmark.[3] There are currently over 120 PowerShares ETFs.[4]
PowerShares cover and emulate a variety of market indices; for example, the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ) is designed to replicate the NASDAQ-100 Index. The PowerShares QQQ is one of the most widely traded shares on the stock market, according to writer John J. Murphy.[5][4]
PowerShares ETFs also cover the commodities market, diversified and tiny or microcap stocks.[6] For instance, the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund, or DBC, which it developed with Deutsche Bank, allows for individual investors to invest in commodities by means of its ETF.[7] The PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) deals with the crude oil index.[6]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2002 as PowerShares Capital Management.
In 2006 PowerShares Capital Management was acquired by Invesco so that Invesco could get access to the ETF business and the company was renamed Invesco PowerShares.
In 2006, PowerShares offered an exchange traded fund in the private equity market in a "diversified fashion", although a report in BusinessWeek suggested that analysts thought that the fund was "something people can live without."[8]
In 2005, PowerShares developed a fund to allow customers to invest in "tiny companies" or microcaps; according to a report in the New York Times, the Powershares Zacks Micro Cap Portfolio owns 330 stocks which follow the index of Zacks Investment Research, and the PowerShares ETF re-evaluates these tiny companies weekly, removing those which "do not pass muster".[2] In addition, the microcap ETF rebalances the entire index each quarter, according to the report.[2]
In 2010, the firm was involved in a trademark infringement dispute with Select Sector SPDR Trust over whether trading symbols, or tickers, could be considered as brand names.[9]
In 2013 the William F. Sharpe Award for ETF Product of the Year went to the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio ETF NYSE: BKLN.[10][11]

Invesco PowerShares (formerly PowerShares Capital Management) is a boutique investment management firm based near Chicago which manages a family of exchange-traded funds or ETFs.[1][2] The company has been part of Invesco, which markets the PowerShares product, since 2006.
Created in 2002, PowerShares funds use quantitative indices as a benchmark.[3] There are currently over 120 PowerShares ETFs.[4]
PowerShares cover and emulate a variety of market indices; for example, the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ) is designed to replicate the NASDAQ-100 Index. The PowerShares QQQ is one of the most widely traded shares on the stock market, according to writer John J. Murphy.[5][4]
PowerShares ETFs also cover the commodities market, diversified and tiny or microcap stocks.[6] For instance, the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund, or DBC, which it developed with Deutsche Bank, allows for individual investors to invest in commodities by means of its ETF.[7] The PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) deals with the crude oil index.[6]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 2002 as PowerShares Capital Management.
In 2006 PowerShares Capital Management was acquired by Invesco so that Invesco could get access to the ETF business and the company was renamed Invesco PowerShares.
In 2006, PowerShares offered an exchange traded fund in the private equity market in a "diversified fashion", although a report in BusinessWeek suggested that analysts thought that the fund was "something people can live without."[8]
In 2005, PowerShares developed a fund to allow customers to invest in "tiny companies" or microcaps; according to a report in the New York Times, the Powershares Zacks Micro Cap Portfolio owns 330 stocks which follow the index of Zacks Investment Research, and the PowerShares ETF re-evaluates these tiny companies weekly, removing those which "do not pass muster".[2] In addition, the microcap ETF rebalances the entire index each quarter, according to the report.[2]
In 2010, the firm was involved in a trademark infringement dispute with Select Sector SPDR Trust over whether trading symbols, or tickers, could be considered as brand names.[9]
In 2013 the William F. Sharpe Award for ETF Product of the Year went to the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio ETF NYSE: BKLN.[10][11]

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
