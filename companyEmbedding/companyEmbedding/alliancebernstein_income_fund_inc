History[edit]
Origins[edit]
AB traces its origins back to the founding of Sanford C. Bernstein in 1967 as an investment-management firm for private clients. Sanford C. Bernstein & Company was originally co-founded by Zalman Bernstein, Paul P. Bernstein, Shepard D. Osherow, Roger Hertog and Lewis Sanders.[3]
Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment-management department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc., merged with the investment-advisory business of Moody's Investor Services, Inc.
2000–2015[edit]
In October 2000, Alliance Capital acquired Sanford C. Bernstein.[4] Alliance Capital's growth equity and corporate fixed-income investing, and its family of retail mutual funds, accompanied Bernstein's value equity and tax-exempt fixed-income management, and its private-client business.
It had about US$800 billion assets under management as of the end of 2007.[5]
2015 onwards[edit]
On January 20, 2015, AllianceBernstein announced a new brand name, "AB" and logo.[6]

The retail part of AB provides financial professionals and individual investors with the investment solutions, research, insights and tools that cover mutual funds, Managed Accounts, College Saving, Retirement Saving, and Insurance Services.[8]
Sell-side Research[edit]
Sell-side research and brokerage services are provided by wholly owned subsidiary Sanford C. Bernstein. It is also well known as Bernstein Research.[9]
Private Wealth Management[edit]
Bernstein Wealth Management, part of AB, provides investment and wealth-planning services for high-net-worth clients in the Americas[10]
529 Savings Plan[edit]
Rhode Island’s 529 savings plan, CollegeBoundfund®, was managed by AB and featured AB mutual funds until 2016.[11] It is now administered by Ascensus College Savings.[12]
Headquarters and locations[edit]

NEW YORK, April 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AllianceBernstein Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") (NYSE:   ACG), today announced on this date, April 14, 2016, a final distribution of $0.01784 per share of Common Stock, payable on April 19, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2016. This final distribution will be paid entirely in cash, with no option for dividend reinvestment. The distribution represents an amount necessary or appropriate to maintain the Fund's qualification as a "regulated investment company" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.








As previously announced, the Fund's stockholders approved the acquisition of the assets and the assumption of the liabilities of the Fund by AB Income Fund (the "Acquiring Fund"), a series of AB Bond Fund, Inc. and an open-end investment company (the "Acquisition").The Acquisition is scheduled to close on April 22, 2016 (the "Closing Date"). On the Closing Date, each shareholder of the Fund will receive Advisor Class shares of the Acquiring Fund with an aggregate net asset value equal to the aggregate net asset value of the Fund shares held by the shareholder as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the day before the Closing Date.
The Fund's shares will cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") after the close of trading on April 18, 2016. After that time, holders of the Fund's shares will not be able to sell their shares on the NYSE and their investment will be temporarily illiquid. Effective April 25, 2016, the first business day following the Acquisition, holders of Advisor Class shares of the Acquiring Fund received in the Acquisition may redeem their shares at net asset value, subject to a 0.75% redemption fee for the first three months after the date of the Acquisition.
AllianceBernstein Income Fund, Inc. is managed by AllianceBernstein L.P.
