	Re:


	Transocean Partners LLC Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as U.S. counsel for Transocean Partners LLC (the Company), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, with respect
	to certain legal matters in connection with the offer and sale by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited of common units representing limited liability company interests in the Company. We have also participated in the preparation of a Prospectus (the
	Prospectus) forming part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-196958 (the Registration Statement).


	This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions, and is conditioned upon certain representations made by the Company as to factual
	matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate). In addition, this opinion is based upon the factual representations of the Company concerning its business, properties, and governing documents
	as set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In our capacity as counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations
	and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records, and other instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this
	opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents, and the conformity to authentic
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. For the purpose of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
	addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.


	We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, foreign laws, the laws of any state or any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any
	state. We hereby confirm that all statements of legal conclusions contained in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations constitute the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. with respect
	to the matters set forth therein as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth therein. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed therein.


	This opinion is rendered to you as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion
	subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder, and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which
	are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the representations described above, including in the Registration Statement and the Officers Certificate, may
	affect the conclusions stated herein.

	forth in the Registration Statement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm, or other entity, for any purpose, without our prior written
	consent. However, this opinion may be relied upon by you and by persons entitled to rely on it pursuant to applicable provisions of federal securities law, including persons purchasing common units pursuant to the Registration Statement.


	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Prospectus and to the use of our name under the captions Material
	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Legal Matters in the Registration Statement. We further consent to the incorporation by reference of this letter and consent into any registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b)
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), with respect to the common units. By giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the

	), certain property
	of Seller, including the property described on

	Schedule A

	attached hereto (collectively, the 

	).


	WHEREAS,
	Seller desires to sell, convey, assign, transfer, set over and deliver the Assets to Purchaser in exchange for US$[], subject to adjustment pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 4 below (such adjusted amount herein referred to as the 

	Asset

	NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the agreements contained in this Agreement and
	other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties hereto acknowledge, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


	1. Seller hereby sells, conveys, assigns, transfers, sets over and delivers the Assets unto Purchaser in exchange for the Asset Purchase Price,
	which Seller acknowledges receipt of that certain Promissory Note, dated as of July [], 2014, with Transocean Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company (

	Omnibus Agreement

	), and paragraph 3 of this Agreement, Seller indemnifies, defends and holds harmless Purchaser from and against: (a) any Covered Environmental Losses (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement)
	relating to the Assets to the extent that Seller is notified by Purchaser of any such Covered Environmental Losses within





	five years after the Closing Date (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement); (b) Liabilities (as defined in the Omnibus Agreement) to Purchaser arising from (i) the failure of Purchaser, or
	Purchasers transferees, immediately after the Closing Date, to be the owner of such valid leasehold interests or fee ownership interests in and to the Assets as are necessary to enable Purchaser, or Purchasers transferees, to own and
	operate the Assets in substantially the same manner that the Assets were owned and/or operated by Seller, or Sellers transferors, immediately prior to the date hereof, (ii) without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this
	Agreement, the Contribution Agreement or the Omnibus Agreement, any judicial determination substantially to the effect that Seller did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange therefor or was rendered insolvent by reason of the sale,
	conveyance, assignment, transfer, setting over and delivery or (iii) the failure of Purchaser, or Purchasers transferees, to have by the Closing Date any consent or governmental permit necessary to allow Purchaser, or Purchasers
	transferees, to own or operate the Assets in substantially the same manner that the Assets were owned and/or operated by Seller, or Sellers transferors, immediately prior to the date thereof, in each of

	clauses (b)(i)

	and

	(b)(iii)

	above, to the extent that Seller is notified by Purchaser of such Liabilities within three years after the Closing Date; and (c) (i) any documentary, filing, recording, transfer, deed and conveyance Taxes (as defined in the
	Omnibus Agreement) that may be due with respect to the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Assets hereunder and (ii) all Tax liabilities attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets prior to 11:59 p.m. on the
	date immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, including any such Tax liabilities of the Seller, or Sellers transferors, that may result from the consummation of the formation transactions for Purchaser to the extent that Seller is
	notified by Purchaser of any such Tax liabilities within the applicable statute of limitations plus 60 days, but excluding any Taxes reserved on the books of Purchaser on the Closing Date. Any indemnification pursuant to this paragraph 2 shall be
	treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.


	3. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this Agreement, the aggregate
	liability under (i) clause (a) of paragraph 2 of this Agreement, (ii) similar indemnity provisions contained in all other Assignments and Bills of Sale executed in connection with the Contribution Agreement and (iii) the
	indemnity contained in

	Section 7.1

	of the Omnibus Agreement, shall not exceed the limitations contained in

	Section 7.3

	of the Omnibus Agreement.


	4. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth its calculation of Actual Net
	Working Capital and its calculation of the Post-Closing Adjustment, if any. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, within 10 days after its delivery of such statement, an amount equal to the Post-Closing
	Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, within 10 days of its receipt of such statement, an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Adjustment. As used herein, the term
	

	Actual Net Working Capital

	 means the amount of net working capital of Transocean RIGP DIN LLC as of 11:59 p.m. on the date immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, calculated in the same manner as calculated for the
	forecast for Transocean Partners included in its registration statement on Form S-1 filed in connection with its initial public offering. As used herein, the term 

	Post-Closing Adjustment

	 means the amount equal to $[]
	(

	Initial Net Working Capital

	) minus Actual Net Working Capital. Any Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 4 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.

	5. This Agreement shall not be binding until it becomes effective at 11:59 p.m. (Houston, Texas
	local time) on the date hereof.

Transocean Partners LLC launch IPO
Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company formed by Transocean Ltd., announced today that it has commenced an initial public offering of 17,500,000 common units representing limited liability company interests pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). All of the common units are being offered by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean Ltd. The underwriters of the offering are expected to be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 common units from Transocean Partners Holdings Limited. The common units are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RIGP.” The common units being offered represent a 25.4 percent limited liability company interest in Transocean Partners LLC, or a 29.2 percent limited liability company interest if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units. Transocean Ltd., through Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, will own the remaining limited liability company interests in Transocean Partners. Transocean Partners LLC will initially take majority holdings in the ‘Discoverer Inspiration’ and ‘Discoverer Clear Leader’ drillships and the ‘Development Driller III’ semisub units. The newly listed company also has the first right to offer for ownership of the newbuilds, ‘Deepwater Invictus’, ‘Deepwater Thalassa’, Deepwater Proteus’, Deepwater Pontus’, Deepwater Poesidon’ and ‘Deepwater Conqueror’ units, should Transocean Ltd decide to sell the assets.



11 Mar 2010

Discoverer Inspiration Begins Five-Year Contract With Chevron
Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) today announced that the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship Discoverer Inspiration has commenced operations for Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico under a five-year drilling contract. The dynamically positioned double-hulled Discoverer Inspiration includes the most advanced drilling capabilities in the offshore drilling industry. The vessel is an enhanced version of Transocean's three predecessor Enterprise-class drillships, which have set deepwater drilling records in recent years, including the world water-depth drilling record of 10,011 feet set by the Discoverer Deep Seas while working for Chevron in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
