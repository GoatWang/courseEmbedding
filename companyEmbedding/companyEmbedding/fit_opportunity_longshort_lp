I like wearing denim jeans but at times, find them too stiff and restrictive. Denim has also almost become a de facto uniform. Just look around at the mall and it's nothing but a sea of blue denim; yuk, no imagination. Wrancher's come in a bunch of colors that I like and they never fade (BTW Wrangler, more colors is always better and how '__bout a few patterns too!). Ever look at faded black jeans, just nasty. My black Wrancher's are the same color as when I bought them. I think the pressed crease is sweet too!For younger guys like me, buy them a little shorter than your normal size and the crease will stay straight. They fit nice and slim , the way jeans are meant to fit. Wear them with fun shoes like skaters or Cons along with a retro snug fitting shirt and you'll look ace!Dudes, you gotta try these jeans.VSMost Liked Negative Review Sizing is the issue if ordering on lineI was looking for dresser pants to wear with my boots.

I ordered these like I order my jeans and found the waist, seat and thighs much smaller then the jeans. Had to send them back and ordered a waist size two sizes bigger then I normally wear. The return policy was excellent and I had no problems making an exchange.Reviewed by 242 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-10Back to topPrevious | Next »7/21/2017 5.0Wrangler dress slacks By No nicknamefrom San FranciscoAbout Me Free spirited, I like to do my research before purchasingProsComfortableDurableGood qualityGood stretchStylishTrue to sizeValue for moneyConsBest UsesComments about wrangler Wrancher® Dress Jean:Very nice comfortable fitFit:PerfectQuality:GoodValue:GoodBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/17/2017 5.0what a recvieir By 0from santa rosaComments about wrangler Wrancher® Dress Jean:grteatQuality:AverageValue:AverageBottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/11/2017(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Best slacks I've ever owned By Joefrom Rochester, mnAbout Me Adventurous, Casual, Classic, Conservative, Creative, Free spirited, I like to do my research before purchasing, StylishProsClassic / Won't dateComfortableDurableGood fit / flatteringGood qualityGood stretchStylishValue for moneyConsBest UsesComments about wrangler Wrancher® Dress Jean:These slacks have just the right material weight and fit very well.

It shows you guys are customer focused. But, I don't see the skinny option for the dress jeans style!Asked on 6/30/2014 by johnroadKnow the answer?
