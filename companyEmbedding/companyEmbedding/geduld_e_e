History[edit]
Founding and early history[edit]
The firm of Parmer, Herzog & Chadwick was established by Robert I. Herzog in 1926 as a bond trading and brokerage company. The company suffered severe losses in the stock market crash of 1929 but stayed in business by trading in foreign bonds. Over the years, the firm evolved into Herzog Heine Geduld Inc., becoming a member of the New York Stock Exchange.[1]
Acquisition by Merrill Lynch[edit]
By 2000, the Nasdaq market, fueled by the Tech Bubble was booming and Herzog was the third largest market maker, with an eight percent market share.[2]
After buying Herzog, Merrill increased its Nasdaq market-making from 650 stocks to 10,000, many of them not popular enough to be listed on the main Nasdaq market. It began trading thousands of smaller companies on Nasdaq's OTC Bulletin Board or via the Pink Sheets.[3]

Published on Feb 6, 2015OneWire (http://www.onewire.com/videos) interviews Buzzy Geduld, CEO of Cougar Capital, in the latest installment to the Open Door video series with Skiddy von Stade. "Donuts taught me how to run a business. Running a donut shop is no different than running a brokerage firm. You’ve got clients, they want service, they want a good product."Born and raised in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, E.E. “Buzzy” Geduld began his career on Wall Street as a quote boy on the trading floor in 1961. Eight months later, he took a reprieve from finance and went into the donut business with his brother. Together, they built eight doughnut shops, eventually selling all but one, The Donut Pub, which is still in operation today. In 1968, he returned to Wall Street to work for the leading market maker Herzog & Heine, becoming partner shortly thereafter. By the time Merrill Lynch acquired the firm for $920 million in 2000, Herzog Heine Geduld was the third largest U.S. firm linking buyers and sellers on the NASDAQ. Buzzy founded his family office, Cougar Capital, in 2009 and still actively manages The Donut Pub, which has consistently named as one of the best donut shops in NYC.OneWireNew York, New Yorkhttp://www.onewire.com

Buzzy Geduld, CEO – Cougar Capital
“Donuts taught me how to run a business. Running a donut shop is no different than running a brokerage firm. You’ve got clients, they want service, they want a good product.”
It can be difficult to find a career you’re passionate about, and even harder to become successful at it. E.E. “Buzzy” Geduld not only did this once, but twice, selling his brokerage firm to Merrill Lynch for $920 million and building one of NYC’s most popular donut shops, The Donut Pub. For him, if you’re passionate about something, it’s not about where you end up, but the journey.
“I’ve been fortunate. I had a passion for donuts, I had a passion for finance. If you find something you’re really passionate about…it will never feel like work.”

Abstract
Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) is an optical measurement principle to localize and measure the distance of objects in space. Basically it is similar to a RADAR-system, but instead of using microwaves LIDAR uses ultraviolett, infrared or beams within the visible light spectrum. Besides distance measurements, which is the basic task, LIDAR sensors can be used for a limited visual detection of objects by analyzing the light intensity, visibility measurement by analyzing the shape of the reflected LIDAR pulse, day/night detection as background illumination is significantly different between day and night, pollution detection and speed estimation. As several research vehicles for autonomous driving vehicles like e.g. Google car use LIDAR as basis sensor technology for scanning the environment there is an increase in development activities for LIDAR sensors meeting automotive requirements (cost, performance, reliability).
Parking Assistance are systems which support the driver during parking manoeuver. This is achieved either by providing distance information to relevant obstacles, camera images or additionally by steering assistance. For the different system configurations requirements regarding sensors, signal processing, HMI, interfaces to the vehicle network need to be met. While first parking systems only provided informations to the driver, recent systems provide lateral steering support and current plus next gerneration parking systems will take more and more both lateral and longitudinal controll of the vehicle during the parking manoeuver. In the near future Valet Parking systems will be available, where the system searches for a suitable parking slot and performs the entire parking process automatically.

                    Buzzy Geduld, CEO - Cougar Capital

Donuts taught me how to run a business. Running a donut shop is no different than running a brokerage firm. You’ve got clients, they want service, they want a good product.

Bio:

                    Born and raised in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, E.E. “Buzzy” Geduld began his career on Wall Street as a quote boy on the trading floor in 1961. Eight months later, he took a reprieve from finance and went into the donut business with his brother. Together, they built eight doughnut shops, eventually selling all but one, The Donut Pub, which is still in operation today. In 1968, he returned to Wall Street to work for the leading market maker Herzog & Heine, becoming partner shortly thereafter. By the time Merrill Lynch acquired the firm for $920 million in 2000, Herzog Heine Geduld was the third largest U.S. firm linking buyers and sellers on the NASDAQ. Buzzy founded his family office, Cougar Capital, in 2009 and still actively manages The Donut Pub, which has consistently named as one of the best donut shops in NYC.
