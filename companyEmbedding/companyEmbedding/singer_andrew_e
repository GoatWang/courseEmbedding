High-Tech Meal Delivery

Singer recently helped Reading Hospital take its meal delivery service to a whole new level. Instead of having the staff run back and forth to the kitchen, robots are now doing much of the transport. They carry trays of food from the kitchen to the nutrition staff over two blocks away. The robots ride the elevator alone and navigate through the hallways on pre-programmed routes without bumping in to anyone. Singer supplied the carts that the robots ride on, traveling 18 miles a day.
Watch them in action on wfmz.com by clicking  HERE. 



A Great Job at Doing Good

Singer salesperson, Cliff Baker, saw a need in his community after Hurricane Sandy and set out to fill it. He and Mike Jurusz of Chef Mike’s ABG in Seaside Park, NJ, started an organization to provide Thanksgiving meals to those in need and those who came to help the community rebuild.  From 350 meals that first Thanksgiving, the organization has grown to feeding 1500 Thanksgiving and Christmas meals in 2016. If There is a Need, We Will Feed includes 50 volunteers, 75 drivers and numerous restaurants and organizations which donate food and distribute the meals. A Toys for Tots component was added for this year’s Christmas donation.
More info on this organization and the companies which support it can be found HERE. 



Thanksgiving Food Drive

Singer employees recently participated in an annual food drive to support families in need. Working with The Salvation Army of Reading, they donated over 600 non-perishable items including green beans, corn, cranberry sauce, stuffing and much more. Thanks to their generosity, 450-500 individuals will have a happy Thanksgiving this year!

The Consul-General expressed France’s deepest gratitude to the men and women who helped free their country from German occupation during WWII.Henry was very proud to receive this prestigious award. He accepted it on behalf of all American veterans who fought in France, most of whom have passed on or are in poor health. Joining Henry at the ceremony were his wife Helene, children Fred, Andrew, and Julie, and Julie’s husband, Phil Scanlan, who recently served as Australia’s Consul-General in New York.

Thanks to all who took time from their busy schedules to attend. 





New at the Whitney Museum

In 2015, the Whitney Museum of American Art moved from uptown Manhattan to the hip Meatpacking District. As part of the $400 million project, Singer’s New York division supplied and installed the first-floor restaurant, working with Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group and Chef Michael Anthony, formerly of Gramercy Tavern.






International Restaurant Show in New York

Singer had a large exhibit at the recent International Restaurant & Foodservice Show through our New York division, M Tucker. Held at the Javits Center in New York, the show draws customers from throughout the Northeast and is the largest foodservice industry show on the east coast. Our 3200-square-foot display showcased new foodservice equipment, supplies and tabletop items. Thanks to all who visited our booth.Come see us there next year… the show will run March 5th to 7th, 2017.




Philadelphia Hotel Transformation 

Singer’s Mt Laurel contract design office participated in the complete renovation of Philadelphia’s old Four Seasons Hotel, transforming it into a hip, urban getaway, The Logan. Our team supplied and installed foodservice equipment in the kitchen and dishroom, also providing start-up and training.  Additionally, they supplied bar equipment and liquor systems for several bars throughout the hotel, including the rooftop bar which offers 360° views of center city. They worked under severe time constraints to successfully complete this large, high-profile job. 





Time To Invest In Equipment: Congress Gives Small Businesses A Permanent Tax Break 
01/06/2016

At year’s end, the foodservice equipment industry and its customers received a gift that keeps on giving. After years of late-minute uncertainty on whether Congress would renew the deal that many business owners rely on to finance their big-ticket purchases, Washington got its act together in December and passed a mammoth tax bill providing small businesses a permanent tax break on buying equipment.The much-anticipated Section 179 deduction locks in a large tax break for small-business capital investments  that has been temporary until now. In addition, a bonus 50% deduction has been locked in through 2019, businesses of all sizes to depreciate half the cost of equipment acquired and put in service during 2015, 2016 and 2017.The provision makes it more affordable for small companies to buy up to $500,000 a year worth of equipment, ranging from computers to vehicles to reach-in refrigeration and ranges. The purchases can be written off immediately on a business’ taxes instead of being depreciated over a number of years. While most equipment that small businesses lease, finance or purchase will qualify for the Section 179 Deduction, there are some exceptions, such as air conditioning or heating equipment and property used outside the United States. Information on qualifying capital items can be found here.The deduction is essentially limited to small and midsize companies. It begins phasing out when a company spends more than $2 million a year on qualifying purchases, and is eliminated entirely for those that spend more than $2.5 million.Section 179 was once a fairly limited tax break, with an annual cap of $25,000 or less. But starting in 2003, Congress began a series of temporary increases, each requiring annual reauthorization to prevent the cap from returning to $25,000. From now on, operators and small business owners can plan ahead. The 233-page tax deal, signed by President Obama, permanently sets the Section 179 cap at $500,000, subject to inflation adjustments.
 

COSME Named #1 New Restaurant in NYC
  
    Congratulations to Cosme on being named the 2015 #1 new restaurant in New York by the New York Times!   Singer is proud to have participated in this project through its New York division. The M Tucker team of Joe Steckmeister and Dennis DeCicco worked closely with Chef Enrique Olvera and Chef de Cuisine Daniela Soto-Innes to assist with the kitchen design, equipment procurement and installation of the kitchen equipment.  The team of Morgan Tucker and Silena Mejia helped design and provide the tabletop and also procured the kitchen supplies for the new restaurant.  We are thrilled for Cosme’s success and recognition!





    Morgan Tucker, of Singer’s New York division, has been named Chairperson of the New York City Branch of the American Institute of Wine and Food for 2016. The organization provides its members with modern and relevant educational and social content relating to food and wine. Congratulations, Morgan, on this position!






    The first joint sales meeting of Singer and Singer NY was held in October at the company’s Bellmawr, NJ location. Singer is focused on unifying both divisions under one platform. Together, we have 46 territory sales consultants and a fleet of 45 trucks providing daily deliveries from Connecticut to Maryland.






    M Tucker was featured on the CNBC program, Consumed: The Real Restaurant Business,  Season 1, Episode 107 which aired on 6/24/15. The show follows the ups and downs of three different restaurants in New York. Tucker’s Joe Steckmeister and Marc Fuchs were shown in a segment about The Meatball Shop, discussing the moving of kitchen equipment. After working with Tucker, The Meatball Shop’s owner, Daniel Holzman, said "M Tucker is ... one of the best in the business."    



   If you just want to watch the Tucker segment of this episode, fast forward to 26:26 on the video. Congrats to Marc and Joe on a job well done.



A Fond Farewell
  
    On May 28th, Tucker employees gathered at an after-work reception to honor Stephen Tucker. Stephen retired after 40+ years of service to pursue new business opportunities. Many co-workers thanked Stephen for the influence he’s had on their lives and careers. Family members and friends from the industry were also on hand.  Stephen’s energy, enthusiasm and humor were contagious. We will all miss him. As he embarks on his new endeavors, we wish him the very best.

United Way Awards
  
    Singer recently received three awards from the United Way of Berks County for its 2014 campaign. For the second time in three years, Singer was awarded Outstanding Employee Campaign for companies with 101-499 employees. This award is presented to organizations that best exemplify the spirit of voluntary giving and that have put forth the best effort in organizing employee campaigns to increase giving. We also earned an honorable mention in the Presidential Recognition Award based on the overall total of our donation. And for the first time ever, we reached the highest level of achievement for our individual giving. The Presidential Award is given to employee groups with a per capita donation of $250 or more. Singer is proud of all its employees and the many ways they give back to the community.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection1. Dr. Andrea Jacobs Singer, MD3800 Reservoir Rd NWWashington, DC 20007(202) 444-8531No Internet Heading AssignedWebsiteBusinesses in related categories to MusiciansAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Gene Donati Presentations Inc12405 Saint James RdRockville, MD 20850(301) 294-1600MusiciansAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Bialek's Music932 Hungerford Dr Ste 3bRockville, MD 20850(301) 340-6206MusiciansWedding Supplies & ServicesWebsiteFrom Business: Owner Ray Bialek started Bialek's Music LTD in 1978 ( at the age of 24 ) after gaining six years of experience with other agencies.
