HOLLAND -- Another regulatory filing by companies controlled by David and Steve Van Andel scales back the amount of Macatawa Bank Corp. the Amway heirs may end up owning.
A notice posted by the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago   that summarizes filings made for the week ending Nov. 14 says White Bay Capital LLLP, the Stephen Van Andel 2009 WBC Trust and Stephen Van Andel plan to acquire 33.9 percent of the voting shares of troubled Holland-based Macatawa.
A nearly identical filing from the previous week said the same group planned to acquire 100 percent of the voting shares of Macatawa.
A woman who answered the phone at Van Andel Enterprises, which includes White Bay, said "Thank you for your call, but at this time we have no comment." Bank officials have not responded to Press inquiries.
In a statement issued after The Press broke the news about the initial filing earlier this month Amway Chairman Steve Van Andel said: "This is a required filing based on the amount of our current investment in preferred shares and today's stock price," he said.
"We have made no decisions about whether to increase our stake in Macatawa Bank at this time."
David Van Andel, the managing partner at White Bay Capital LLC, last year  acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Macatawa for $20 million. That deal capped White Bay LLC's ownership of the bank at 9.9 percent.
David Van Andel, who is chairman and CEO of the Van Andel Institute and nutrition products company IdeaSphere Inc., has not responded to Press inquiries regarding Macatawa.
In October, the bank said its rating had been dropped from well capitalized to adequately capitalized because its total regulatory capital dropped $11.3 million below the well-capitalized threshold. The rating is issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which regulates banks.
Macatawa reported a $20.9 million loss for the third quarter and took the unusual step of forgoing a conference call with analysts and releasing results after the stock market closed.
The next week the bank appointed Grand Rapids telecommunications executive Richard Postma as its new chairman.

HOLLAND, MI - Two insiders at Macatawa Bank Corp. reported they have added to their holdings of the Holland bank holding company's shares in the past week.
White Bay Capital LLP, an investment group owned by the family of Amway Corp. co-founder Jay Van Andel, reported buying 80,796 shares on Friday, Feb. 6, at an average price of $5.17 per share, a total value of $417,715.32, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Based in Grand Rapids, White Bay now owns 5.3 million shares, or about 15.6 percent of Macatawa's stock, valued at about $28.3 million. 
White Bay is represented on Macatawa's board of directors by Mark Bugge, its chief financial officer. Bugge also owns 10,652 shares individually.
In 2008, White Bay purchased $26.2 million worth of newly issued preferred stock from Macatawa to raise capital that was needed to keep the bank afloat during a weakening in the West Michigan housing market. Macatawa redeemed those shares in early 2014.
Macatawa's stock was trading at $5.35 per share on Thursday, Feb. 12. Macatawa's shares have traded between $4.66 and $5.79 in the past 52 weeks.
In a separate transaction, Macatawa board chairman Richard Postma reported buying 33,177 shares of the stock on Thursday, Feb. 5th. The shares were purchased at an average price of $5.48 per share for total transaction of $181,809.96, according to the SEC filing.
Postma now owns 1.6 million shares, or about 4.75 percent, valued at about $8.6 million. He was appointed to Macatawa's board in 2009.
Macatawa has been on a roll in recent quarters as it continues to clean up its balance sheet. Bank officials said last month their past due loans had fallen to the lowest level in the company's history by the end of 2014.
