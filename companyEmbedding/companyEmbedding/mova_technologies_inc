 MOVA Globes

		MOVA globes are simply some of the most technologically advanced and aesthetically pleasing globes on the market today. Also popularly known as the "MOVA spinning globe," these beauties bring together superior technology with a simple yet stunning design for world globes that are completely unique and one-of-a-kind.
	

		MOVA globes use the power of ambient light in conjunction with a layer of safe fluid in between two of the globe's layers to give the sphere a natural rotation that simulates the very rotation of our Earth. They provide the appearance of magically "floating" and gently moving, adding decorative appeal and a "wow" factor to any coffee table, office desk, or end table. Perhaps most impressively, MOVA's globes require absolutely no power source to operate! Each globe stands on a crystal clear acrylic base that allows the sphere to rotate smoothly and efficiently without batteries or power cords. The technology is as simple as it is innovative - a difficult and winning combination to achieve.
	

		MOVA Globes' unique spheres are smaller than traditional desktop globes, making them an ideal fit for small spaces such as a tight workstation, a bookshelf, or a small table. We offer one of the best selection of MOVA globes available anywhere, with a style, size and color for any decorating aesthetic. Choose from classic blue oceans to sleek black, featuring traditional world geography, a terrestrial view with cloud cover, a beautiful and symbolic version of the Heart Sutra, or even a globe of Jupiter! There's something here for everyone with these innovative pieces of art. Order your MOVA globe today for free shipping on one of your new favorite treasures!

About the MOVA Globes
How the MOVA Globe Works
The world's most advanced globe, the MOVA globe rotates silently and is inspired by the earth itself. It requires no power cords or batteries, only the natural light of your home or office. The three-fingered acrylic base is included with every MOVA globe.The MOVA globe rotates peacefully and silently using only the energy of room light and the force of the earth's magnetic field. This is possible because the MOVA globe is actually an inner globe that rotates and is contained within an outer shell made of very clear acrylic that does not rotate. The thin space between the inner globe and outer shell is filled with a safe, perfectly clear fluid that buoyantly supports the inner globe completely out of contact with the outer shell. This inner globe, floating and turning in a virtually friction-free environment and energized by light, is analogous to the earth itself. The MOVA globe is being brought to market at a time when people everywhere will understand and appreciate this analogy.The optical properties of the outer sell and fluid are carefully chosen so that the graphic features on the surface of the inner globe are magnified and appear to be on the outer surface of the outer shell. This means that the outer shell actually appears to move.The MOVA globe can rest on an attractive three fingered stand that is provided, or on just about any other kind of stand that can be chosen to complement it's graphic design. They appear to rotate in spite of resting on the stand, in quiet defiance of commonly held ideas about the laws of friction.A carefully designed, and highly efficient drive mechanism within the inner globe drives the rotation even in room light. Energy for the drive is provided by very advanced solar cells within the inner globe, illuminated by light passing through the graphic on the globe. The drive includes a magnetic element that reacts with the earth's magnetic field, much as a common compass does, to provide torque to drive the globe.All of these elements of the MOVA globe cooperate to create a beautiful, magical object that provides a meditative point of focus to any room.

About Us - MOVA Technologies























































 


 






					Tomorrow's Filtration Technology Delivered Today				










About Us




History

MOVA Technologies, Inc. is an emerging technology company based in Pulaski, Virginia that was formed to commercialize panel-bed filtration technology, a particulate matter and gaseous substance filter system developed by Dr. Arthur M. Squires. This new method will help to reduce the maintenance and operating filtration costs associated with carbon-based fuel plants, incinerators, and chemical manufacturing, while improving the overall emission quality. MOVA Technologies will enable these fuel facilities to meet emission control standards without lowering the efficiency of their business operations.
Dr. Squires, a chemical engineer, invented the technology that MOVA is bringing to market. He believed carbon-based fuels should and would be part of our energy source in the years to come. Dr. Squires wanted to find a better process and technology that would remove chemicals in a clean and efficient way, leading to the development of panel-bed filtration.
To ensure the technology would be commercialized, he placed the patents in a Trust. The patents cover technology related to panel-bed filtration that utilizes solid sorbents to filter out carbon-based emissions. Steve Critchfield has taken the initiative to launch the business and start the process of commercializing Dr. Squires' patented ideas.
 
Our Mission
Our mission is to become the premier provider of environmentally safe and accepted filtration practices for carbon-based fuels, incinerators, and chemical production facilities within the industrial world.
 
Our Goals

To commercialize our proven technology of capturing particulate matter and gaseous substances more effectively and efficiently than the industry standard.
To isolate additional offensive effluents from the emissions of carbon-based fuel facilities using solid sorbent materials.
To satisfy EPA mandated regulations, allowing retirement-bound carbon-based fuel facilities to continue operations, and extending the lives of currently run carbon-based fuel facilities so that clean, affordable processes can continue for years to come.

 
Our Core Values
We will pursue our mission through a set of core values and standards as seen through Dr. Squires, who respected his co-workers, never stopped inventing and improving, and worked with a team committed to succeeding.

Integrity – We endorse the highest standards of honesty and integrity among our employees, partners, customers, and communities.


Innovation – We foster an environment that encourages constant innovation and improvement in our business practices, ensuring continuous growth and business development.


Teamwork – We believe teamwork leverages our individual strengths, allowing us to utilize our human capital to the highest degree. Dr. Squires achieved remarkable results throughout his career often as part of a team committed to success.

MOVA® Technology

MOVA ® Creations represent the highest level of expertise in technology and science to simulate perpetual motion with ambient light and the earth’s magnetic field. With each one built to last, MOVA® Creations require detail, precision and craftsmanship in every aspect of development.

How They’re Made: MOVA® Creations are assembled by hand. We use only the most premium materials, including finely polished polymer resin hemisphere shells and a careful mixture of non-toxic fluids to allow our globes to rotate freely.
Inner Workings: A sophisticated motion mechanism, powered by ambient light, rests discreetly inside each globe. Consisting of solar cells, magnetic elements and other proprietary components, the mechanism drives the continuous rotation without any batteries or power cords.
Graphics: Our graphics are carefully designed for spherical objects, maintaining aspect ratios and composition while also taking into account how the movement of our creations will ultimately enhance the designs.
Printing: Our patented printing technique allows the graphics to be transparent enough to let light permeate the globe but also opaque enough to conceal the inner workings. Precise color combinations and specialty inks are used to ensure an impeccable finished print.
Assembly: Each MOVA® Creation is meticulously assembled by hand to ensure that a high-quality, well-engineered masterpiece reaches the hands of our customers. After printing and forming the shells, the motion mechanism is placed inside and the two hemispheres are joined together and checked for accuracy and alignment. Once the outer shell, or cube, is assembled around the inner globe, our patented liquid fills the space to allow for frictionless movement. The finished product is then polished to perfection and packaged for delivery to MOVA enthusiasts all around the world.

 MOVA Globes

		MOVA globes are simply some of the most technologically advanced and aesthetically pleasing globes on the market today. Also popularly known as the "MOVA spinning globe," these beauties bring together superior technology with a simple yet stunning design for world globes that are completely unique and one-of-a-kind.
	

		MOVA globes use the power of ambient light in conjunction with a layer of safe fluid in between two of the globe's layers to give the sphere a natural rotation that simulates the very rotation of our Earth. They provide the appearance of magically "floating" and gently moving, adding decorative appeal and a "wow" factor to any coffee table, office desk, or end table. Perhaps most impressively, MOVA's globes require absolutely no power source to operate! Each globe stands on a crystal clear acrylic base that allows the sphere to rotate smoothly and efficiently without batteries or power cords. The technology is as simple as it is innovative - a difficult and winning combination to achieve.
	

		MOVA Globes' unique spheres are smaller than traditional desktop globes, making them an ideal fit for small spaces such as a tight workstation, a bookshelf, or a small table. We offer one of the best selection of MOVA globes available anywhere, with a style, size and color for any decorating aesthetic. Choose from classic blue oceans to sleek black, featuring traditional world geography, a terrestrial view with cloud cover, a beautiful and symbolic version of the Heart Sutra, or even a globe of Jupiter! There's something here for everyone with these innovative pieces of art. Order your MOVA globe today for free shipping on one of your new favorite treasures!

About the MOVA Globes
How the MOVA Globe Works
The world's most advanced globe, the MOVA globe rotates silently and is inspired by the earth itself. It requires no power cords or batteries, only the natural light of your home or office. The three-fingered acrylic base is included with every MOVA globe.The MOVA globe rotates peacefully and silently using only the energy of room light and the force of the earth's magnetic field. This is possible because the MOVA globe is actually an inner globe that rotates and is contained within an outer shell made of very clear acrylic that does not rotate. The thin space between the inner globe and outer shell is filled with a safe, perfectly clear fluid that buoyantly supports the inner globe completely out of contact with the outer shell. This inner globe, floating and turning in a virtually friction-free environment and energized by light, is analogous to the earth itself. The MOVA globe is being brought to market at a time when people everywhere will understand and appreciate this analogy.The optical properties of the outer sell and fluid are carefully chosen so that the graphic features on the surface of the inner globe are magnified and appear to be on the outer surface of the outer shell. This means that the outer shell actually appears to move.The MOVA globe can rest on an attractive three fingered stand that is provided, or on just about any other kind of stand that can be chosen to complement it's graphic design. They appear to rotate in spite of resting on the stand, in quiet defiance of commonly held ideas about the laws of friction.A carefully designed, and highly efficient drive mechanism within the inner globe drives the rotation even in room light. Energy for the drive is provided by very advanced solar cells within the inner globe, illuminated by light passing through the graphic on the globe. The drive includes a magnetic element that reacts with the earth's magnetic field, much as a common compass does, to provide torque to drive the globe.All of these elements of the MOVA globe cooperate to create a beautiful, magical object that provides a meditative point of focus to any room.
