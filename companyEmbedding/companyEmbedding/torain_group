Security
Security is a pain. There are constant headlines about security breaches and new threats to your accounts. The goal is to do what is necessary to protect your data while making it as simple as possible so you can work.
Good backups and planning for the worst assure that even if your security or data integrity is compromised, your business is intact and can recover quickly.
Compliance – We can help you develop and implement a security policy and plan for your business that fits your situation. You can use our experience to meet the compliance and regulatory requirements for your industry. We work with HIPAA, Red Flag, PCI compliance, and many other industry specific needs. More on compliance…
Managed Antivirus – The biggest problem we see with Virus protection is that it is not kept up. Even though it may automatically update, many small business users don’t take the time to install new versions when they come out, and keep up with changes in the industry. We recommend an antivirus product that integrates with our network monitoring and management. We get notified when a virus or malware is detected on your computers and can take immediate action if needed.
Patch management – most security breaches take advantage of known flaws in existing software. Patch management provides low cost, consistent, automated ways of making sure your computers stay up to date, and detecting any failed updates.
Firewall – the right balance of firewall settings allow you to share information over the internet only with those you intend to. We are dealers for and trained in most firewall products including Cisco, SonicWall, WatchGuard, Fortinet, Barracuda, and others.
Web filtering – Most malware is now delivered simply by visiting the wrong website, or clicking on a malicious ad. Some of this can be caught and prevented by using software that is aware of and catches malicious web browsing activity.
Network management – By using a server based network, you can apply security policies to improve security. We can help determine what is best for your business.
Passwords – One of the biggest security issues is the management of all the website logins you need to have to conduct business. We recommend and help implement LastPass – a password management tool that gives you control of the many logins your employees need to do their job. We also recommend setting up some form of 2 factor authentication, and have worked with biometric and token based security systems.
Mobile devices, wireless and remote access – keep it secure by understanding the risks and preventing problems.
Inventory – We can help you keep track of your IT assets and software licenses.

Business Continuity



Business Continuity
For any business owner, three objectives exist when planning to prevent or recover from a disaster:

The assurance of never losing critical information
Reducing downtime when emergencies happen
Quick recovery after a loss of data.

These three objectives translate into three IT services:

Backups: The process of protecting your data by copying it to a secure device so that it can be easily and and quickly recovered in case of loss.
Disaster Recovery: The process of reinstating crucial business data and procedures after a disaster happens.
Business Continuity: A carefully constructed plan that specifies exactly how your company will recover and re-establish disrupted functions after disaster strikes.

Backups are an essential part of your IT strategy, even if you just have a single computer at your home office. Changes in technology have opened up new options for backup. Cloud computing offers large amounts of storage at low cost. Improvements in broadband service make it more practical to consider backing up over your internet connection.   Imaging tools combined with Virtual Machine technology make it feasible for small business to recover from a lost server in hours instead of days.
However, the fundamentals of disaster prevention have not changed. A backup and disaster prevention strategy is still created by thinking through these issues:

Identify the data that is critical to your business, and where it is stored. Be aware of where your email is stored. Identify programs that use some form of database that runs on a server, which may have special backup requirements. Identify offsite data that may need protection as well, such as your website.
Identify dependencies – Determine which services, such as internet access, are required for your business to function.
Identify information that may be required to restore services – vendor contacts, software media and license keys, passwords etc.
Consider the types of things that could go wrong, how likely they are, and the consequences.
Determine how long you can be without specific types of data or functionality if these things did go wrong, and what the cost would be, including the cost of loss or temporary unavailability. This determines your “service level”.



Create a backup and disaster prevention plan which allows you to recover functionality within the requirements of your service level. Create accountability by determining who is responsible.
Develop a plan to monitor and regularly test your business continuity strategy.

Security and disaster prevention are closely related. Preventing Viruses and Hackers has become a critical part of staying in business.
We can consult with you to help develop a good plan of action, and then implement and monitor it. We offer solutions for local and offsite backup.





Suggested Best Practices
Good Procedures
Have an acceptable use policy. This should include a policy on where business data is and is not stored. This will reduce the chances of getting viruses, and other things users can do to damage the systems. Have and follow a security plan. Again, this prevents problems. Have and follow a preventative maintenance plan. Monitoring and maintenance can often prevent problems before they disrupt business.  Clearly define job roles for backup and disaster prevention. Build in accountability. Keep good documentation.
Backups
Get backup software that can back up any specialized software such as databases or email systems.  Make sure you can restore a file from as far back in time as needed by keeping multiple copies of your backups. Set it up to notify you of problems.
Imaging
Use software that will make a complete image of key computers and servers. Make these images regularly, and keep them separate from the system being imaged. Back up the image offsite. Test your ability to restore an image and use the system.
Keep critical data offsite
In addition to offsite backups and images, keep a list of software licenses with keys, documentation on configuration and installation procedures sufficient to rebuild critical equipment, and vendor contact information including account numbers and logins. Keep a copy of all software needed to rebuild your IT systems offsite. In particular, the server operating system and the backup software.
Put redundant parts in servers
Servers can be ordered with redundant power supplies, and redundant hard drives. These are the parts most likely to fail.
Buy more than one of the same equipment
Troubleshooting is much quicker and easier if you have the ability to swap out identical parts. Establish hardware standards.
Use a Battery backup.
Put a hefty UPS on each server, with software that will automatically shut it down if the power stays off. Sudden loss of power can cause the server data to be corrupted. An orderly shutdown prevents this. Schedule regular tests of the battery, and replace it when needed. They usually last 2-3 years.
Keep critical spare parts.
If justified, keep spares of power supplies, hard drives, and other key parts for equipment which can’t be down long enough to order parts

We have worked closely with a number of medical offices over the years.
We understand the unique security needs of medical offices, including HIPAA compliance.
We are familiar with and support e-clinical works, PrimeSuite, MDS, Dentrix (Dental) and other commonly used medical management software. We support faxing solutions, and have integrated them with billing systems.
We have worked with Kaweah Delta IT dept. to set up remote access to Elmer and other tools.
Richard Pantera, M.D. (now retired)
“To Whom It May Concern:
I have a small private Neurology practice in Visalia. Torian Group has been providing network and consulting services to us since 1994. Tim Torian has provided on site service and support including: our Novell 2.15 network, he upgraded our server to NetWare 2.2, to Windows NT, and recently to Windows Small Business Server. He and his staff have diagnosed problems with the network including replacing a bad server motherboard, and various workstation hardware and software problems. We have also gotten help with long range planning for our network.
Recently I have been developing web pages for Central Valley Independent Physicians, an independent physician organization I am involved with. Torian Group has hosted our web site, provided technical help with setting up the web pages and web page design. Tim Torian has been very helpful with training and support.
I am very pleased with the support and consulting help I have received from Tim. He has always responded quickly and effectively to our problems. I have a strong technical background in artificial intelligence and computers, and have always been impressed with the depth and breadth of Tim’s expertise and help. I have received help with programming and database design problems, Internet systems design and planning, and research on paperless office systems.
He is also able to work well with and support our staff, some of whom know very little about computers. He always is a reassurance to the employees. I have watched his business grow over the last few years, and seen him continue to stay up with the industry and learn with the continuing changes.
I would recommend Tim Torian and Torian Group to anyone in need of these types of services.”
Richard Pantera, M.D.

Web Presence


Bring in the right customers and clients
Online marketing is now an essential part of doing business. You can significantly improve your reach, and be talking to potential customers 24 hours a day.  Unlike mass marketing, which creates interest in local audiences through ads in newspapers, radio spots and billboards, internet marketing allows you to cultivate a more personal connection with consumers around the world, delivering valuable content through low-cost, personalized communication.
Your web presence should include a website, a blog, social media, and most important, local search.  When looking for a product or service, many now search on their phone or tablet. A responsive website will adapt to the format of the screen, allowing you to be found online easily at the moment someone is looking for your product or service.  A strong local search presence will help you show up in search engines.
