Jack Whittaker (lottery winner)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Andrew Whittaker)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Andrew Jackson "Jack" Whittaker, Jr. (born c. 1947 in Jumping Branch, West Virginia) is the winner of a 2002 lottery jackpot. When he won US$314.9 million in the Powerball multi-state lottery it was, at the time, the largest jackpot ever won by a single winning ticket in the history of American lottery. After winning the lottery, he had several brushes with the law, as well as personal tragedies.[1]

Powerball win[edit]
Whittaker was the 55-year-old president of Diversified Enterprises Construction, a contracting firm in Putnam County, West Virginia, when he chose the winning numbers for the December 25, 2002 Powerball drawing. Whittaker already had a net worth of over US$17 million before his windfall. Whittaker purchased the winning ticket at a supermarket in Hurricane, West Virginia, where he had stopped for a deli breakfast sandwich and to get fuel for his vehicle.
The jackpot that day was a US$314.9 million annuity or US$170.5 million cash. Whittaker chose the cash option of US$113,386,407, after taxes.[2][3][4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Whittaker pledged 10% of his winnings to Christian charities—including several churches affiliated with the Church of God—in southern West Virginia. One of the beneficiary congregations constructed a multimillion-dollar church in Hurricane. He also donated $14 million to establish the Jack Whittaker Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides food and clothing to low-income families in rural West Virginia. Moreover, for the deli manager who served the biscuits at the convenience store where he purchased the winning ticket, he purchased a $123,000 house and a new Jeep Grand Cherokee and gave her a check for $44,000.[2][5]
Legal and personal problems[edit]
On August 5, 2003, less than a year after Whittaker won the lottery, thieves broke into his car while it was parked at a strip club in Cross Lanes, West Virginia. The thieves made away with $545,000 in cash that Whittaker carried around in a suitcase.[6] When asked why he would carry that much money around with him, Whittaker responded "because I can". In another incident, two employees at the club, the general manager and a dancer-manager who were romantically linked, were arrested and charged with a plot to put drugs in Whittaker's drinks and then rob him.[5] On January 25, 2004, thieves once again broke into his car, this time making off with an estimated $200,000 in cash, but this was later recovered.
On September 16, 2004, Jesse Tribble, an 18-year-old on-and-off-again boyfriend of Whittaker's granddaughter Brandi Bragg, was found dead in Whittaker's home in Teays Valley, West Virginia.[7] A coroner's report indicated that he had died from overdosing on a combination of oxycodone, methadone, meperidine, and cocaine.
On December 20, 2004, Brandi Bragg, 17, was found dead on the property of a male friend after being reported missing on December 9. Her body was wrapped inside a plastic tarpaulin and dumped behind a junked van. No one was charged with a crime. Cocaine and methadone were found in her system, but the cause of death was listed as "undetermined."[5]
At an October 11, 2005 hearing related to his January 2003 DUI, a visibly shaken Whittaker lashed out at local law enforcement agencies for focusing on his troubles while failing to arrest anyone in relation to his granddaughter's death.[8]

Go after whoever killed my granddaughter with as much zealous [sic] as these butt holes are trying to convict me of something I didn't do.

Whittaker was later sued by Caesars Atlantic City casino for bouncing $1.5 million worth of checks to cover gambling losses. He countersued, claiming that his losses were supposed to be credited due to a slot machine he developed and that they in fact owed him money.[9]
On January 11, 2007, a legal complaint against Whittaker alleged he claimed that on September 11, 2006, thieves took all of his money.[10] The thieves, according to the account, went to 12 branches of the City National Bank and cashed 12 checks. The incident came to light because Whittaker had not been paying money to a woman who had previously sued him. Kitti French filed the complaint earlier in the week, requesting court costs and money from Whittaker.
On July 5, 2009, Ginger Whittaker Bragg, Whittaker's 42-year-old daughter and the mother of Brandi Bragg, was found dead in Daniels, West Virginia. No explanation was given, but officials did not suspect foul play.[11]
On December 2, 2016 around 7:00 a.m. Whittaker's home in Bland County, Virginia was reported to be on fire. When firefighters arrived, the home was fully engulfed. The house was deemed a total loss. Whittaker's wife was home when the fire broke out, but she was able to make it out safely and no injuries were reported. Whittaker stated that the home was not insured.[12]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Andrew Jackson "Jack" Whittaker, Jr. (born c. 1947 in Jumping Branch, West Virginia) is the winner of a 2002 lottery jackpot. When he won US$314.9 million in the Powerball multi-state lottery it was, at the time, the largest jackpot ever won by a single winning ticket in the history of American lottery. After winning the lottery, he had several brushes with the law, as well as personal tragedies.[1]

Powerball win[edit]
Whittaker was the 55-year-old president of Diversified Enterprises Construction, a contracting firm in Putnam County, West Virginia, when he chose the winning numbers for the December 25, 2002 Powerball drawing. Whittaker already had a net worth of over US$17 million before his windfall. Whittaker purchased the winning ticket at a supermarket in Hurricane, West Virginia, where he had stopped for a deli breakfast sandwich and to get fuel for his vehicle.
The jackpot that day was a US$314.9 million annuity or US$170.5 million cash. Whittaker chose the cash option of US$113,386,407, after taxes.[2][3][4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Whittaker pledged 10% of his winnings to Christian charities—including several churches affiliated with the Church of God—in southern West Virginia. One of the beneficiary congregations constructed a multimillion-dollar church in Hurricane. He also donated $14 million to establish the Jack Whittaker Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides food and clothing to low-income families in rural West Virginia. Moreover, for the deli manager who served the biscuits at the convenience store where he purchased the winning ticket, he purchased a $123,000 house and a new Jeep Grand Cherokee and gave her a check for $44,000.[2][5]
Legal and personal problems[edit]
On August 5, 2003, less than a year after Whittaker won the lottery, thieves broke into his car while it was parked at a strip club in Cross Lanes, West Virginia. The thieves made away with $545,000 in cash that Whittaker carried around in a suitcase.[6] When asked why he would carry that much money around with him, Whittaker responded "because I can". In another incident, two employees at the club, the general manager and a dancer-manager who were romantically linked, were arrested and charged with a plot to put drugs in Whittaker's drinks and then rob him.[5] On January 25, 2004, thieves once again broke into his car, this time making off with an estimated $200,000 in cash, but this was later recovered.
On September 16, 2004, Jesse Tribble, an 18-year-old on-and-off-again boyfriend of Whittaker's granddaughter Brandi Bragg, was found dead in Whittaker's home in Teays Valley, West Virginia.[7] A coroner's report indicated that he had died from overdosing on a combination of oxycodone, methadone, meperidine, and cocaine.
On December 20, 2004, Brandi Bragg, 17, was found dead on the property of a male friend after being reported missing on December 9. Her body was wrapped inside a plastic tarpaulin and dumped behind a junked van. No one was charged with a crime. Cocaine and methadone were found in her system, but the cause of death was listed as "undetermined."[5]
At an October 11, 2005 hearing related to his January 2003 DUI, a visibly shaken Whittaker lashed out at local law enforcement agencies for focusing on his troubles while failing to arrest anyone in relation to his granddaughter's death.[8]

Go after whoever killed my granddaughter with as much zealous [sic] as these butt holes are trying to convict me of something I didn't do.

Whittaker was later sued by Caesars Atlantic City casino for bouncing $1.5 million worth of checks to cover gambling losses. He countersued, claiming that his losses were supposed to be credited due to a slot machine he developed and that they in fact owed him money.[9]
On January 11, 2007, a legal complaint against Whittaker alleged he claimed that on September 11, 2006, thieves took all of his money.[10] The thieves, according to the account, went to 12 branches of the City National Bank and cashed 12 checks. The incident came to light because Whittaker had not been paying money to a woman who had previously sued him. Kitti French filed the complaint earlier in the week, requesting court costs and money from Whittaker.
On July 5, 2009, Ginger Whittaker Bragg, Whittaker's 42-year-old daughter and the mother of Brandi Bragg, was found dead in Daniels, West Virginia. No explanation was given, but officials did not suspect foul play.[11]
On December 2, 2016 around 7:00 a.m. Whittaker's home in Bland County, Virginia was reported to be on fire. When firefighters arrived, the home was fully engulfed. The house was deemed a total loss. Whittaker's wife was home when the fire broke out, but she was able to make it out safely and no injuries were reported. Whittaker stated that the home was not insured.[12]

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline
Find out whether an attorney has ever been disciplined.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Whittaker attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

Horse's Mouth: Holly Whittaker and Philip Poole, Whittaker’s | StopPress
      
StopPressMarketing, advertising & media intelligence
                Horse's Mouth: Holly Whittaker and Philip Poole, Whittaker’s
        Horse's MouthJune 8, 2015StopPress TeamFor 119 years, the Whittaker name has been synonymous with chocolate in New Zealand. But rather than resting on tradition, the small team has developed new products, collaborated with other brands (including the recently leaked Jelly Tip block) and consequently left consumers curious about what will come next. Here are a few family secrets.On family heritagePhilip Poole, head of marketing (PP): The company was founded in 1896 by James Henry Whittaker. Brian and Andrew Whittaker own the company now and they are third generation Whittakers. Holly and Matt Whittaker are also in the company, so there is a fourth generation there, so the dynasty lives on, as it were. It’s very important because with Brian and Andrew, for example, they’re still very much involved with the business. They still get into the factory at 6.30 in the morning and make sure everything is set up correctly. They are very hands-on, particularly in terms of the factory, and that translates into the quality of the chocolate. They’re absolutely rigorous about producing premium quality chocolate, because we operate in a very competitive market. We’re up against Cadbury, Nestle, Lindt, which are all major multi-nationals and very good blue chip companies. And the thing we need to do is make sure we do everything better than them otherwise we won’t prosper. We certainly have an ambition to be the best. It also gives you consistency. We have a very clear vision, which is: ‘The world eating world-class chocolate from Porirua.’ Holly Whittaker, marketing manager (HW): Having a family heritage is a real point of difference and an advantage over the other competitors in the market. It creates consumer trust and loyalty, because there’s a connection to New Zealand. We are a New Zealand family and a New Zealand-run business, so that resonates with the New Zealand consumer very positively.
 On a changing marketPP: The main thing that has changed over time is the building of the company. Brian and Andrew have invested a huge amount in the factory and the machinery today is world-class. They’ve also really expanded a company that was originally based on the peanut slab until about ten to 15 years ago. Since then, the company has really developed into other areas, like the blocks, squares, chunks and so forth. They’ve really developed the product range. I would say that the product strategy is where the biggest change has occurred.   On the younger generations talking to the mediaPP: Brian and Andrew are just very private people and they prefer to remain private. But with Matt and Holly coming in at a time when the business is expanding so much, it’s a chance to introduce them to consumers.
HW: I guess we see the media as positive opportunity and not so much as a threat. And in the last few years, we’ve seen how much value it has added to the business by engaging with the media. Because we are a family business, there are personalities involved. And by putting a face to the name, so to speak, it builds a stronger rapport. So it’s really proving a successful strategy.On being a trusted brandPP: We are a family-owned New Zealand company, and we also have strong principles in that none of our products have palm oil in them. So, it’s a combination of those things, but it also goes back to the quality of the product. Chocolate is a small indulgence and customers don’t want to be disappointed. Most people are experts on chocolate as well. They know what they like, because they’re putting it into their mouths.Hello Chocolate Lovers. These blocks are extra good. They help communities improve healthcare in Ghana. You can be in to win some here: http://whittake.rs/nzchocolate
Posted by Whittaker's Chocolate Lovers on Tuesday, 12 May 2015
HW: Because people are so familiar with the products and because we’ve been around for 119 years now, people have grown up with that nostalgic peanut slab. It’s trustworthy, reliable, and fortunately we haven’t let our chocolate lovers down ever. It also comes down to our values and how we communicate online. We have very strong two-way dialogue with social media, and the fact that we actually listen and respond to chocolate lovers goes a long way toward having that most-trusted brand status. On getting social media rightHW: It’s been a long-term strategy for us as part of our brand. We got into social media quite a long time ago and we’ve always been very clear on our values. We’ve taken the time to be very active and responsive. We monitor the community very closely and reply. It’s also a great way to share news, and we’re always trying to innovate, surprise and reward our loyal chocolate lovers. It’s a great platform, and we’re very fortunate to have a product that so many people have a very strong emotional connection to. With traditional media, you have one-way communication, and by allowing our communities to participate and talk to each other as well has been very valuable. On brand collaborationsPP: We realised that we’ve got a pretty strong property with the Whittaker’s brand, and chocolate is a small indulgence and there are other products that are also small indulgences that can link up to chocolate. Chocolate milk is obviously one of those, and we also have an ice-cream collaboration with Killinchy Gold. So it’s really part of the brand development in those other premium areas in terms of linking with those products where there’s a natural connection. So if you take Lewis Road Creamery, it’s a premium New Zealand brand and chocolate milk just seemed a natural collaboration. On the movement against unhealthy food 
HW: I think that other products like fast food and soft drinks are products that people consume as part of their everyday diet. When consumers start to replace water with soft drinks, this is where the problem arises. But with chocolate it’s something you have on the odd occasion as a treat. There are times when a birthday cake is allowed or a glass of Champagne. It’s about a sense of occasion. 
   On maintaining qualityPP: We’re the only company in New Zealand that does the whole manufacturing process from bean to bar: importing the cocoa beans, roasting them, refining them, and doing the whole nine yards until the final product. We could import cocoa liquor, but we don’t do that because we want to maintain the quality. Andrew and Brian have built up a huge knowledge in terms of where to source the best ingredients from, be it cocoa, almonds or macadamias.On shifting ad spend to digitalHW: I just had a bit of look today and spoke to our media strategist. Going back five years the split was 90-10. That’s 90 percent in traditional media and ten percent in digital. And now the split is 60-40, so 60 percent in traditional and 40 percent in digital. And that shift toward digital is likely to continue. 
PP: Most of this digital spend goes toward Facebook, YouTube and Google, but television is still very important for us. The emotional values of a brand are important, and I think TV is still very successful in communicating these to consumers.On staying ahead PP: This industry is very competitive, but we have a clear strategy that has been very successful for us over the past ten years and that has seen our market share grow. We will continue that, but the competition isn’t going to go away. That’s why we’re still completely focused on being the best, and that’s what we work towards. We have a relatively small group of very hardworking and smart people working towards that. On working with agenciesHW: In terms of a small team of people, we also have very strong relationships with our advertising, media and sales agencies. These are all long-term relationships that have contributed to the success. 
PP: We currently use Assignment Group for our creative work, MBM is our media agency and Tell works on the digital side. Creatives Howard Greive, John Plimmer and Chris Bleakley have worked with the business since the mid 90s—at different agencies, but the people are still the same. [This is also the case] for Matt Bale who drives the media at MBM. On building the brandPP: In terms of the brand, we’ve got significant plans to continue building the brand, but anything we do will always be measured against whether it’s adding to the quality of the brand and the quality of the product. That is always our focus.On the pressure of innovatingPP: I think pressure is a good thing. It gets the adrenaline running. And we’re lucky in that everyone that currently works on the Whittaker’s brand really enjoys it. I don’t think we would be successful if we didn’t enjoy what we do. And we enjoy what we do and we will continue to do that.
HW: Fortunately, in chocolate-making, it is very vast and there are many directions we could go in. There are always new ideas coming to the table from marketing, export, the directors, and so on. Everyone is always very forthcoming with new ideas. So, we’re stuck in terms of innovation. It’s generally a question of how we’re going to do it. That’s really exciting and it gets everyone working toward the goal.  On whether there’ll be brand collaborations in 2015PP: The short answer is ‘yes’. And the next one is: ‘I can’t tell you what they are’ … We do have something coming and when it’s released, we’ll send you [NZ Marketing] samples of it … Strangely enough, we have the agency outside the meeting room at the moment and they’re going to present the next campaign for us. Hello Chocolate lovers. J H Whittaker may well have Jelly on the mind. Here's a tip…keep your eye on #July.

                    Who's it for: My Food Bag by Saatchi & SaatchiWhy we like it: When My Food Bag's Bargain Box ambassador Julian Dennison departed for Hollywood to film Deadpool 2, he left some big shoes to fill, and we reckon the young Kiwi chefs in this fun and quirky spot manage a pretty good job. Not only does it remind the audience what Bargain Box is all about, the kids act as a genuine endorsement as they're real Bargain Box fans sought through the company's Facebook page. Those featured in the spot are young chefs who can now add brand ambassadors to their list of talents.Who's it for:Seafood New ZealandWhy we like it: While many New Zealand brands promote a commitment to the environment and sustainable practices, this spot for Seafood New Zealand takes a different approach by introducing New Zealand to those who help make that happen. While the voice over tells the story of how Seafood New Zealand plans to ensure local waters are teeming with fish for generations to come and admits that it doesn't always get it right, the faces of the men and women working the industry proves there are people willing to make it a reality. The diversity of those included, from young women to older men, also shows it's a commitment all of New Zealand is standing behind.Who's it for: National PartyWhy we like it: At a time when every word is being picked apart by a fine-tooth comb National has decided that singing is the best approach. As the upbeat song plays, a montage of shots presents the diversity of New Zealanders, which include fishermen, rugby players, businessmen, families, farmers and fruit pickers who are all united by the words 'Let's get together now'. Concluding with a round of applause, it also shows the support the National Party—or they could be cheering on Bill English as he runs.
