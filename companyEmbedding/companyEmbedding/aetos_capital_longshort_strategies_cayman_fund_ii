Outsourced CIO
Since 2003, Aetos has offered full portfolio and asset class-specific outsourced services.  We work with clients to define and review investment objectives and policies, develop appropriate asset allocations, evaluate and select investment managers across a diversified range of traditional and alternative asset classes, as well as manage liquidity needs, risk tolerances, liabilities and spending requirements.

History

Advantage
Below are four key factors that we believe differentiate Aetos from our peers:
Fiduciary Perspective
Aetos’ Co-Founder Anne Casscells brings a unique perspective to investing, having previously served as Chief Investment Officer of Stanford Management Company.  Our senior investment professionals also average more than 20 years of hedge fund investing experience as fiduciaries, in addition to deep capital markets expertise across asset classes, securities, and investment strategies.
Knowledge Sharing/“Extension of Staff”
At Aetos, we pride ourselves on the high level of knowledge transfer with our clients’ investment staffs, whereby individuals have access to senior Aetos investment leadership.  In addition to portfolio details, we share economic and market insights across traditional and alternative strategies, as well as provide training and education on best practices across areas such as strategy allocation, investment and operational due diligence, and risk management.
Significant Investor in Hedge Funds and Other Alternative Investment Strategies
Aetos is large enough to access the most sought-after hedge funds, yet nimble enough to identify unique alpha sources and make investments of meaningful size.  Our size and industry stature often enable us to negotiate favorable terms on behalf of clients.
Customized Investment Solutions
Creating customized portfolios is in Aetos’ DNA, starting with our first portfolio in 2001.  Currently, approximately 80% of our current assets under management are in highly customized mandates, including multi-strategy and specialty portfolios structured according to our clients’ investment needs.

Ancillary Services
As knowledge sharing and acting as an extension of a client’s staff is a hallmark of our firm, we partner with clients by providing a variety of ancillary services.  For clients seeking this level of interaction, we create partnerships that are flexible and comprehensive with a defined set of deliverables based on a client’s requirements.  Our knowledge sharing can encompass non-discretionary assistance with direct investments, risk aggregation across a client’s entire program, as well as staff and board education.  We also employ our broad operational, accounting and legal expertise to provide a variety of back office and business support functions as part of our investment management services.

and, the Aetos Funds do not vote proxies or participate in tender offers, because said Funds do not own individual securities.PERAC Approval Date: May 15, 2006Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.00, 17.00, 18.00, 19.00 and 21.00: Notwithstanding the provisions of 840 CMR 16.00 et seq., the Worcester Retirement Board may be permitted to invest funds of the Worcester Retirement System in BPIF Non-Taxable L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Fund”), noting that as a so-called hedge fund of funds, the Fund invests in other funds, and while Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P., the Fund’s general partner (“General Partner”) can comply with the provisions of 840 CMR 16.00 et seq. with respect to the Fund’s direct investments, it cannot make such representations regarding any indirect investments, or the investments of the funds which it does not directly manage.PERAC Approval Date: December 12, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with Investment Guideline 99-3, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to invest in Northstar Mezzanine Partners IV.  The system has been a satisfied investor in Northstar Mezzanine Partners III, the immediate predecessor fund, and has submitted updated Disclosure Statement and Exemption Application forms.PERAC Approval Date: October 19, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 19.01(8): The Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to increase the Board’s maximum allocation to alternative investments (venture capital, private equity, et. al.) from the current regulatory maximum of 5% of total portfolio assets at the time of investment to 10%.  The Board’s current allocation is about 4% and it is unlikely that the allocation will rise as high as 10%.  Nevertheless, because of the special challenges involved in investing in this asset class, the Board would like the flexibility to exceed the existing 5% limit.  The Board has had experience investing in alternative investments since 1992.PERAC Approval Date: June 24, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to modify its large cap equity mandate with State Street Global Advisors by transferring assets from the S&P 500 Index Fund to the Russell 1000 Value and Russell 1000 Growth index funds.  Together, the two Russell 1000 funds cover the same large cap universe as the S&P 500, but the separation into the two style-specific funds will offer the board greater flexibility to control risk, and to take advantage of opportunities, relative to its growth/value allocation.PERAC Approval Date: May 6, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 19.01(6): Notwithstanding the provisions of Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission regulations, including 840 CMR 21.01(6), the City of Worcester Retirement Board may exercise its investment discretion to invest funds of the City of Worcester Retirement System (the “System”) in the shares of a real estate investment trust known as Hancock Timberland VII Inc. (the “Fund”), as contemplated by 840 CMR 19.01(6), and while funds of the System are invested in shares of the Fund, for purposes of applying the rules set forth in 840 CMR 16.00 et seq. and 17.00 et seq., investments of the System shall not be deemed to include any of the underlying assets of the Fund, but shall only include the shares of the Fund, and the Fund shall not be deemed to be an investment manager or fiduciary to the System; provided that at all times the Fund qualifies as a “real estate operating company” within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and the regulations promulgated there under, or the assets of the Fund are otherwise not treated as “plan assets” of the System.PERAC Approval Date: May 2, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-3, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to invest in Charlesbank Equity Fund VI.  The Board has been a satisfied investor in the predecessor fund, Charlesbank Equity Fund V.PERAC Approval Date: January 31, 2005Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to make a modest modification to its large cap equity index mandate with State Street Global Advisors.  Standard & Poor’s has announced that it will be adopting a free-float methodology for all their U.S. equity indexes, with final implementation scheduled for September 2005.  In order to help address concerns over the possible market impact of this rebalancing, S&P has created provisional indexes.  In hopes of avoiding whatever market impacts might be caused by the full transformation later this year, the Worcester Retirement Board has decided to switch from SSGA’s S&P 500 Index Fund to the SSGA S&P 500 Flagship Securities Lending Provisional Fund.PERAC Approval Date: February 25, 2004Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 19.01(6): Notwithstanding the provisions of Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission regulations, the City of Worcester Retirement Board may invest funds of the City of Worcester Retirement System (the “System”) with a real estate investment fund, as contemplated by 840 CMR 19.01(4)-(6), known as Heitman Value Partners, L.P. (“the Fund”), and while the funds of the System are so invested the assets of the System shall be deemed to include, for purposes of applying the rules set forth in 840 CMR 16.00 et seq. and 17.00 et seq.; the System’s interest in the Fund but not any of the underlying assets of the Fund; provided that, at all times, the Fund qualifies as a “real estate operating company” or venture capital operating company” within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or the assets of the Fund otherwise would not be treated as subject to ERISA.PERAC Approval Date: October 27, 2003Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-3, the Worcester Retirement Board may invest in the Ascent Venture Partners IV Fund.  The board has been an investor in Ascent’s two predecessor funds and the investment results from those two partnerships have been satisfactory to date.PERAC Approval Date: October 20, 2003Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-3, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to invest in the Riverside Capital Appreciation Fund 2003.  This is the immediate successor fund to the Riverside Capital Appreciation Fund 2000, in which the Board invested in 2001.  The earlier fund has had strong performance to date and the new fund is to be managed by the same investment team and with the same investment objectives.PERAC Approval Date: September 22, 2003Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: Under the terms of Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement System is authorized to make a minor modification to its investment-grade fixed income mandate with Opus Investment Management.  Under this change, Opus will create a separate account for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), a segment of the market included in the universe the firm currently manages.  Since the United States has issued only ten offerings of TIPS bonds and the account will not require active management, Opus will manage this account for a fee of only 0.10% which is lower than the fee for the system’s existing core bond account.PERAC Approval Date: September 22, 2003Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: The Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to make a modest modification to its high-yield investment mandate with Loomis Sayles.  This modification involves no change in the overall investment objective or in the account’s benchmark.Under this modification, Loomis Sayles is authorized to invest in senior loans (“bank loans”) up to 20% of the market value of the account.  These are loans that are made by banks to the same universe of companies that comprises the high yield market.  Because these loans are typically senior in the capital structure as well as secured by collateral, they typically have better default recovery rates and superior risk-adjusted performance than conventional high-yield bonds.  Also, since these loans are adjustable-rate in nature, they have very little volatility from interest-rate changes.Thus, it is expected that the inclusion of senior loans will help to preserve principal and reduce volatility in the high-yield portfolio.PERAC Approval Date: June 13, 2001Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement Board may modify its international equity mandate with The Boston Company.  The Board currently invests in TBC’s International Equity Pooled Fund and TBC makes small tactical allocations to emerging markets through its Emerging Markets Pooled Fund.  TBC has created a single commingled fund, the Pooled Employees International ACWI (ex U.S.) Equity Fund by which to accomplish the same investment strategy in a more efficient manner.  The Board will incur no cost or change in fees by making this modification.PERAC Approval Date: August 14, 2001Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement Board is authorized to modify its fixed income management mandate with Loomis Sayles.  The existing mandate calls for Loomis to invest in “high yield” corporate bonds and lower-investment-grade corporate bonds in approximately equal amounts.  In order to simplify the board’s portfolio structure, the lower-investment-grade portion of the account will be eliminated and Loomis will concentrate on high- yield bonds.  The board has had a satisfactory relationship with Loomis Sayles for over five years and the firm is recognized within the industry as a leading manager of high-yield bonds.PERAC Approval Date: October 19, 2000Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: The Worcester Retirement System may invest in the Standard Life European Strategic Partners Fund.  This is an alternative investments “fund-of-funds” in which, according to an agreement between the Board and Standard Life, decisions as to the actual selection of investment partnerships will be made by Standard Life in a process not overseen by the Board.  The Board will periodically monitor the selection process used by Standard Life.PERAC Approval Date: April 6, 2000Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-2, the Worcester Retirement Board may re-allocate 50% of the assets currently invested in the SSGA S&P 500 Flagship Fund into the SSGA Equal Weighted S&P 500 Fund.  Under this modification, the Board will be invested in the same universe of stocks but will reduce its exposure to large capitalization growth stocks and increase its exposure to the smaller stocks within the S&P 500 Index.  The board believes this modification will decrease its exposure to stocks that may be over-valued and increase its exposure to stocks that may represent better value.PERAC Approval Date: March 20, 2000Investment/Supplemental RegulationRegulation Number 16.08: In accordance with PERAC Investment Guideline 99-3, the Worcester Retirement System may invest in Boston Millennia Partners II, L.P.  The System has not been invested in Boston Millennia Partners (BMP) I but information provided by the System, by the System’s Investment Consultant, and by the manager indicates that BMP II can be reasonably considered a successor fund to one of the System’s existing funds, Boston Capital Ventures (BCV) III.  The general partners and other key managers of BMP are essentially the same team that managed BCV III.  These men, led by Managing General Partner Dana Callow, Jr., created BMP in 1997, working initially in the same office space, and still maintain management responsibility for the investments in BVC III.  Also, the investment objective of BMP II is the same as for BCV III.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
