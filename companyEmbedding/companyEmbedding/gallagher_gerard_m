						Electric Fencing
					




HTML 02Electric fence is 50% less expensive to build and maintain than barbed wire according to the 2005 study by Iowa State University on estimated costs for livestock fencing. Perhaps the greatest benefit of all is that electric fencing can be a powerful pasture management tool.Gallagher electric fencing products can play a key role in helping you control the area to be grazed.  We offer both permanent and portable electric fence systems that allow specific areas of the pasture to be grazed, while other pastures are allowed to rest and regrow.
