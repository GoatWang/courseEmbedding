R&S®FT5066 Trusted Filter




 



Radio control information filter – red/black separation to STANAG.
The R&S®FT5066 trusted filter has been developed for a scenario consisting of a STANAG 5066 message handling application involving a radio and/or modem interface and a remote control protocol. The device provides firewall functionality for the radio's control information. Inserted in the control path of a system, the filter provides strict red/black separation. This ensures that only explicitly permitted control commands are transmitted and prevents (un)intentional data leakage over the control interface.
One aspect often neglected in a communications system is the threat caused by the transmission of control information. The path for control information is necessarily nearly always plain. As a result, it can be deliberately or unwittingly abused, e.g. through a programming error, to circumvent the encryption mode and transmit sensitive information openly. The R&S®FT5066 protects the control path and prevents accidental diversion of red data to the black side of the system.
Key facts
Rigid enforcement of classification boundary between red and black data
Prevents data leakage over the control interface
Operates in systems classified up to SECRET
Built-in tests and access control
Audio/visual status indicators and detailed logging function
Supports R&S®M3SR radios, Harris and RM6 as well as GA-123 modems

R&S®FT5066 Trusted Filter is a product of Rohde & Schwarz SIT GmbH, Stuttgart.
