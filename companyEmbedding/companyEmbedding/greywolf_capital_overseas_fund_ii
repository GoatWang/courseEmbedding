The Firm has earned a reputation for its commitment to integrity, transparency and alignment as a true partner with our investors.


Greywolf is a long-term investment partner, committed to the core principles of capital preservation, strong value orientation, quality and transparency.





Event Driven Strategies
CLO Credit Strategies




The Greywolf Event Driven strategy has approximately $605 million in assets allocated across approximately 10 to 20 of our best ideas. We believe our event-driven approach has low overlap with other funds and little to no correlation to the broad based markets. We seek to generate returns through well-researched catalyst-driven ideas, and when necessary we will hedge unwanted/uncompensated industry or market specific risks. We believe our investment approach combined with our low general market correlation make the event-driven strategy a strategic addition to an alternative portfolio.
Greywolf manages several CLO vehicles that invest primarily in portfolios of leveraged loans and high-yield bonds. Greywolf also manages a Corporate CLO focused strategy that invests in third party CLO debt and equity, along with numerous client specific CLO focused vehicles.   By integrating our research analysts on the Event Driven team into the CLO process, we believe we are able to gain a competitive advantage in identifying CLO debt and equity positions with superior credit quality.  We are dedicated to customizing the appropriate solution for our investors through separate accounts or a fund of one.





	Our philosophy of creating partnerships with our investors is exhibited daily in our devotion to first class client service and true transparency.




At Greywolf, the collective expertise of the entire organization is more powerful than any one individual. Our accomplished research team draws on the experience gained and networks developed while working at some of the largest and most reputable investment banks. The average tenure at Greywolf for investment professionals is over ten years and spans a variety of market cycles. Greywolf is a truly collaborative environment with a culture focused on integrity and mutual respect.


	At Greywolf the team is much more importantthan any one individual.
