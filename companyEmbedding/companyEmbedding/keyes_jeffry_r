Roman Journey comes to an end



		6/16/2017
	



		1 Comment
	


 

It was a fitting end to this Roman Pilgrimage. Friday's Mass was a votive of the Passion of the Lord. Then the two companions for the Journey, Fr. Uy and Fr. Carter arrived and we were picked up by our driver, Andrea.  A little over two hours later we were on the other side of Italy and approaching Lanciano, the home of the first Eucharistic miracle in the 9th century.  The three of us spent a bit over an hour in prayer before the Eucharist, and then it was time for lunch. After pranzo we headed for Manoppello.  Again it was time for prayer.  It was really a blessed day.Today will be a day of packing and preparation for the Journey to the States which begins very early tomorrow morning. Pray that I can get to St. Paul without a hitch or delay.

The Day started early.  The Catholic Traveler had asked me to celebrate Mass at St. Peter for some English speaking pilgrims.  This was followed by a little Italian breakfast with Fr. Carter.  Then I was off to the day.  There were two things I had left to accomplish:  a visit to Santa Croce and a marvelous pranzo at Dino and Tony's.  On the way home I picked up some clerical items at Mancinelli's and that was followed by a solemn high nap.

A restful day on Wednesday after all the walking on Tuesday. Walked over to Piazza Navona by way of Via dei Coronari, snapped a picture of a Fountain that St. Gaspar would have ministered near when it was in the Piazza Montanara. Then visited San Agostino, there discovered a beautiful Madonna.  There was a B&W picture there of St. John XXIII kissing that same statue. Caravaggio's painting of the Madonna of Loreto was also in this church. Started my rosary in the chapel of St. Monica, visited St. Agnes again, and then finished my rosary at the chapel of the Madonna del la Pace. Then had a marvelous pranzo with Matt Pearson, a seminarian from Wisconsin. Lunch last about four hours: marvelous conversation

Tuesday Morning, Up, shower and shave, Lauds, decide to say Mass in the afternoon. Spent the day among to martyrs, more than 3000 of them, You need to discover the story of St. Prassede and St, Pudenziana.  Their two churches speak of the witness of thousands of martyrs. There is a spot in the center aisle of Santa Prassede that is a sepulcher of relics of these sacred martyrs,  The chapel where the pillar of the flagellation is kept is always an inspiration, The images of St. Prassede  with St. Paul's arm around her is a beauty. Then I walk a couple of blocks to Santa Pudenziana.  It is not the same beauty as Santa Prassede, but it is built over the house of the Roman Senator, Pudens.  The painting depicts his baptism by St. Peter, but you can also see and touch the font where this happened. Then I visited St. Mary Major again before heading down Via Merulana.  Stoped first at the Church of St. Alphonsus to see the image of the Perpetual Help.  Then stopped in the Church of Sts. Marcelinus and Peter to pray before their relics.  Then I went to St. John Lateran, prayed before the tomb of Leo XIII.  After I returned to the Bordo where I had a marvelous pranzo with Fr. Patrick Resen.  On the way home ran into two Angelinos who were a marvelous conversation, especially as we talked about Eucharistic Miracles. After Mass I ended the day with sung Vespers at Santa Trinitas followed by drinks with Fr.  Carter.

Monday Morning Mass, Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce and then out to the distant Basilica of San Lorenzo, visiting his tomb along with St. Steven, and St. Justin Martyr. There is also the tomb of Blessed Pius IX. Some time in the ancient Cloister, and then out to the memorial of the visit of Pope Pius XII to this area right after it had been bombed by the Allies. Then I went over to Santa Maria della Victoria to visit the Ecstasy by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1652.  From there walked about a mile and a half over to St. Ignatius, the most beautiful ceiling in the world.  That Church also has the tomb of St. Robert Bellermine.  Then off to pranzo at La Pigna. From there a visit to Gamarrelli and then home for a little nap. Light cena then to bed early.  Could not post this in a timely manner as the internet has been dead for about 24 hours.  Finally up and running and Tuesday afternoon I can post about Monday.  Tuesday will be posted a little later.

Restful Day:  Early morning Mass, Matins, Lauds, Prime, Breakfast.  Then over to SS. Trinita dei Pellegrini to meet Fr. Carter.  After Mass we had a marvelous pranzo.  One of the things I noticed about the Mass, as I arrived toward the end, was that the church was packed, standing room only.  After Pranzo visited a friend at La Botticella where I tasted some Trappist beer, then headed home for a nap.  Then Cena with Taylor Marshall and his son, Gabriel.  All in all a restful day with a lot of walking, 10,372 steps today.

                                Dr. Keyes and his staff (especially Kimberley) are amazing. Dr. Keyes did my rhinoplasty and breast augmentation about 9 months ago, and he did exactly what we discussed. He is a fantastic surgeon as well as an overall nice person. I have a nose that fits my face and actually looks more natural than my previous nose.  Dr. Keyes successfully fixed my nose so I still look like me, only better. My breasts are natural, symmetric and perfect for my body type. 
                                -Kris S.






                            I had my breast augmentation from Dr. Keyes 18 years ago ( yes 18 years!) He is an absolute expert in this area.  He and his entire staff were welcoming, professional and kind.  For almost 2 decades, I have been given endless compliments on this part of my appearance.
                            -M.D.






                            I feel great now, when I look in the mirror I see my face not just my nose. I can actually take pictures now without having to worry about my profile.
                            -Anonymous






                            I always have to say I got my nose done, it looks so natural that no one believes it. That’s what I love about it, it looks very natural.
                            -Anonymous
