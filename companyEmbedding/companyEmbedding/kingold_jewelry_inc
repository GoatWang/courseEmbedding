Kingold Jewelry Inc. - Manufacturing - Mon Jul 24, 2017























Manufacturing










Building On A Recognized Brand
As an established brand recognized for premium quality, Kingold relies on a design and production process that consistently delivers the top quality required to fulfill customer expectations. This includes seven proprietary manufacturing techniques and five patented processes to produce its distinctive designs on an industrial scale.

Reshaping Gold On An Industrial Scale
Softer and more difficult to produce than their 14-karat and 18-karat cousins, solid gold jewelry has historically been the domain of artisans and craftspeople.

Our manufacturing process is reshaping that paradigm
In 2009 our state-of-the-art 75,000 square-foot facility produced over 16 tons of premium quality 24-karat gold jewelry, while generating the lowest wastage in the industry.  Capacity can be increased several fold over time with sufficient additional capital and manpower, enabling the company to serve its growing customer base.

A Commitment To World-Class Design
At the heart of Kingold's success is a design program that consistently delivers on customer expectations and evolving consumer needs. 

Our in-house design and R&D teams are responsible for generating 900 new designs each month, relying on an intensive process that includes focus testing and market research to successfully bring new products to market and build the Kingold brand. 

This includes Kingold's strategic partnership with the highly regarded China University of Geosciences. This relationship provides Kingold with exclusive rights to any designs created by its students.

At the heart of Kingold's success is a design program that consistently delivers on customer expectations and evolving consumer needs.

Building According To The Golden Rule  From our world-class production facilities to our uncompromising labor practices, every facet of Kingold's operations reflects a profound commitment to excellence and to building lasting relationships with customers and employees alike.  Those core values have been landmarks of Kingold Founder and CEO Zhihong Jia's entire career-from his military years with the People's Liberation Army where he held a range of senior responsibilities including managing several major goldmines, to founding and building Kingold into a major industry player.  Today, the company and has distinguished itself as a respected brand within an industry characterized by marginal labor practices and inconsistent production quality.  That commitment to integrity and quality will remain a cornerstone of the company's future as Kingold aggressively pursues its strategy of becoming the most dominant player in China's 24-karat gold jewelry market.   Third Quarter 2011 Highlights  Revenue increased 24.2% to $210.7 million from $169.7 million in the third quarter 2010 Gross profit rose 62% to $14 million from $8.6 million in the third quarter 2010 Net income attributable to common stockholders grew 103.5% to $9.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, from $4.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2010 In the third quarter, Kingold started to roll out its investment related gold business across networks within China Merchant Bank as well as Bank of Communication. Kingold completed testing at the end of September of its new e-commerce channel and successfully launched the new initiative in October.   Business Outlook Based on the Company's performance during the first nine months of 2011 and management's current outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company has reassured its full year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of between $800 million and $850 million and net income guidance between $32 million and $34 million. "Our performance in the first nine months of 2011 reinforces our optimism for another year of strong organic growth at Kingold," commented Mr. Jia. "Domestic demand for 24-karat gold products is still robust and we have been well positioned to take advantage of surging consumer demand in China."    Kingold Launches E-Commerce Strategy with M-Gold  Following the successful conclusion of a two month beta Kingold has just launched its new e-commerce business at www.m-gold.com.cn.The new site carries a wide variety of Kingold's higher-end 24 karat gold products which are designed and manufactured in-house at Kingold's facility in Wuhan. Products include jewelry, household ornaments, investment related products such as gold coins and bars, and M-Gold, Kingold's branded line of marriage products; and will target newly affluent customers throughout China."We are excited about launching our internet business and believe that we are the first major jewelry designer and manufacturer to sell 24 karat gold products on-line. This initiative will enable Kingold to take it's beautifully designed and executed products directly to consumers throughout China, many of whom have up till now not had the ability to purchase our products," commented Chairman Jia. "It will also result in far higher margins to Kingold than our traditional business model, where we primarily supply to distributors, not to end-users."E-commerce is growing explosively in China, with over 150 million people shopping online in China today, according to Shanghai-based iResearch. One of the reasons behind this growth is that consumers feel more comfortable shopping online as a result of third-party payment systems such as Alipay, and the increasing acceptance of debit and credit cards."Building our Internet presence is one of the many strategies we are employing in building Kingold into the major national brand of 24 karat gold products in China," continued Chairman Jia. "We expect to announce other initiatives in the near future which will serve to reinforce these efforts and set the basis for our continued expansion."Customers will be able to pay for purchases from the new site both directly, via online banking, and indirectly, through third party payment systems.   Wuhan Rural Commercial Bank Selects Kingold Jewelry to Produce 24K Gold Products  Kingold Jewelry, Inc. ("Kingold") (NASDAQCM: KGJI), one of the leading manufacturers of 24-carat gold jewelry in China, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Wuhan Rural Commercial Bank ("the Bank") for the distribution of Kingold's investment-related products such as gold coins, bars and ornaments. It is anticipated that Kingold's investment-related products will be available for purchase by customers throughout the Bank's network of 230 branches across Wuhan, one of the largest cities in China with a population of approximately 9 million inhabitants."This is the first of what we anticipate will be a series of initiatives with local banks across China to target increasingly affluent suburban residents, who are not typically served by the larger national banks," commented Chairman Jia. "This push into suburban China is complementary to our existing relationships with two of China's largest national banks, China Merchants Bank and the Bank of Communications, who are currently rolling out our investment products across their network of over 3,000 branches. We anticipate that Kingold's investment related business will start to significantly impact revenues by the end of this year, and become a meaningful contributor in 2012."

Net Sales Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $390.5 million, an increase of $126.7 million, or 48.1%, from net sales of $263.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net sales increased primarily as a result of increase in total sales volume in amount of $84.7 million, the increase in the average unit selling price for branded production in amount of $63.2 million, offset by approximately $17.1 million of foreign currency translation loss.
Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,063 million, an increase of $343.6 million, or 47.8%, from net sales of $719.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by increase in total sales volume in amount of $308.9 million, the increase in the average unit selling price for branded production in amount of $91.5 million, partially offset the decreased sales in customized production, and offset by approximately a $45.9 million foreign currency translation loss.
Gross Profit  Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $50.4 million, an increase of $34.9 million from $15.6 million for the same period in 2015. 
Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $125.0 million, an increase of $96.2 million from $28.8 million for the same period in 2015.
Gross Margin Gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 12.9%, compared to 5.9% for the same period in 2015. The substantial increase in gross margin was because: 1) the unit price of branded production sales increased from RMB 206.7 per gram for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 257.1 per gram in the same period of 2016; 2) the percentage increase of the unit price is smaller than the increase in the sales as the unit cost of branded production increased from RMB 197.2 per gram for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 227.6 per gram in the same period in 2016; 3) the Company purchased a significant quantity of gold in prior periods at relatively low prices, making the production costs for three months ended September 30, 2016 much lower than normal.
Gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 11.8%, compared to 4.0% for the same period in 2015. The substantial increase in gross margin was because: 1) the unit price of branded production sales increased from RMB 212.5 per gram for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 240.3 per gram in the same period of 2016; 2) the percentage increase of the unit price is smaller than the increase in the sales as the unit cost of branded production increased from RMB 209.2 per gram for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to RMB 215.3 per gram in the same period in 2016; 3) the Company purchased a significant quantity of gold in prior periods at relatively low prices, making the production costs for nine months ended September 30, 2016 much lower than normal.
Net Income For the three months ended September 30, 2016, net income increased 79.3% to $15.7 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, based on 66.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2015, or $0.13 per diluted share, based on 66.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the prior-year period.
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 218.9% to $50.7 million, or $0.76 per diluted share based on 66.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, compared to $15.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, based on 66.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the same period of 2015.

Net cash used in operating activities was $726.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $34.0 million for the same period in 2015. The significant increase in net cash used in operating was mainly due to purchase of inventory of $817.8 million in anticipation of the increased production and sales demand when the Jewelry Park is completed which may stimulate Kingold's sales starting from the second half 2016. In addition, in connection with the Company's significant bank borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was required to pledge significant of gold with the banks as collateral, which also led the Company to increase the inventory purchases and stockpile. On the other hand, in connection with the Jewelry Park Transfer Contract, the Company received net proceeds of $151.4 million cash payment from Wuhan Lianfuda for the Jewelry Park transfer, such amount will be adjusted when the Company delivers the Jewelry Park to Wuhan Lianfuda in the near future. The overall increase in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflected in the above mentioned factors.  
Kingold's net cash from operating activities can fluctuate significantly due to changes in inventories (principally gold).  Other factors that may vary significantly include the Company's purchases of gold and income taxes.  The Company expects that the net cash it generates from operating activities will continue to fluctuate as the Company's inventories, receivables, accounts payables, and other factors described above change with increased production and purchase of larger quantities of raw materials (principally gold).
OUTLOOK FOR 2016Based on 2016 first nine months results, its existing resources and capacity (which includes the Company's recent proceeds from its previously announced financing and gold lease agreements) along with strong demand for 24-karat gold products in China, the Company raised its guidance for gold processed during 2016 from between 50 metric tons and 60 metric tons to between 60 metric tons and 65 metric tons.
