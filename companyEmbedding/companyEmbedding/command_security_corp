All you gotta do is do your job and go home. I love the benefits they have and they are fully paid I have 401k and PTO and vacation time. I guess everybody has their own opinion on companies cause no company is perfect just how you look at it. My check is always right and the overtime is there if you want to do it. The contract I'm on is under the union so we get raises every year my pay went up a lot. Also the employees are great to work with. So if you at a good paying site this company is not bad at all.ProsPaid lunches, Fully paid benefits, pay raises, quick advancementConsNoneWas this review helpful?Yes No Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureEverything is fineSecurity Officer (Current Employee) –  FedEX, Tinicum – July 25, 2017It's alright, the only problem with the company, no have benefitsConsNo benefitsWas this review helpful?Yes No Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureFunny BusinessSecurity Guard (Former Employee) –  New York, NY – July 24, 2017If Command Security Corp. doesn't have a union just avoid it all together.

They overpay people who ain't worth nothing & underpay the ones who willing to do everything asked. They give management positions to people who know nothing about respecting the employees. They will fire you for their own personal reasons. They definitely show favoritism & show several signs of racism. Management are womanizers. How do you work at a corporate office and the CEO's of the company never talk to you. The insurance is trash. The men are getting promoted & the women are barely getting a raise. I would never work for this company again.ProsFree snacksConsBad healthcare, Unprofessional Management, UnderpaidWas this review helpful?Yes 2No 1Report Job Work/Life BalanceCompensation/BenefitsJob Security/AdvancementManagementJob CultureThis place is a small company run by young peopleSupervising Security Officer (Former Employee) –  East Point, GA – June 29, 2017I worked at Command for a year and through that year, I have witnessed good people leave due to lack of management communications, pay decreases, constant schedule changes and account managers are inexperienced.

Outsmart Burglars  the Moment You Plug It In





“I built SimpliSafe to make home security simpler and smarter. It uses advanced wireless technology, there’s no annual contracts, and it saves you hundreds. I’m proud of that.”
Chad Laurans, CEO & Chief Engineer

After his friends were robbed, Chad Laurans discovered a serious problem in the home security industry. You want your home to be safe, but alarm companies charge huge fees of $45 a month and lock you in long-term contracts. The demands are just too high.
So Chad Built Something New.
Relying on his electrical engineering degree from Yale and an MBA from Harvard, he designed an advanced home security system. He called it SimpliSafe.
Now it’s the fastest growing home security company in the nation. SimpliSafe won’t lock you in a long-term contract and 24/7 professional monitoring is only $14.99 a month.
Protect your home—the smart way. 










Award-Winning Home Security
Winner of CNET Editor’s Choice Award, Angie’s List Super Service Award, and A+ Rated by the Better Business Bureau.








Dave Ramsey, Personal Finance Expert:
“Protecting your family is important, but don’t ever sign a long-term contract. Do it the right way with SimpliSafe. These are the good guys!”





Joe Balog, Police Chief:
"My force used SimpliSafe to stop a serial burglary ring. It still helps us catch other criminals in the act today."





Unlike SimpliSafe, most burglar alarms are far too expensive, here’s why...



With so many people making a profit, they need to use sneaky tactics to extract money from you

They bait you with a “$99” offer though there’s typically $1,500 of hidden fees beneath the hood.
They lock you into 2-3 year contracts that contain fine print such as auto-renewal clauses. (Click to find out why the Government is considering making them illegal).
Their alarms use old wired technology and they’re hard to use (so you need to pay a service engineer for even the most straightforward task).




At SimpliSafe, There Are No Middlemen.
SimpliSafe has sliced out shady annual contracts, intrusive installations, and costly middlemen. We designed our system from scratch to give you everything you need in a security system plus some exciting bells and whistles. We sell direct to you, online. Our system is easy to self-install, and we pass the savings onto you with excellent equipment pricing and monthly monitoring for just $14.99/month.

 describes SimpliSafe alarms as

Many alarm companies have absolutely huge sneaky hidden fees. They advertise their alarms as being “from $99”, then they get you to sign a contract for over $1,000—and you can’t leave them for at least 3 years. But SimpliSafe alarms have no hidden charges.
We’re so confident you’ll love your SimpliSafe alarm that we’ll let you try it RISK-FREE with an incredible no-risk 60-day money back guarantee. SimpliSafe alarms are reliable, easy to use, have no annual contracts and
                no hidden costs.

9 Things to Avoid When Choosing A Traditional Alarm Company
We listened to all the things you dislike about traditional burglar alarm companies... then fixed them.




Traditional Alarm Company
SimpliSafe: a Better Way






                        Old wired technology. Traditional alarm companies 
                        want to put wires in your walls, because they know 
                        that ripping their wires out is hard and expensive.
                        



                        State-of-the-art 100% wireless technology. We 
                        took micro-chip technology and 
                        developed smarter software to offer you a robust 
                        and reliable security system. With wireless, there 
                        are no holes in your walls.
                        






                        Monitoring is $42.99 a month.
                        



                        Ours is just $14.99 a month. SimpliSafe protects your home 
                        with COPS Monitoring - named BEST MONITORING in the 
                        Industry by the Central Station Alarm Association.
                        





                        The moment you let them put a system into your home, you’re 
                        typically locked into a $1,547 contract with no way out.
                        



                        No annual contracts! Our customers stay with us because of 
                        our excellent product quality and helpful customer support.
                        





                        Auto-renewal clauses grab another $1,547 from you if you don’t 
                        cancel them within 90 days of the end of your three-year term. 
                        Forget to cancel? You’re legally trapped—there’s no way out.
                        




                        No hidden charges, no 
                        commitments, no sneaky tricks.
                        





                        Many frustrated customers (just google “alarm system 
                        complaints” or “alarm contract complaints” and see 
                        for yourself).
                    



                        Growing by word of mouth. See our Facebook fan page.
                        





                        Uses a phone line to connect to the monitoring center. 
                        Burglars sometimes cut phone lines.
                        



                        Uses its built-in and independent cellular connection, which is 
                        5-10 seconds faster, and is uncuttable. No phone line required.
                        





                        Prices are kept high because there are so many 
                        middlemen and salespeople involved.
                        



                        We don’t have expensive salespeople or middlemen. That’s 
                        how we can afford to keep our prices so low.
                        





                        Installation typically costs between $99 and $500. You’ll 
                        need to take a day off of work, while the installer drills 
                        holes in your walls.
                        



                        Set-up is easier than you could ever imagine. No tools 
                        needed, just adhesive pads. The unit actually talks to you 
                        while you’re setting it up. One of our customers purchased a 
                        second system for his daughter’s home and was “looking 
                        forward to the joy of installing it for her.” Watch our

                        easy installation video to see what he means.
                        

                        Does easy set-up mean the system is flimsy or less secure?  
                        No! Quite the opposite. No wires means there’s nothing for 
                        burglars to cut.
                        




                        As soon as you sign up, there’s no going back: 
                        you cannot cancel even if you try.
                        
                    

                        We put our money where our mouth is: you can try us

Nearly One Million Americans TrustSimpliSafe to Protect Them. Here’s Why:



Dennis R.
Amarillo, TX



This morning at 6:45 AM, my phone rang. It was the SimpliSafe operator, telling me that my alarm was going off. I had them call the police and they were there within minutes. The glass in the back door had been broken but the system worked perfectly and the intruders ran away. We only had to replace a small pane of glass.







Greg W.
Clarksville, TN



Our home was burglarized two weeks ago. I purchased a system that night and installed it within the week. Today, the thieves returned and the alarm scared them off. The officers were at my home within minutes. Nothing was taken.  SimpliSafe works.







Lauren B.
Tacoma, WA



We installed our system and within one week, the water sensor placed at our water heater set off the alarm. Sure enough, the T/P valve had opened on our water heater. The monitoring service alerted us in under 60 seconds. No water damage whatsoever! Way to go Simplisafe! Our system paid for itself that day.







Stephanie T.
Toledo, OH



I love my system. It saved us from thousands of dollars in damage when the power went out in our house in Northern Ohio on the coldest day in February (-17°!). The monitoring center alerted us in Florida that the power was out and the temperature in the house was dropping fast. We were able to contact an electrician to repair the problem. Without the system we never would have known and would have had major freeze damage.






SimpliSafe is recommended by ABC, Fox News, NBC & more!





















“No installation, no annual contracts, very smart.”






“Everything is included, and it’s portable so if you change apartments, you can just bring it with you.”






“David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe vs ADT: 
                SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger 
                rivals by giving consumers what they really
                 want. Even without fancy marketing, word 
                 is spreading.”  see review








SimpliSafe is not for you if...


1
You have a HUGE home: If your home is larger than 20,000 
            square feet (about the size of a football field)—or if it has more 
            than 50 windows on the first floor—you would probably benefit 
            from a system that can handle a huge number of sensors. Our 
            advice would be to go to a traditional contract security company
            —and keep in mind the things we’ve warned you about.


2
You run a large commercial property such as a 
            shopping mall—you would probably benefit from a 
            system that has CCTV or security guards, in which 
            case you should probably go to one of the traditional 
            contract security companies—and keep in mind the 
            things we’ve warned you about.



However, if you’re one of the 95% of people who don’t run a large commercial property, then SimpliSafe is probably the best
            choice for you. If you’re in any doubt, contact one of our security consultants at 1-888-957-4675 for free friendly advice.

				Feel Safe. Save Energy.

				with Nest.
			

				SimpliSafe helps the Nest Thermostat learn when you’re home 
				or away to make saving energy even simpler.
				When you arm SimpliSafe to leave home, 
				SimpliSafe tells Nest Thermostat, so Nest 
				Thermostat knows it’s time to lower your energy 
				use. When you come home and disarm SimpliSafe, 
				Nest Thermostat knows you’re back and makes 
				home cozy. Saving energy just got simpler.

Family, guests, roommates, kids: our houses are full of people getting into places they don’t always belong. Secret Alerts give you the power to know everything that happens at home—like your own private eye.
These alert-only sensors tell you when a sensor is activated, without triggering an alarm. So you can secretly keep an eye on your closets, safes, private drawers, liquor cabinets and more!
Imagine if someone opened your gun safe without your knowledge or permission. Secret Alerts ensure that you always know the hidden activity in your home.







This Incredibly Easy DIY Set-Up Saves You Hundreds!



Most alarm companies make set-up complicated so they can force you to pay outrageous installation fees. With SimpliSafe there are NO expensive set-up fees, NO complicated wiring, and NO strangers drilling holes in your walls!



				Sleek wireless alarms are so easy to install, anyone can do it! And it will look so good that your neighbors will think you spent hundreds!
			

				All your sensors arrive pre-programmed, batteries installed & adhesive strips ready-mounted—so you can arm your home against intruders in under an hour.
			






Most Alarms Have Two Dangerous Defects—SimpliSafe Doesn’t
Learn the Two Powerful Secrets for Stopping Intruders In Their Tracks:
				Most wireless alarm systems have a dangerous defect—if an intruder smashes the Keypad quickly enough, the police don’t get alerted. SimpliSafe has solved this problem: we took the brains of your system out of your keypad, and hid them in your Base Station.

SimpliSafe is There...Even When the Lights Go Out


Never fear a power outage or electricity failure again. SimpliSafe runs on powerful lithium batteries that last 5 years—so you stay secure when the electricity fails. Plus, the Base Station comes equipped with a built-in rechargeable backup battery, which can power your system for 24 hours and be recharged at any time.


Customer Review: Donald Meehan
“I have had my system for about 6 weeks now my wife and I love it. We just lost power for four days, I took the base to my in-laws and recharged it twice. It worked great during the power outage. I spoke to some neighbors who have also recently got alarms with other companies, they were very upset because their system died pretty quickly and were not able to recharge it.”









You’ll Save Up to 20% on Home Insurance With this Certificate


Home insurance companies know the value of professional alarm monitoring. That’s why you will save 5% to 20% on your insurance premiums when your protect your home with SimpliSafe monitoring!
With savings that great, your professional alarm monitoring might even pay for itself. Over 100,000 SimpliSafe customers are saving money on their insurance premiums! These are just a small sample of the insurance companies we work with:













Firefighters Straight to your Door


When a fire is burning in your home every second counts. SimpliSafe smoke detectors are built with photoelectric sensors for faster detection of a fire before it breaks into a flame, giving you and your family more time to get up and out of your home. Photoelectric sensors like ours are less likely to trigger annoying false alarms.
Never worry about sleeping through a fire alarm. This monitored detector will sound its own internal siren as well as trigger the full security system alarm.






Our competitor’s model sells for $79.99. Ours is $29.99. How do we sell the highest quality sensors at half the price? No middlemen.






Extreme Range—and Fully Customizable for Your Home





SimpliSafe sensors have a huge range of 400 ft., so our system is perfect for homes and businesses of any size (unless you live in the Superdome).
Some alarm companies make it almost impossible to personalize your alarm for your home. Every SimpliSafe alarm system is 100% customizable to meet your home’s unique needs. Our systems support up to 41 sensors—you can add more at any time via our online security shop or with a quick call to our friendly support team.





Smart Sensors Never Mistake Pets for Burglars


SimpliSafe uses more precise motion sensors to ensure your pets won’t trigger your alarms. Simply place your motion sensors where your pets can’t fiddle with them, and your cats or dogs can comfortably play at home without triggering an alarm.

It’s Easier Than Ever to Test Your Sensors

It’s easy to make sure your pets won’t set off your alarm with SimpliSafe’s unique Test Mode. And our security specialists are available for a consultation if you’re having trouble finding the right position!

Homeowners with big pets love this trick

Normally, the Motion Sensor looks straight out and down towards the ground. If your pet is triggering the sensor, just place it about 4-5 feet above ground level, and turn it upside down! This way, your pet can’t trigger it, but an intruder will!








Moving is Easier than Ever—Fully Portable Alarms





All SimpliSafe Equipment will fit a new home quickly and easily. Moving to a larger place? No problem. Order extra sensors anytime

Simple Re-Installation

We include extra 3M command strips in every box, making it easy for you to move sensors to a new home. These adhesive strips are super strong, but are also engineered to pull off cleanly without damaging your walls.





Total Security— Exceptional Savings



CNET calls SimpliSafe “better, smarter home security...you’ll have a hard time finding a better option at a better price.” Here’s why:
We protect your home 24 hours a day with a state-of-the-art security system, professional alarm monitoring, and instant police dispatch. Your security system is so effective that actual Wisconsin police uses it to catch criminals. We use COPS monitoring—winner of CSAA’s Best-in-Industry Monitoring.
...and it’s only 14.99/month Compare that to the $50/month most other companies charge. That adds up to savings of over $500 every year.

What is an “auto-renewal clause” anyway?
Most alarm companies have an automatic renewal clause in their monitoring and service contract (and use teeny tiny font). This means that your contract will be renewed for anywhere from 12 months to three years, unless you cancel by mail within 30 days before the end of your contract. Many of the nationwide and local alarm companies use this tactic. Cancelling early usually involves a penalty of 75% to 100% of the value of the contract. 

SimpliSafe offers monthly alarm monitoring. There are no contracts to sign, so there’s no fear of getting tricked by fine print and hidden fees. You can cancel your SimpliSafe alarm monitoring anytime by simply giving us a call.

"SimpliSafe security system is inexpensive, transportable..."








"All the bells and whistles for a lot less money"








SimpliSafe is our idea of not getting robbed.








"Some things can keep you tethered to landline service, such as your home's security system. Not so with SimpliSafe Inc."








SimpliSafe was featured in Elle Decor's top punchlist.








"This ingenious security system uses wireless technology..."








I really like the SimpliSafe security system for its easy setup, expandability, custom setup options and ability to move with you if you relocate. I think the price for the system is really affordable when you compare it to other security systems on the market. It gets a thumbs up from me.








SimpliSafe offers wireless, plug-and-play security for urban dwellers—increasingly being used in the era of disappearing land lines.








Wireless Wonders: SimpliSafe is an affordable, but full-featured, wireless security system similar to the expensive, professionally installed ones.








"David vs Goliath, SimpliSafe  vs ADT: SimpliSafe aims to upstage their larger rivals by giving consumers what they really want. Even without fancy marketing, word is spreading."








Security Doesn't Get Any Easier. Setup took less than 15 minutes from start to finish and drastically improved my peace of mind.









Rating: Strong Recommend (the highest rating). "This is a system anyone could setup in under 30 minutes." See full review  
If you've got a car alarm, using the SimpliSafe home security system will come as naturally and easily. 
							All sensor units come prepared with removable adhesive backs (the 3M variety that adheres well, but removes easily).

STOP Security Plates
Part# STP-SP (As low as $8.75 in quantity.)
LAPTOP THEFT PREVENTION AND RECOVERYThieves Won't Steal What They Can't Sell.
A STOP Security Plate is the most cost-effective prevention, anti-theft, recovery, and asset management tag available.  Which is good, because whether your equipment is lost or stolen at the office, airport, or anywhere else, unscheduled replacement is a budget item no one enjoys revisiting.

DESCRIPTION

Effective DeterrenceThe value of your hi-tech equipment also makes it a target. STOP Security Plates significantly reduce the percentage of theft by clearly marking your equipment as an obvious liability for any would-be thief. Our patented system integrates a highly visible security plate. Under that, there's a chemically bonded tattoo, stating "Stolen Property" that even a determined thief can't remove and would find virtually impossible to explain to a potential purchaser.STOP Security Plates retain your property's value while it's under your control, but if ever stolen, the prominently displayed plate and the tattoo underneath completely remove any value on the resale market.



RecoveryThe value of STOP Security Plates goes beyond deterrence. If your equipment is just misplaced, STOP Security Plates are marked with a unique registration number that dramatically increases the incidence of recovery by providing an easy way to do the right thing.If someone finds your lost STOP-plated equipment where it shouldn't be, they simply contact STOP by phone on our 24-hour hotline or connect with us online. STOP will make the necessary arrangements to get your machine back to you quickly.

Protection that WorksWith STOP Security Plates, you'll have peace of mind knowing that the "cost of doing business" no longer includes computer theft and loss.For as little as $8.75 per unit (in quantities of 500 of more), STOP Security Plates:

Prevent theft by eliminating resale market value
Thwart both professional and casual thieves
Create unavoidable obstacles to theft
Discourage unauthorized use
Provide best opportunity for honest return
Link equipment with individual users
Facilitate recovery via our 24-hour toll-free equipment identification hotline
Provide the most cost-effective deterrence, recovery, and lifetime protection on the market!



Theft PreventionMarking or "branding" equipment in an attempt to deter   theft and improve tracking is not a new idea. The way that STOP does it is. And, the remarkable reduction in equipment losses enjoyed by our clients make it an idea worth your time!
Two sizes are available. The standard plate for computers, laptops, tablets, etc. and a smaller plate for cell phones, iPad minis, and smaller equipment.
21⁄2" x 21⁄8"2" x 3⁄4"

The only security plate in the marketAt the heart of the STOP system is our patented security plate.  Made of a tough photo-anodized aluminum, it is affixed to your equipment with cyanoacrylate adhesive so strong that removal of the security plate requires up to 800 pounds of pressure. Removal of the plate will noticeably, physically alter the case.

An indelible tattoo stops professional thievesWe don't stop there, however!  It's our unique, patented installation process that makes the STOP system so unusually effective.  During the simple do-it-yourself installation of each security plate, a permanent tattoo is chemically etched into your equipment, beneath the plate.  If someone succeeds in removing the plate (special tools are required), the indelible marking is exposed.


The unique tattoo presents a bold-type declaration that the object is "Stolen Property" and a toll-free number for verification and anti-theft information. This tattoo cannot be removed by any means without marking or defacing the case, and such a mark is recognized by police and resellers as a telltale sign that the property is stolen.


Professional thieves are not interested in equipment itself, only in its resale value on the open market. STOP's patented security plate and tattoo dramatically reduce theft by reducing the value of stolen equipment to zero.The police traceable plate and sticker deter "casual" theft.  There is more.  Each security plate bears a clear, dissuasive warning message that the property is monitored and police traceable, along with a warning that the tattoo has been etched into the equipment. Each plate also bears a unique barcode linked to the owner's tracking information, and a toll-free telephone number to call in case lost or stolen equipment is found.


Included with the standard size STOP plate is a bright red "Police Identifiable Warning Sticker" we send along for you to apply next to the plate.  Result: the guy who finds your laptop at the airport, or the employee who may have considered permanently "borrowing" an office cell phone - is highly unlikely to do so when it is clear that a 30-second check on the equipment will reveal him to be a criminal.


Marking your equipment with STOP plates makes it clear to all potential thieves that the equipment can never be shown to anyone without great risk of their facing criminal charges.

Equipment RecoverySTOP plates deliver high returns.Attaching a STOP security plate is not only the most important step you   can take in deterring theft. Our plates also connect you to our highly effective international tracking and retrieval service - the service that pushes STOP   security ahead of the rest.Numbers talk.Our return rate for lost property is unusually high.  We have successfully returned 9 out of every 10 items reported lost for the more than 2,000 companies that use the STOP system worldwide.  Given that our typical client has spent $4000 per laptop, before including the value of software, data and time spent inputting data into the machine, STOP's high reduction in losses results in significant savings!How does it work?Each STOP security plate bears a unique identifying number, along with the toll-free number for our anti-theft and ownership verification hotline.  STOP's worldwide registry links the plate i.d. number to the make, model, serial number and owner of the equipment it's affixed to.  A call to the toll-free number thus yields quick and easy ownership   verification.Our full service recovery system means you can finally relax.Misplaced computers represent more than 60 percent of lost equipment and   our service is extremely effective in returning these valuables to you.  Should you misplace your laptop, etc., experience has shown it is very likely that a fellow traveler or commuter, a service center, or whoever finds it -- will call our 800 hotline.Immediately after we've received a call locating your lost equipment, we call you to let you know where your machine is.  But we don't stop there:

We take care of returning all recovered property!Our retrieval service includes overseeing the return of your valuable   equipment - another headache you won't be suffering through once you register with STOP.


"Hot" property is returned, not resold.In any case of suspected theft, STOP will help you register the loss with local police and the FBI. We will also list the loss with INTERPOL in France, and throughout our own expanded international security network.


When the stolen equipment is offered for sale (the goal in most instances of theft), potential buyers, resellers, or whoever comes across it - typically become suspicious about the machine due to the warnings on the plate.  They call STOP's clearly marked 800 hotline and we advise them on the spot that the equipment is stolen property.  Resale is prevented and recovery follows quickly.If the computer is taken by a professional thief, who foolishly attempts to remove the security plate, the permanently etched tattoo underneath the plate displays the words "Stolen Property" in bold type, along with the toll-free number connected to our retrieval service.  Resale value for the marked item dwindles to nothing with this marking exposed.  Police and/or potential computer resellers who come across equipment stripped down to our tattoo call the 800 number and our rapid retrieval service is put into motion.  Thus, the safety of keeping or reselling a "hot" computer marked with STOP plates disappears and most are returned via our retrieval service.

Asset TrackingAs effective as STOP's security plates are in theft deterrence, the beauty of the system lies in its ability to track your organization's inventory of equipment while we protect it.  And this complete service pays for itself very quickly.The key is the security plate's barcode.  When used in combination with a hand-held barcode scanner and asset tracking software - tracking and maintaining your inventory become remarkably simple.
