NEW YORK, Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Paxos™, a financial technology company delivering revolutionary blockchain solutions for global financial institutions, today announced the appointment of Duncan L. Niederauer, the former Chief Executive Officer of The New York Stock Exchange, to the company's Board of Directors.








Niederauer joins the company's experienced leadership team, including fellow board members former FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Bair, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, former FASB Chairman Robert H. Herz, and former Chairman, President and CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi.
"Duncan is an exceptional addition to our board and we will benefit from his over 30 years of leadership experience in developing products and building companies in financial services," said Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla. "Duncan has been at the forefront of innovation and transformation in capital markets and will be instrumental as we continue to grow."
"I'm delighted to join the Paxos Board of Directors during a time of evolution within capital markets.

He is co-founder of the Mountain Top Advisory Group, a managing member of 555 Capital, and the non-executive chairman of Scenic Advisement, LLC. He also sits on the boards of First Republic Bank, Realogy Holdings and Colgate University.

		​Former NYSE CEO Duncan L. Niederauer Brings a Wealth of Experience to Paxos Board

Experience is the most invaluable asset when it comes to business. Building an experienced board of directors is essential for a company like Paxos to be successful. Adding the former NYSE CEO Duncan L. Niederauer to its board is an excellent move considering Mr. Niederauer’s track record in business. Just so you know, Paxos is a financial technology company delivering revolutionary blockchain solutions for global financial institutions, meaning its platform will add automation and efficiency to capital markets once a trade has been made. Its flagship product Bankchain provides instant settlement opportunities to post-trade activity thereby reducing risk, lowering capital requirements, and increasing operational efficiencies. "I'm delighted to join the Paxos Board of Directors during a time of evolution within capital markets. Blockchain technology promises to revolutionize post-trade clearing infrastructure and Paxos' Bankchain platform is poised to offer unique market efficiencies and automation for the benefit of all investors. I'm excited to join a team of distinguished board members and work with the Paxos management team," said Duncan Niederauer in a press release. 

  Mr. Niederauer brings more than 30 years of experience to an already impressive Paxos board consisting of former FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Blair; former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley; former FASB Chairman Robert H. Herz; and former Chairman, President, and CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi. We all know of Mr. Niederauer’s most recent exploits as the head of the NYSE, but before that he was a partner at Goldman Sachs, where he worked from 1985 to 2007. He also co-founded the Mountain Top Advisory Group; is a managing member of 555 Capital; the non-executive chairman of Scenic Advisement, LLC; and sits on the boards of First Republic Bank, Realogy Holdings, and Colgate University. The simple sports analogy that comes to mind for this type of addition to the Paxos team is when the Denver Broncos added Peyton Manning to its roster a few years ago. I’m not sure if Mr. Niederauer can throw a spiral like Peyton, but I know he can offer Paxos some invaluable direction for their business. One Super Bowl trophy, another Super Bowl appearance, and a league MVP certainly justify the Denver Broncos return on investment in Peyton Manning, but the real similarity I see between the sports icon and the business mogul are their respective leadership skillsets. As you can see from his resume above, Mr. Niederauer is a respected member of the world business community and Paxos is very luck to have him on its board of directors.Sign up for our Free Newsletter

Duncan Niederauer Joins Fantex Holdings' Board Of Directors






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2015 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Fantex Holdings, Inc. (Fantex Holdings) announced today that Wall Street veteran Duncan L. Niederauer - former CEO of The New York Stock Exchange - has joined its board of directors.  "Duncan is a true Wall Street pioneer, and we are excited to welcome him to our board," said Fantex Holdings' Chairman and co-founder David M. Beirne. "We believe his unique experience - especially in identifying, developing and giving access to new asset classes - will be extraordinarily valuable as our subsidiary Fantex, Inc. continues to acquire cash flows from athlete brands."  Mr. Niederauer joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2007. As CEO, Mr. Niederauer led the transformation of the NYSE into a resurgent, high-tech marketplace with a global focus. Prior to joining the NYSE, Mr. Niederauer spent 22 years with Goldman, Sachs & Co., ultimately serving as Managing Director & Co-Head of Equities Execution Services.  "Much of my career has been focused on providing broad access to new and innovative investments.

"I'm honored to join the Fantex Holdings board, where I can combine my passion for financial innovation with my passion for sports and entertainment."  About Fantex  Based in San Francisco, Fantex Holdings serves as the parent company to both Fantex, Inc. and Fantex Brokerage Services, LLC. Fantex, Inc., is a brand building company that purchases a minority interest in earnings from an athlete's brand and works with athletes to increase the value of their brand.

Duncan L. Niederauer ’81 helps Class of 2013 graduates bask in glow of No. 13 Tim O'KeeffeMay 19, 2013News and Updates2 Comments 0

The No. 13 was front and center at today’s commencement exercise as members of the Class of 2013 were celebrated for their achievements and their unique link to the number that is part of university lore.
Commencement speaker Duncan L. Niederauer ’81, chief executive officer of NYSE Euronext, congratulated the 685 graduating seniors and shared what he called his “13 for 13,” which were powerful prescriptions for success.
“This could be the start of something big; it is going to be what you make of it,” he told the graduates assembled in Sanford Field House. “Fasten your seat belts. No one is going to give you an instruction manual; but great news, your generation doesn’t need one. Nothing you buy any more comes with an instruction manual.”

Niederauer gave voice to what he called the power of the American dream and how that concept thrives today.
He shared a story of how Snoop Dogg (a k a Snoop Lion), the rapper, actor, and entrepreneur, was invited to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange a couple years back.
Another entrepreneur asked Snoop Dogg if he had ever dreamed of being invited to Wall Street for such an occasion, and all Snoop Dogg said was, “Why not?”
That epitomizes the American dream, said Niederauer, who said he was the product of that same dream.
“This is the land of opportunity. Find me another country in the world where the son of immigrants can become the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange three quarters of a century later. It is something to be proud of.”

Niederauer said he was able to come to Colgate in 1976 through the hard work of his parents and the financial aid he received through the generosity of those who came before him.
His first job after Colgate, running a restaurant in Atlanta, was thanks to an alumnus. His first foray into the financial world, a job at Goldman Sachs, where he would spend 22 years, was made possible through the efforts of another alumnus.
“Keep Colgate close to you,” he told the graduates.
In summarizing his “13 for 13,” Niederauer said:

“Pay more attention to your self worth than your net worth. Spend time with people who tell you what you can do not what you can’t do. Dare to do great things and hold yourself accountable to make a difference in the lives of others. Participate, don’t spectate, and have the feelings of victory and defeat, it will make you a stronger person.”
Niederauer said the No. 13 resonates in a variety of ways for him and his family. He and his wife, Alison, are leading the effort to build a new school in New Jersey for students with autism and other special needs.
Many people told Niederauer the project was too ambitious and that it couldn’t happen. He said it will happen, and the opening of the expanded Newmark School will be held on, of all days, Friday the 13th — Sept. 13, 2013.
“Why not?” he asked in closing his speech to thunderous applause from the crowd.
Niederauer received an honorary degree at today’s ceremony, as did baccalaureate speaker The Very Reverend Dr. Jane Shaw, dean of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco; Jeff Fager ’77 P’06, chairman of CBS News and executive producer of 60 Minutes;Jill Lepore, David Woods Kemper Professor of American history at Harvard University and staff writer for The New Yorker; and Hamdi Ulukaya, CEO, founder, and president of Chobani.

Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, New York and Paris 

April 21, 2010 


NYSE Euronext, Listed Companies and Partner Organizations Highlight Financial Literacy Initiatives At Exchanges Worldwide 


Underscoring its ongoing commitment to enhance financial literacy, NYSE Euronext (NYX) will kick off its inaugural Financial Literacy Week on April 26 with a week-long series of partnership events and bell ringing ceremonies globally that highlight initiatives to help improve consumers’ financial capabilities. 

April is Financial Literacy Month, and to mark Financial Literacy Week during April 26-30, NYSE Euronext is dedicating its exchange locations and bell ringing ceremonies worldwide to promote initiatives by NYSE-listed companies, partner organizations and individuals that enhance personal finance and money management capabilities. 

“Empowering consumers with knowledge about saving, borrowing and spending is a top priority at NYSE Euronext, especially in today’s fragile economy,” said Duncan Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. 
“Through our network of listed companies and partner organizations, we can drive efforts to enhance the workforce’s understanding of key financial concepts and the importance of being fiscally aware in the increasingly complex global marketplace.” 


In New York 


In New York , NYSE Euronext will kick off Financial Literacy Week by ringing the NYSE Opening Bell commemorating the recent launch of NYSEmoneysense.com, an online financial education resource.

For the remainder of the week, NYSE listed-companies will be recognized for their leadership role to improve the nation’s financial capabilities. 

Listed company bell ringers include:

Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and its successful Money Matters: Make it CountSM financial literacy program, co-sponsored by Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Charles Schwab Foundation; 

Visa (NYSE: V) and practicalmoneyskills.com; 

the Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG) and AmericaRebuilds.com; 

Viacom (NYSE: VIA) and Get Schooled; 

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Biz-Kids$; 

the McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP) and Financial Literacy Now; 

U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and Operation Hope, a leading non-profit public benefit organization dedicated to eradicating poverty; 

and MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET) and Financial Literacy For Our Children. 

Joining the bell ringers will be the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents 100 of the largest integrated financial services companies providing banking, insurance, and investment products and services. 

Ending the week will be the U.S. Treasury and the "Financial Literacy Challenge", an online exam for high school students. 


In Europe 


In Europe, NYSE Euronext will dedicate its exchange locations to financial literacy initiatives with local European partner organizations, constituents and public policy makers visiting respective NYSE Euronext exchanges. 

In France , NYSE Euronext will welcome Infopro Communications, the owner of Quorum Expo, to its Paris market to promote its "Actionaria" annual flagship conference, bringing together exchange clients and experts to promote a better understanding of investing.

In Belgium , Jean-Paul Servais, chairman of the Belgian regulator, the CBFA, will open the market on April 26. 

In Portugal , António de Sousa, President of the Portuguese Banking Association will ring the closing bell on April 28. 
The Portuguese Banking Association (APB) owns the Portuguese Bank Training Institute (IFB), with its School of Bank Management (ISGB), that provides ongoing training and specialized higher education on financial literacy. 
Its mission is to strengthen the culture of the profession and support the development of the Portuguese financial sector by improving its workers’ qualifications. 

Each bell ringing ceremony will be announced separately, along with details about the individual financial literacy project being highlighted. 


NYSE Euronext and Financial Literacy: 


NYSE Money Sense 

On April 1, in conjunction with National Financial Literacy Month, NYSE Euronext launched NYSE Money Sense, a new online educational resource for consumers to improve their money-management skills and knowledge. 
As part of its collaboration with listed companies, NYSE-listed companies are distributing NYSE Money Sense content to their employees, offering links to the NYSE Money Sense site on their internal networks. 

For NYSE Euronext, financial literacy is a key priority, as it works with listed companies and partner organizations to dedicate resources and expertise to develop and make high quality financial education resources available to the employees of its listed companies and consumers. 

NYSE Money Sense encompasses a wide spectrum of personal-finance topics, connecting consumers with a variety of leading sources and experts in the financial industry to provide insights on topics ranging across five category umbrellas: Earn, Spend, Save, Borrow and Protect.

The annual Teachers Workshop covers the capital-raising process and the NYSE’s market system, technology, and regulation and surveillance. 
The program includes speakers from NYSE Euronext and the trading community and features lecture-discussion sessions, hands-on activities, and field trips, including a visit to the trading floor, where teachers are given the opportunity to interact with market professionals. 

Four Teacher Workshops will be offered this summer at the New York Stock Exchange.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
