Clearlake Capital Acquires That’s How We Roll, LLC, Maker of Premium Branded Snack Offerings Mrs. Thinsters and Dippin’ Chips
Investment Made Through Clearlake’s Better For You Holdings Platform, in Conjunction with That’s How We Roll Founder Aldo Zuppichini
Santa Monica, CA March 21, 2016 – Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. (together with its affiliates, “Clearlake”) announced that it has acquired That’s How We Roll, LLC (“THWR” or the “Company”), a leading provider of high quality, branded, better-for-you snacks in North America, including flagship brands Mrs. Thinsters and Dippin’ Chips. The acquisition was completed as part of Clearlake’s recently announced Better For You Holdings platform. Transaction terms were not announced.
Clearlake is partnering with THWR founder and CEO Aldo Zuppichini, who maintains a significant equity stake in the Company. Zuppichini is an industry veteran who was on the founding team of Pretzel Crisps and also served as National Sales Manager before its parent company, Snack Factory, was sold to Snyder’s-Lance. He was also a founding member of NY Style Bagel Chips, growing U.S. sales significantly as National Sales Manager before its successful sale to Nabisco. THWR will remain based in Fairfield, NJ, and will continue to be led by Zuppichini and its team of seasoned professionals, including Senior Vice President of Marketing and Operations Sam Kestenbaum, and Vice President of Sales Amy Kiley.
“We are excited to partner with Aldo, Sammy, Amy, and the rest of the team at That’s How We Roll and to continue supporting the Company’s growth as they strive to meet the demands of today’s health conscious, perceptive consumers,” said José Feliciano and Behdad Eghbali, Co-Founders and Managing Partners of Clearlake. “With better for you snacks that include options such as non-GMO and gluten free in a variety of delicious flavors, we believe Dippin’ Chips and Mrs. Thinsters are well-positioned to attract consumers looking to make healthier lifestyle choices.”
“Clearlake’s partnership will allow us to extend our resources for product innovation, accelerate nationwide distribution, and provide consumers with more premium healthy snack options without sacrificing taste,” said Zuppichini. “We are very excited about the future, and our team looks forward to continued growth.”
Arta Tabaee, a Principal at Clearlake, added, “Aldo and the team have fantastic retail relationships, consumer insights, supply chain capabilities and, most importantly, energy and passion, which are necessary to building a leading platform in this fast-growing category. We look forward to continuing to sponsor THWR’s position as an innovator in this highly dynamic space, and are pursuing additional investments as part of our Better For You portfolio.”
That’s How We Roll offers consumers better-for-you, premium snack options that are certified non-GMO and MSG-free under two premier brands: Mrs. Thinsters and Dippin Chips. Mrs. Thinsters are low-calorie, thin, crispy, and deliciously crunchy cookies available in a variety of flavors including Cake Batter, Chocolate Chip, Brownie Batter, Original Waffle Crisps, Pumpkin Spice, and the recently introduced Toasted Coconut. Mrs. Thinsters cookies are non-GMO, made with simple ingredients found in any kitchen, and do not include corn syrup or any artificial ingredients. Dippin’ Chips are uniquely designed dippable tortilla chips offered in a variety of delicious flavors like Veggie, Fiesta Bean, Super Grain, Original Sea Salt, and Blue Corn. Dippin’ Chips are certified gluten-free and use non-GMO ingredients. These products are available in over 10,000 grocery, club and mass locations across North America.

Clearlake Capital Acquires Chip, Cookie Brands Of That’s How We Roll
Candy & Snack Today | Industry

21 Mar 2016
|
by Candy & Snack TODAY












Santa Monica, CA — Private investment firm Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. has acquired That’s How We Roll, LLC (THWR), marketers and distributors of Dippin Chips and Mrs. Thinsters brands. 
Aldo Zuppichini, founder and CEO of THWR, will partner with Clearlake Capital bringing his expertise in the snack industry as a founding team member of Snack Factory, LLC Pretzel Crisps brand before it was sold to Snyder’s-Lance. The company also says he grew sales “significantly” as national sales manager and founding member of NY Style Bagel Chips before its sale to Nabisco, Inc. 
Zuppichini will continue to lead the THWR team out of New Jersey as the company’s services also serve to expand Clearlake Capital’s offerings in “better for you” snacks.  
“Clearlake’s partnership will allow us to extend our resources for product innovation, accelerate nationwide distribution, and provide consumers with more premium healthy snack options without sacrificing taste,” says José Feliciano, co-founder and managing partners of Clearlake. “With better for you snacks that include options such as non-GMO and gluten free in a variety of delicious flavors, we believe Dippin’ Chips and Mrs. Thinsters are well-positioned to attract consumers looking to make healthier lifestyle choices.”
The company offers low-calorie, thin and crispy cookies under the Thinsters brand in a range of flavors including cake batter, chocolate chip, brownie batter and original waffle crisps. THWR also offers Dippin’ Chips, tortilla chips designed for scooping, in a number of varieties such as veggie, fiesta bean, super grain and original sea salt. 
Arta Tabaee, a principal at Clearlake, adds: “The team has fantastic retail relationships, consumer insights, supply chain capabilities and, most importantly, energy and passion, which are necessary to building a leading platform in this fast-growing category.”
