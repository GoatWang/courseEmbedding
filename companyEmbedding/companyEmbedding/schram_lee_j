Also, part of that heritage of calcification includes a very competitive, us-vs.-them mentality between departments, which makes multi-team projects across various departments rather difficult.Advice to ManagementKeep moving in the direction of inclusivity and recognizing the important of multi-departmental cooperation.

Large, well-maintained parking lotConsDeluxe has resorted to publicly humiliating struggling employees in a centrally located "Pod", where everyone walks by. It's basically where they send you before they fire you. Deluxe coaches are now telling sales employees to be aggressive and to make the customer feel guilty if they do not place an order. Sales goals are becoming increasingly difficult, and expectations are becoming unreasonable.Deluxe used to have a rewards-based, positive culture, but has shifted radically to a pressure and fear-based culture. A new site leader was brought on at one of the sites in Minnesota, and his background is debt collection. Keep in mind he is now in charge of a sales center, and he has sent out many threatening emails telling us that he "doesn't do nice", and how we've received our "fair warning".Employees are told that they are replaceable and they will find someone else sitting at their desk if they do not perform at the constantly increasing standards.It's no surprise that attrition is out-of-control at Deluxe.They used to have a cafeteria with freshly-prepared meals to order, and a great salad bar, and have closed it. Deluxe does not feel that it's employees deserve a decent, affordable meal.The high stress has caused some employees to develop stress-related medical conditions. No job is worth sacrificing your health for.The promise of advancement is an illusion. What Deluxe calls a promotion often means more responsibility at the same rate of pay.Stay away, you can find a company who respects and values it's people. Deluxe is borderline unethical in it's treatment of it's employees. Deluxe has created the most toxic work environment I have ever been in.Advice to ManagementIt's not too late to fix this, but it ALL has to change. The fear and threats need to go.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-07-11 07:44 PDT Jun 15, 2017"Customer service/Sales"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Customer Service Representative in Colorado Springs, COFormer Employee - Customer Service Representative in Colorado Springs, CORecommendsPositive OutlookI worked at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat benefits , good working conditions . career opportunities , job securityConsdifficult to feel part of the team, low salaryAdvice to ManagementDon't be so aloof from the employees, get off the pedestal, and encourage others for advancementShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-06-15 06:21 PDT Jul 1, 2017"Deluxe"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Software Developer in Boca Raton, FLFormer Employee - Software Developer in Boca Raton, FLDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than a year)ProsThe place is decorated well .

I've seen managers talk about things, one will ask the other a yes/no question and the other manager will just flat refuse to take a side on the issue for fear of the consequences. This rarely makes it below management but it's got to be killing the managers and will ultimately trickle down.Advice to ManagementIt's better to stand up to the people above you and look for a new job than it is to be spineless and shift blame constantly. That's the only advice I could give, if anyone bothered to do this it wouldn't take long to fix long standing issues.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Deluxe Corporation Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Deluxe Corporation 2017-05-31 13:23 PDT Jun 22, 2017 Helpful (1)"The Worst Place To Work"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - SMB Account Manager in Draper, UTFormer Employee - SMB Account Manager in Draper, UTDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Deluxe Corporation full-time (More than a year)ProsI was able to get experience in PPC.Cons- The made countless promised to me that they couldn't keep.

Timeless Lee Jeans for Women
Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
