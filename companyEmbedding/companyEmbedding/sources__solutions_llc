Single Source for all Alternatives
Comprehensive selection of new and refurbished networking, system, and component products across every major OEM brand, means you won’t have to call multiple suppliers with various levels of quality and support.

Sourcing Solutions LLC guarantees that Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware products are free from defects in materials or workmanship under normal use during the Limited Warranty Period. The Limited Warranty Period starts on the date of product delivery and lasts for 1 year. Your dated sales or delivery receipt, showing the date of purchase or lease of the product, is your proof of purchase. You may be required to provide proof of purchase as a condition of receiving warranty service. You are entitled to hardware warranty service according to the terms and conditions of this document if a repair to your Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware product is required within the Limited Warranty Period.
During the Limited Warranty Period, Sourcing Solutions LLC will, at its discretion, repair or replace any defective hardware product. All component parts or hardware products removed under this Limited Warranty become the property of Sourcing Solutions LLC. In the unlikely event that your Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware product has recurring failures, Sourcing Solutions LLC, at its sole discretion, may elect to provide you with (a) a replacement unit of Sourcing Solutions LLC’s choosing that is the same or equivalent to your Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware product in performance or (b) to give you a refund of your purchase price instead of a replacement. This is your exclusive remedy for defective products.
It is mandatory that the unit product number and serial number (if applicable) be made available when requesting a warranty service event. Failure to do so may result in the event being deemed out of warranty.
Unless otherwise stated, and to the extent permitted by local law, new Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware products may be manufactured or assembled using new materials or new and used materials equivalent to new in performance and reliability. Sourcing Solutions LLC may repair or replace Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware products (a) with new or previously used products or parts equivalent to new in performance and reliability, or (b) with equivalent products to an original product that has become unavailable to Sourcing Solutions LLC. Replacement parts are warranted to be free from defects in material or workmanship for ninety (90) days or, for the remainder of the Limited Warranty Period of the Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware product they are replacing or in which they are installed, whichever is longer.
Exclusions
Sourcing Solutions LLC does not guarantee that the operation of this product will be uninterrupted or error-free. Sourcing Solutions LLC is not responsible for damage that occurs as a result of your failure to follow instructions regarding the product issued or published by Sourcing Solutions LLC or the product manufacturer.
This Limited Warranty does not apply to expendable or consumable parts and does not extend to any product from which the serial number has been removed, or that was damaged or rendered defective:

as a result of accident, misuse, abuse, contamination, improper or inadequate maintenance or calibration or other external causes;
by operation outside the usage parameters stated in the product manufacturer’s specifications or product documentation (including burned monitor screens and incorrect input voltage);
by software, interfacing, parts or supplies not supplied by Sourcing Solutions LLC
improper site preparation or maintenance
virus infection
loss or damage in transit
by modification or service by anyone other than:
	
Sourcing Solutions LLC
the product manufacturer
a product manufacturer’s authorized service provider
your own installation of end-user replaceable manufacturer approved parts.



SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF ANY PROGRAMS, DATA, OR REMOVABLE STORAGE MEDIA. SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESTORATION OR REINSTALLATION OF ANY PROGRAMS OR DATA OTHER THAN SOFTWARE INSTALLED BY THE MANUFACTURER WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS MANUFACTURED.
Advanced Replacement Warranty Service
This Limited Warranty includes an advanced unit replacement warranty service. Under the terms of the advanced unit replacement warranty service, Sourcing Solutions LLC will ship a replacement unit directly to you if the Sourcing Solutions LLC hardware product you purchased is diagnosed as defective. On receiving the replacement unit, you will be required to return the defective unit back to Sourcing Solutions LLC, in the packaging that arrives with the replacement unit, within a defined period of time, normally five (5) days. Sourcing Solutions LLC will incur all shipping and insurance costs to return the defective unit to Sourcing Solutions LLC. Failure to return the defective unit may result in Sourcing Solutions LLC withholding your credit for the defective unit.
Limitation of Liability:
IF THE SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC HARDWARE PRODUCT FAILS TO WORK AS WARRANTED ABOVE, SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE PRICE PAID FOR THE PRODUCT OR THE COST OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF ANY HARDWARE COMPONENTS THAT MALFUNCTION IN CONDITIONS OF NORMAL USE. EXCEPT AS INDICATED ABOVE, IN NO EVENT WILL SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE PRODUCT OR THE FAILURE OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORM, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF USE OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS OF ANY KIND, OR SPECIAL, INCREMENTAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM MADE BY A THIRD PARTY OR MADE BY YOU FOR THE THIRD PARTY. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES WHETHER DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT, OR A CLAIM MADE, UNDER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR AS A TORT CLAIM (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY), A CONTRACT CLAIM OR ANY OTHER CLAIM. THIS LIMITATION IN LIABILITY CANNOT BE WAIVERED OR AMENDED BY ANY PERSON. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL BE EFFECTIVE EVEN IF YOU HAVE ADVISED SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC, OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES OR EVEN IF SUCH POSSIBILITY WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may also have other rights that may vary from state to state or from county to country. You are advised to consult applicable state or country laws for a full determination of rights.
If Sourcing Solutions LLC determines that damage/failure that exists in a product that has been shipped back to Sourcing Solutions LLC is not covered by the warranty -- e.g. failure of Non-Sourcing Solutions LLC memory or options etc. -- the end user will be contacted to determine whether such damage/failure should be repaired for a charge or whether the Product should be returned to the end user as received. All associated transportation and handling costs are charged to the customer.
Disclaimer of Other Warranties:
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, SOURCING SOLUTIONS LLC MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING ANY MATTER, ITEM, OR PRODUCT, INCLUDING AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR ORIGINALITY.

Hello











Hello
By: Michael Rubin
Posted: November 30, 2015  | Announcements
Welcome to Sourcing Solutions’ new website! This is our first major redesign since we built the original site in 2012. Future changes and improvements will come much more quickly.
You’ll find our new web site both informative and easy to navigate, whether you’re looking for more information on our End of Life (or what we like to call eXtension of Life) and refurbished IT hardware, or our NETPATIBLES line of 100% compatible transceivers, direct attach cables (DAC), cables, and converters (see more on www.netpatibles.com).   We are just an email or phone call away as the first step in supplying the quality solutions you need.
You can also learn about what we call our Sourcing Solutions Advantage, as we strive to be your sole source for XOL and Refurbished IT hardware.  That’s been part of our mission since the company’s founding in 2010.
Navigate around our website, and you will find photographs and quotes from some of our employees. We’re a great company to do business with and a great place to work.  We strive to provide a challenging, growth-oriented environment that supports work/life balance, and I think we’ve been achieving that.  Also, look for the pictures of Lana, Zoë, and Kaia, part of our four-legged community at Sourcing Solutions.
When we’re in the news, post a press release, or win an award, we’ll let you know on our site. Did you realize that we’re one of the largest women owned businesses in Orange County and named 2015 Top Workplaces in Orange County award by the Orange County Register?
We’d like your input on the site (and our blogs). You can send this to blogger@sourcingsolutions.com   Also, please take the time to hook up with us on LinkedIn, by clicking on the icon below.
Have a happy holidays!
Mike

Sourcing Solutions

Our mission is to be the trusted alternative to managing the complexity and expense associated with the ever changing lifecycles of IT products. We are the only single source for new End of Life and refurbished IT Hardware across over 25 leading brands. We allow enterprises and data centers to remain standardized on a proven solution delivering eXtension of Life (XOL) solutions that contribute to a superior overall Total Cost of Ownership. Our products all carry industry leading advanced replacement warranty supported by our California based sales and service representatives that are ready to assist.






Industry Leading Alternative IT Solutions


EOL and Refurbished IT Hardware
A great source for End of Life (EOL) and refurbished IT hardware. Attractive pricing and warranties.


NETPATIBLES™
A complete selection of high quality, 100% OEM compatible transceivers, direct attach cables (DAC), and next generation technology for today’s high bandwidth network needs. Savings of up to 80% off the OEM original price. Superior warranties.


Sourcing Engine
Our proprietary turn-key Sourcing Engine delivers a large selection of IT hardware from over 25 leading brands which simplifies purchasing, speeds delivery, and easily obtain support for your purchases.












The Extension of Life Advantage
Today’s IT products can satisfy many end-users requirements well beyond when the OEM manufacturer dictates their End of Life and discontinues their sale of the products. Our commitment to continue to provide these products allows end-users to extend the life of their product deployments improving the total cost of ownership and freeing up capital for other projects.



Single Source for all Alternatives
Comprehensive selection of new and refurbished networking, system, and component products across every major OEM brand, means you won’t have to call multiple suppliers with various levels of quality and support.



Authentication and Validation Firewall
EOL and refurbished products carry an inherent risk of legitimacy and condition classification. That’s why all of our products go through our in-house Authentication and Validation Firewall to ensure our customers are getting exactly what is promised.



Industry Leading Warranties
3 year Advanced Replacement warranty on all networking and system products (1 Year on Components) provides you piece of mind after purchase.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
