Our story
As busy parents, we know that life is a balancing act and you need childcare that's reliable, trustworthy, and available‚ even at the last minute. That's why we've completely reinvented the process of finding a babysitter, so with a tap you can hire the sitters most trusted by your local community of parent-friends and neighbors.
We've also eliminated the hassle that comes along with hiring a babysitter, from scheduling to payment, so all you have to do is say "yes" to date nights, parent-teacher conferences, time for yourself and time with friends. At UrbanSitter, we celebrate parents who take care of their kids and themselves. Our hats are off to you‚ the ones who pull off the world's greatest balancing act.

Daisy DownsVP of Marketing & Co-Founder
Daisy is a Stanford graduate and started her career at a Bay Area startup. She then spent 10 years working for advertising agency Goodby, Silverstein and Partners in client services and digital production, advising global brands such as HP, Rolling Rock, and Frito Lay. After her daughter was born, Daisy admits she stopped going out because finding a babysitter was too time consuming and stressful. It was then that she realized there was a huge opportunity to make the process more efficient‚ and so, she teamed up to found UrbanSitter.
When not working, Daisy is most fond of spending time with her two daughters. Their favorite hot spots are the Academy of Sciences, Discovery Museum, and SF Zoo.

Andrea BarrettVP of Product & Co-Founder
After spending seven years at Intel in operations and product management, Andrea moved to San Francisco to join her first startup, TripIt. She was Director of Product Management there when she left in 2011 to co-found UrbanSitter. After Andrea had a baby, she was amazed at how archaic the process of finding and booking a sitter was. Working in the consumer social space, she felt there had to be a better way. And voila, UrbanSitter was born.
Outside of work, Andrea enjoys spending time with her husband and two-year old son and is an avid cook. Each weekend brings a new culinary adventure. Some are hits and some are misses. Surprisingly similar to startup life!

Jessica SteelPresident
Prior to joining UrbanSitter, Jessica served as Executive Vice President of Business and Corporate Development at Pandora, and was one of the original members of the team that conceived, launched and scaled the business. During her eight-year tenure at Pandora, Jessica forged the highly successful strategic partnerships that accelerated the company's growth and helped pave the way to an eventual IPO.
Prior to working at Pandora, Jessica spent four years leading international business development at Overture Services, Inc., which became part of Yahoo! in 2003. Jessica conveniently timed the birth of her son in the same year that UrbanSitter launched, and she has been a happy customer of the service from the early days. Thanks to UrbanSitter, date nights are a regular occurrence in the Steel household.
Jessica is a graduate of The University of Pennsylvania, and has a Master's degree from the London School of Economics. Outside of work, she enjoys family time, tennis and pursuing her passion for music as a singer-songwriter, performing under the name "Jessica Stone." She also serves as a strategy and business advisor to several companies.
