Renewable Energy Thought Leader Thomas S. Murley Joins Ameresco Board 
      of Directors






October 28, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE: AMRC), a leading energy efficiency and renewable 
      energy company, announced today that Thomas S. Murley was elected to 
      serve on Ameresco’s Board of Directors.
    


      Mr. Murley is Chairman and Senior Advisor to HgCapital's Renewable Power 
      Partners Funds, which he co-founded and led for HgCapital from 2004 to 
      June 2016. Mr. Murley also serves as a Non-Executive Director and 
      Investment Committee member of the UK Green Investment Bank and is a 
      director of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.
    

      “With more than 20 years’ of experience strategically managing funds in 
      the conventional and renewable energy sectors, Tom is a valuable 
      addition to our Board,” said George P. Sakellaris, Chairman, President 
      and Chief Executive Officer of Ameresco. “His extensive experience and 
      knowledge in this area will complement the strengths of our other 
      members, and I expect he will be a tremendous asset to Ameresco and our 
      shareholders.”
    

      “Having devoted much of my career to securing capital for renewable 
      energy projects and working with investors in the renewable energy 
      industry, I am excited to join Ameresco, which has a demonstrated 
      commitment to innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency 
      solutions,” said Murley.
    

      Prior to founding HgCapital, Mr. Murley was a managing director at EIF 
      Group, the first private equity fund for the power industry, and an 
      investment partner at Allianz Private Equity, following its purchase of 
      EIF Group in 2001.
