	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	These 106,665 shares of Class A Common Stock were acquired upon the vesting of 153,846 restricted stock units on January 12, 2016 pursuant to the Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Plan. Each unit represents the right to acquire 1.1 shares of Class A Common Stock (reflecting the stock dividend of one share of Class A Common Stock for every ten shares of Class A Common Stock paid in December 2015). The vested units were settled in shares of Class A Common Stock (a total amount of 169,230 shares). In connection with the vesting of the units, 62,565 shares of Class A Common Stock were withheld by Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. in payment of the reporting person's tax withholding liability incurred as a result of the vesting of the units. The reporting person previously reported that 61,195 shares of Class A Common Stock were withheld in payment of such withholding liability but such number was incorrect and this filing corrects such error.









	(2) 





	These 153,846 restricted stock units vested on January 12, 2016 and were settled in shares of Class A Common Stock as reported in Table I on this Form 4.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. Mr. Curiliuc has agreed to
loan us funds to implement our business plan and maintain our reporting status
and quotation on the OTCBB until we raise funds from this offering. Mr. Curiliuc
will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for
the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Curiliuc and the loan bears interest
at 0% per annum. Mr. Curiliuc will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. 

The above expenditures are defined as follows: 

Legal and Professional Fees: Pertains to legal services and accounting fees that
will be incurred by the company. Estimated cost will be $9,200. This amount
consists of $2,500 for legal fees; $86.36 for printing costs; $2,300 for
accounting fees and expenses; $3,000 for auditor fees and expenses; $1,300 for
transfer agent fees; and $13.64 for the registration filing fee. 

Costs Associated with being a Public Company: Pertains to filing fees associated
with Edgar filings, stock transfer agent fees, and other miscellaneous fees. 

Marketing: Pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our services. 

Website development: Design, development, launching and maintaining our website 

Office rent: Payment for office rent. Also will include telephone services,
mail, office supplies charge. 

Purchase of inventory: We are going to buy inventory of electric scooters,
electric bikes, hoverboards, segways, etc. 

Others expenses: Pertains to the funds allocated to travel expenses.


Our major, notable competitors will be: Airboard, Cyboard, Esway, Future Foot,
Hovertrax. 

We are hoping to implement some new features on our products to be competitive
with those companies. Our product prices will be within our competitors price
range. Our disadvantage will be brand recognition and we hope to use different
marketing strategy to make our brand recognized.


Company Description
We will buy the electric transportation products wholesale from Chinese
manufacturers and sell these products via our website. We will concentrate our
first year of operation in Europe, expanding our second year of operation to the
North American market. Our main selling product will be the


 hoverboard. 

The two-wheeled self-balancing electric scooter is commonly referred to as a
hoverboard, is a type of portable, rechargeable battery-powered scooter. They
typically consist of two wheels arranged side-by-side, with two small platforms
between the wheels, on which the rider stands. The device is controlled by the
rider’s feet, standing on the built-in gyroscopic and sensored pads. There is no
universally accepted name for the device, as its various product names are
attributable to the companies which distribute it and not its manufacturers. 

Also we intend to resell electric bikes and segways.

Industry experts discuss the evolution to iXBRL for financial reporting

Posted on October 27, 2016 | Leave a comment


Greater transparency, lower filing costs, reduced risks and better data quality – these long-promised benefits of XBRL are finally becoming a reality. As the XBRL landscape continues its swift evolution, we discussed the latest developments with five experts – as well as with a representative of the SEC.

.
Vintage Question > In June, the SEC announced that it would start accepting structured financial data in the Inline XBRL (iXBRL) format. What do you see as the main benefits and challenges of this new format?
Jaret Klekota > As with anything new, there are going to be challenges making sure that companies understand what all the requirements are, and what changes there are between their current process and the iXBRL process. For example, there are “hidden tags” in iXBRL – companies need to understand what this means and what they should be doing in that area.
Since the SEC says that companies should really be focusing on the quality of the data, having the XBRL embedded into the HTML financial filing could free up companies from making sure the statement was rendering on the previewer in the same way as the HTML, and instead focus on appropriate tagging. iXBRL can help them embrace and streamline that review process, since there will no longer be two separate documents to compare and try to identify the differences between them.
For now, filing the iXBRL version is voluntary but I think there’s going to be a gradual increase in filings. Some may wait a bit longer in the process to see how it goes, and also wait until they are more comfortable around the requirements before filing.

Ilya Vadeiko > In our opinion, the benefits are huge and obvious. If regular XBRL requires separate reporting and creates a significant duplication of work for auditors and filers – as well as gaps in logic – iXBRL eliminates the separation between traditional HTML and new XBRL formats, as Jaret mentions. This solves many existing problems in terms of consistency and accuracy. In terms of implementation, I would guess that this would require a fusion or transformation of old (HTML) and new (XBRL) reporting processes and procedures. This may be challenging for large filers who have already established such parallel procedures.
Hudson Hollister > For companies that have adopted disclosure management software, which is most of them, it does not take any additional effort to report using iXBRL. But, as Jaret points out, this is currently voluntary. Companies can continue reporting two versions of the financial statements if they want to, and many companies have created a review process that assumes two versions. They have some people in charge of reviewing the document and other people in charge of reviewing the data.
Even though that might be less efficient, it is not without cost to change the process. Many companies are so busy with the compliance that they might not bother. Of course, we would say that in the long run, companies should take advantage of this opportunity to combine those review processes, because it will get them ready for when the SEC moves to mandatory iXBRL – and we think the Commission will make it mandatory. Some leaders inside the SEC are hoping to propose a move to mandatory within the next year.
The reason for moving to mandatory iXBRL is beyond just fixing the problem with the financial statement itself. Inline will allow huge progress. Think about the 10-Q and the 10-K — right now, these documents are lengthy, and there is so much in them that could be structured but isn’t. For example, the cover page of the 10-Q and the 10-K have check-boxes that say what kind of company the filer is. Right now, those check-boxes are not connected to any database. If the SEC switched to using data fields instead of the document form, they could have a field that says “Check the box for which type of company you are,” and we could automatically generate a list of the all the wellknown seasoned issuers.
Campbell Pryde > Most of the work for iXBRL should be done by software, and so one of the challenges is making sure that the people preparing the files have the technology to do it. As of early August, there had been a total of four iXBRL filings – and even that number was surprising to me, since the SEC just announced it. Most people will wait and see what happens and it’s going to take a couple of months for the software community to update their systems to support the format.

REPORT: Preference for online annual reports increased 15% since 2012

Posted on October 26, 2016 | Leave a comment


Since the passing of the SEC’s “notice and access” regulation, investors’ preference for online annual reports have finally surpassed ink-and-paper. When we first canvassed this question to Main and Wall (combined) in 2012, 36% reported they prefer online and 49% still preferred printed.
As you see below, slowly but surely, research preferences have evolved.

TAKE ACTION: We help all issuers prepare for their next annual report budget – online and hardcopy –  by auditing their most current annual report, page-by-page.  Simply upload your 2015 annual report PDF here.

Posted in 2017: How Investors Consume IR Content (Wall v Main Streets) 



Balance your 13F-based IR targeting with the Cision Communications Cloud

Posted on October 25, 2016 | 1 comment


Yesterday’s sensational launch of our new Cision Communication Cloud provides marketing departments and PR professionals the tools and tactics that investor relations officers have already benefited from for years… namely highly focused data-driven targeting to verified influencers.
However, rather than parsing tangible 13F files to discover and build relationships with institutional investors, our Cision Communication Cloud ™ connects companies with journalists, influencers and customer advocates by understanding and parsing the intangibles of corporate communications into actionable data.

The New Cision Communication Cloud finally unifies the previously disparate systems of content, tools, data, and analytics:

Listen to media channels for brand mentions, competitive activity and trending topics that will inspire compelling content. There’s so much to be inspired by: Cision automated media insights cover over 2M daily news stories across online, print, broadcast, and social channels.  Aggregate trending and emerging topics, key influencers, brand and competitive insights and more into email alerts, reports, and charts, to show you how your content will resonate across mediums and audiences around the world.


Target and build relationships with key influencers and decision-makers by harnessing a wealth of data and predictive insights to fine-tune content delivery by audience and channel. Influencers matter more than ever; there are just more of them, and they are not as easy to find. The breadth and depth of our industry-leading platform provides you with easy access to the influencers who matter.


Create an effective earned media and content strategy by combining your talent with our well-versed team of industry experts who will deliver insights, strategy, best practices, and hands-on help in delivering high impact communications that amplify the results of your programs as part of a holistic customer and influencer relationship strategy.


Engage audiences and maximize the impact of your content with multichannel promotion across earned, paid and owned channels. Powered by PR Newswire, you’ll have access to the world’s largest and #1 most trusted distribution network and well as trigger market demand through a network of over 300,000media distribution points in over 170 countries and 40 languages; 10,000+ websites and apps, 1 million social followers, and hundreds of broadcast channels.


Analyze what’s working and what’s not, so you can continuously optimize ongoing campaign performance in real-time.  Customizable reports and data visualization focus you on the strategic, while tracking the tactical – connecting the dots across social and traditional media channels for a 360 degree view of your campaigns.

Certainly, the earned media “audience” that our new platform will be of importance to IR as well, as we know (FROM THIS BLOG POST) that a meaningful percentage or IROs actively court and woo financial media.
Balance your IR targeting with the Cision Communications Cloud – request a demonstration here.

How is your CACM IQ? (you know, the say-on-pay ratio math thing)

Posted on October 21, 2016 | Leave a comment


Understanding and calculating your Consistently Applied Compensation Measure may seem a tad premature, seeing how your company does not need to disclose its pay ratio in this FYE of December 31 2016’s annual reports and proxy materials.

For most companies, these disclosures must be included in annual reports and proxy statements beginning FYE for the first fiscal year beginning on or after December 31, 2017.
That means you need to work this math very soon and the CACM should be a consideration as you’re making 2017 compensation decisions.
Per Sullivan & Crowell LLP:
“Companies may find it helpful to conduct dry-runs of the calculation based on past compensation data in order to develop an appropriate methodology, identify and resolve interpretive, practical or disclosure issues, and ensure that systems are in place to capture information necessary to support the chosen methodology. Companies should also be mindful that the pay ratio rule requires disclosure of the methodology used to determine the median employee and any material assumptions, adjustments or estimates used to identify the median employee or to determine total compensation.”
On Wednesday, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance posted five new CDIs (FAQs) to help US public companies further work their the pay ratio disclosure CACMs.

Question: If a registrant does not use annual total compensation calculated using Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K (“annual total compensation”) to identify the median employee, how should a registrant select another consistently applied compensation measure (“CACM”) to identify the median employee?


Question: May a registrant exclusively use hourly or annual rates of pay as its CACM?


Question: When a registrant uses a CACM to identify the median employee, what time period may it use? Must the period include the date on which the employee population is determined? Must it always be for an annual period? May it use the prior fiscal year?


Question: When someone is furloughed on the date that the registrant uses to determine the population of its employees from which it is required to identify the median, must the registrant include the furloughed person in the employee population used to identify the median employee, and, if included in the population, how should the furloughed employee’s compensation be calculated?


Question: Under what circumstances is a worker employed and his or her compensation determined by an unaffiliated third party such that the worker is considered an independent contractor or leased worker under the rule? When is a registrant considered to be determining the compensation of a worker?

You can read their answers here. Also, ask your securities law firm for their interpretation.
What Vintage will be doing – throughout 2017 – is working with clients and partners to create best practices in regard to communicating CACM visually in your annual report and proxy materials. Our president, Liam Power, recently commented on this.
Beside’s Liam, Cooley’s executive comp blog is a good read, too.

New whitepaper chronicles the state-of-the-XBRL-union today

Posted on October 19, 2016 | 1 comment



.
eXtensible Business Reporting Language is becoming mainstream as costs stabilize, data quality improves and investor analysis capabilities expand substantially.
Greater transparency, lower filing costs, reduced risks and better data quality – these long-promised benefits of XBRL are finally becoming a reality. How can issuer and investors take full advantage?
When the XBRL data reporting standard became mandatory in 2009, optimism reigned that structured data would allow for vast analytical possibilities. Businesses, regulators, and investors would be able to compare data across public companies at the push of a button.
Reality quickly set in, however. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not enforce high data quality. Filers created huge numbers of confusing extensions. And data providers often ignored the filings as a result.
Thankfully, in recent years, the situation has improved dramatically. “Through initiatives such as the XBRL US Data Quality Committee, the integrity of business information filed through XBRL has become significantly better. Slowly but surely, the huge potential of the reporting language is beginning to be realized,” commented Liam Power, President at Vintage, a PR Newswire division.

Perhaps the most critical development of 2016 has been the announcement by the SEC in June that it would allow companies to use Inline XBRL (or iXBRL) to file their quarterly and annual financial statements. This version allows companies to file financial information in a single document, instead of keeping the traditional and XBRL versions separate. Eventually, the hope is that this will reduce complexity for filers, as well as the risk of error.
At the same time, data aggregators are starting to make full use of XBRL data, having found ways to clean up errors and manage extensions. This has opened up a great treasure trove of information for investors and businesses.
As the XBRL landscape continues its swift evolution, we discussed the latest developments with five experts – as well as with a representative of the SEC.
