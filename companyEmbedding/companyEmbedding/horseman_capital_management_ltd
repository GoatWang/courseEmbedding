ACCREDITED INVESTOR DEFINITION
For the prospective investing entity (the "Investor"):

The Investor is a natural person whose individual net worth (net worth for this purpose means total assets, excluding the Investor’s primary residence, in excess of total liabilities), or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds $1,000,000.
The Investor is a natural person who had individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the last two calendar years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in this calendar year.

                                                    The Investor is an entity with total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $5,000,000, which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and which is one of the following:
                                                    
a corporation; or 
a partnership; or
a business trust; or
a tax-exempt organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended


The Investor is a personal (non-business) trust with total assets in excess of $5,000,000 which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and whose decision to invest in the Fund has been directed by a person who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment.
The Investor is a personal (non-business) revocable trust and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust was an accredited investor.

it has total assets in excess of $5,000,000; or
the investment decision is being made by a plan fiduciary which is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; or
it is a self-directed plan (i.e., a tax-qualified defined contribution plan in which a participant may exercise control over the investment of assets credited to his or her account) and the decision to invest is made by those participants investing, and each such participant qualifies as an accredited investor.


The Investor is an employee benefit plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, which has total assets in excess of $5,000,000.
The Investor is licensed, or subject to supervision, by U.S. federal or state examining authorities as a "bank", "savings and loan association", "insurance company", or "small business investment company" (as such terms are used and defined in 17 CFR §230.501(a)) or is an account for which a bank or savings and loan association is subscribing in a fiduciary capacity and over which such fiduciary exercises investment discretion.
The Investor is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer or an investment company; or has elected to be treated or qualifies as a "business development company" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.
                                    

 Yes
No





x

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

Pillar 3


Pillar 3 Disclosure - as at 31st March 2016
Horseman Capital Management Ltd (the “Firm”) was incorporated in England on 14 July 2000 and is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). It is a full scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) able to provide discretionary investment management services to Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) and segregated managed accounts. The Firm is categorised by the FCA as a collective portfolio management investment firm (“CPMI”) and a BIPRU (Prudential sourcebook for Banks, Building Societies and Investment Firms) Limited Licence investment firm for regulatory capital purposes.
Risk Management
The Directors of the Firm determine its business strategy and the risk appetite. They have designed and implemented a risk management framework that recognizes the risks that the business faces as part of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (”ICAAP”). The Directors also determine how those risks may be mitigated, managed and assessed on an ongoing basis. The Directors meet on a regular basis and discuss projections for profitability, liquidity, regulatory capital, business planning and risk management. The Firm’s ICAAP is formally reviewed annually, but will be amended should there be any material changes to the Firm’s business or risk profile.
As an AIFM, the Firm is mainly exposed to business and operational risk; however there is additional exposure to credit risk and foreign exchange position risk. These exposures are regarded as typical for a business engaged in investment management.

Business risk includes the risk of reduction in assets under management, the loss of key staff and the failure of the Firm’s control infrastructure. Business risks and arrangements for their mitigation are assessed as part of the ICAAP.
Operational risk - This covers a range of operational exposures from risk of clerical errors to risk of breach of a Fund’s investment objectives. Legal and reputational risks are also included. Operational risks and their mitigation are assessed as part of the ICAAP.
Credit risk - This includes the Firm’s exposure to its clients for non-payment of management and performance fees and counterparty exposure relating to the Firm’s bank balances and other debtors. This is monitored by the COO and Fund Controller.
Market risk - The risk is the exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations due to investment management and performance fees being denominated in currencies other than sterling.

Capital Adequacy
As a CPMI firm the Company is subject to both the regulatory capital regimes of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), in respect of its Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”), and relevant provisions applicable to investment firms contained in the Capital Requirement Directive (“CRD”), as amended, for the Firm.
Capital requirements arising from Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the CRD are compared to any higher requirements arising from the AIFMD asset based capital calculation and professional indemnity insurance (“PII”) elements to derive the total regulatory capital required by the Firm.
The Pillar 1 capital requirement is the greater of:
a base capital requirement of Euro 50,000; or
the sum of its market and credit risk requirements; or
the Fixed Overhead Requirement (“FOR”), representing a quarter of the Firm’s audited fixed annual expenditure.

Pillar 2 capital is calculated by the Firm as representing any additional capital to be maintained against any risks not adequately covered under the requirement in Pillar 1 as part of its ICAAP.
The capital resources of the business comprise Tier 1 capital with no deductions.


It is the Firm’s experience that the FOR establishes its capital requirements with market and credit risks not being material. The Firm applies the standardised approach, being 8% of the relevant risk weighted exposure amount, to credit risk arising on outstanding investment management fees and bank balances. The Firm’s ICAAP has confirmed that no additional Pillar 2 capital is required in excess of its Pillar 1 capital requirement.
As at 31 March 2016 the Firm’s combined regulatory capital position is:



Capital Item
£000




Capital Resources: Share Capital and Audited Reserves
4,842


Total Capital Requirement: Fixed Overhead Requirement (and AIFMD PII capital requirement)
757




Remuneration Code
The aim of the BIPRU Remuneration Code (the “Code”) is to ensure that firms have risk focused remuneration policies which promote and are consistent with effective risk management, and do not expose firms to excessive risk.
The Firm is classified as a Proportionality Level Three Firm, the lowest risk category as it does not manage or trade proprietary positions. As a result the Firm can dis-apply many of the technical requirements of the Code and apply proportionality as determined by the FCA.
The Firm is also subject to the AIFMD Remuneration Code but, has taken into account the FCA’s view that the application of the AIFM Remuneration Code should satisfy compliance with the BIPRU Remuneration Code insofar as the AIFM Code provisions are deemed equivalent. Having considered the application of both Remuneration Codes, the Firm is satisfied that its remuneration arrangements are not required to vary depending upon which Remuneration Code is applicable.
Under the FCA’s BIPRU Rules firms are required to disclosure their remuneration policy and practices, as well as aggregate quantitative disclosure for staff assessed as having a material impact on its risk profile, including senior management (“Code Staff”). Remuneration as defined by the Code includes all forms of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration but excludes return on equity (capital).
Remuneration Policies
The Firm has adopted policies in relation to the Firm’s remuneration arrangements which address potential conflicts of interest arising from such arrangements by taking into account the controls in place to guard against the Firm’s authorised persons being rewarded for taking inappropriate levels of risk.
The Firm is satisfied that the policies in place are appropriate to its size, internal organization and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities.
Decision Making Process
The Firm’s Remuneration Policy is determined by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer, who is also the Firm’s Compliance Officer (“CFO/CO”). The Firm has assessed its members and staff and concludes that only six members of staff qualified as Code Staff during the performance year to 31 March 2016.
Link between Pay and Performance
Remuneration subject to the Code is based on an assessment of the profitability of the Firm, an individual’s performance and their contribution to the business carried on by the Firm.
Overall remuneration includes a profit allocation which is determined by the CEO and CFO/CO of the Firm reflecting individual performance as well as the Firm’s overall performance.
Quantitative Remuneration Data
The Firm conducts only investment management business. The total aggregate remuneration, as defined in the Code, for senior management Code Staff for the performance year to 31 March 2016 was £270,000 and was all fixed remuneration. £417,437 of which £167,437 was fixed and £250,000 was variable remuneration was awarded to other Code Staff whose actions have a material impact on the risk profile of the Firm.

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.
                                    

 Yes
No





x

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

Yes
No

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

No

ACCREDITED INVESTOR DEFINITION
For the prospective investing entity (the "Investor"):

The Investor is a natural person whose individual net worth (net worth for this purpose means total assets, excluding the Investor’s primary residence, in excess of total liabilities), or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds $1,000,000.
The Investor is a natural person who had individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the last two calendar years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in this calendar year.

                                                    The Investor is an entity with total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $5,000,000, which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and which is one of the following:
                                                    
a corporation; or 
a partnership; or
a business trust; or
a tax-exempt organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended


The Investor is a personal (non-business) trust with total assets in excess of $5,000,000 which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and whose decision to invest in the Fund has been directed by a person who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment.
The Investor is a personal (non-business) revocable trust and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust was an accredited investor.

                                                    The Investor is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
                                                    
it has total assets in excess of $5,000,000; or
the investment decision is being made by a plan fiduciary which is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; or
it is a self-directed plan (i.e., a tax-qualified defined contribution plan in which a participant may exercise control over the investment of assets credited to his or her account) and the decision to invest is made by those participants investing, and each such participant qualifies as an accredited investor.


The Investor is an employee benefit plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, which has total assets in excess of $5,000,000.
The Investor is licensed, or subject to supervision, by U.S. federal or state examining authorities as a "bank", "savings and loan association", "insurance company", or "small business investment company" (as such terms are used and defined in 17 CFR §230.501(a)) or is an account for which a bank or savings and loan association is subscribing in a fiduciary capacity and over which such fiduciary exercises investment discretion.
The Investor is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer or an investment company; or has elected to be treated or qualifies as a "business development company" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).

                                                        Entities which are required to be authorised or regulated to operate in the international financial markets:

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.
                                    

 Yes
No





x

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

Yes
No

ACCREDITED INVESTOR DEFINITION
For the prospective investing entity (the "Investor"):

The Investor is a natural person whose individual net worth (net worth for this purpose means total assets, excluding the Investor’s primary residence, in excess of total liabilities), or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds $1,000,000.
The Investor is a natural person who had individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the last two calendar years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in this calendar year.

                                                    The Investor is an entity with total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $5,000,000, which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and which is one of the following:
                                                    
a corporation; or 
a partnership; or
a business trust; or
a tax-exempt organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended


The Investor is a personal (non-business) trust with total assets in excess of $5,000,000 which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and whose decision to invest in the Fund has been directed by a person who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment.
The Investor is a personal (non-business) revocable trust and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust was an accredited investor.

                                                    The Investor is an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 which satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
                                                    
it has total assets in excess of $5,000,000; or
the investment decision is being made by a plan fiduciary which is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; or
it is a self-directed plan (i.e., a tax-qualified defined contribution plan in which a participant may exercise control over the investment of assets credited to his or her account) and the decision to invest is made by those participants investing, and each such participant qualifies as an accredited investor.


The Investor is an employee benefit plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, which has total assets in excess of $5,000,000.
The Investor is licensed, or subject to supervision, by U.S. federal or state examining authorities as a "bank", "savings and loan association", "insurance company", or "small business investment company" (as such terms are used and defined in 17 CFR §230.501(a)) or is an account for which a bank or savings and loan association is subscribing in a fiduciary capacity and over which such fiduciary exercises investment discretion.
The Investor is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer or an investment company; or has elected to be treated or qualifies as a "business development company" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).
The Investor is an entity in which all of the equity owners are persons described above.

PROFFESIONAL INVESTOR DEFINITION


                                                        Entities which are required to be authorised or regulated to operate in the international financial markets:

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.
                                    

 Yes
No





x

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

No

“The increase in completed wells and the substantial drop in legacy wells potentially indicates that new well production is increasingly cannibalising legacy production. The level of legacy decline is very significant issue. Permian producers have struggled to stay ahead of the legacy decline of the field.”

ACCREDITED INVESTOR DEFINITION
For the prospective investing entity (the "Investor"):

The Investor is a natural person whose individual net worth (net worth for this purpose means total assets, excluding the Investor’s primary residence, in excess of total liabilities), or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, at the time of his purchase exceeds $1,000,000.
The Investor is a natural person who had individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the last two calendar years, or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years, and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in this calendar year.

                                                    The Investor is an entity with total assets at the time of purchase in excess of $5,000,000, which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and which is one of the following:
                                                    
a corporation; or 
a partnership; or
a business trust; or

The Investor is a personal (non-business) trust with total assets in excess of $5,000,000 which was not formed for the purpose of investing in the Fund and whose decision to invest in the Fund has been directed by a person who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment.
The Investor is a personal (non-business) revocable trust and each settlor or other person who has contributed assets to the trust was an accredited investor.

it has total assets in excess of $5,000,000; or
the investment decision is being made by a plan fiduciary which is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; or
it is a self-directed plan (i.e., a tax-qualified defined contribution plan in which a participant may exercise control over the investment of assets credited to his or her account) and the decision to invest is made by those participants investing, and each such participant qualifies as an accredited investor.


The Investor is an employee benefit plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisions, which has total assets in excess of $5,000,000.
The Investor is licensed, or subject to supervision, by U.S. federal or state examining authorities as a "bank", "savings and loan association", "insurance company", or "small business investment company" (as such terms are used and defined in 17 CFR §230.501(a)) or is an account for which a bank or savings and loan association is subscribing in a fiduciary capacity and over which such fiduciary exercises investment discretion.
The Investor is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer or an investment company; or has elected to be treated or qualifies as a "business development company" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or Section 202(a)(22) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).

                                        We are limited in providing details of Horseman’s Funds to investors who are not Professional Investors. In the UK you must be a Professional Client (as defined in the UK Financial Conduct Authority  (”FCA”) Rules) or for potential non-UK investors you otherwise are permitted to receive Fund details  pursuant to local private placement requirements.
                                        Where you have not fallen under the Professional Investor definition you may wish to elect to opt-up Elective Professional Client status. 
                                        


                                        Do you wish to elect to be treated as an Elective Professional Client? This may permit access to Horseman Fund details, depending upon your jurisdiction and you having sufficient knowledge and understanding of the nature of and risk inherent in unregulated Funds. If you elect to do this you will lose certain regulatory protections that you would otherwise have as a Retail Client.
                                    

 Yes
No





x

ELECTIVE PROFESSIONAL CLIENT DEFINITION
You may wish to elect to opt-up to be treated as a Professional Client (an “Elective Professional Client”) in order for us to supply information to you, following our assessment and approval. Elective Professional Clients lose the benefit of regulatory protections afforded to Retail Clients, so any decision to opt up must be carefully considered.  To fulfil the requirements to opt up to Elective Professional Client status, certain quantitative and qualitative criteria must be fulfilled, potential investors must be aware of and recognise the consequences of the regulatory protections they will lose as a result of opting up and they must agree to being treated as an Elective Professional Client.



Have you worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position requiring knowledge of the transactions and/or services sought?

Yes
No



                                        Have you carried out transactions in significant size in the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous 4 quarters?
                                    

Yes
No


 Protections you will lose as a consequence of being classified as an Elective Professional Client:

                                        NOTICE OF REGULATORY PROTECTIONS YOU WILL LOSE BEING CATEGORISED AS A PROFESSIONAL CLIENT
                                    

                                        As a consequence of this categorisation you will lose some protections which apply exclusively to Retail Clients under the Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) which we are obliged to draw to your attention.
                                        
Promotion of Unregulated Funds: The regulatory protection restricting the promotion of unregulated funds is removed.
Appropriateness: Where we are assessing the appropriateness of a complex product (including unregulated funds) we are entitled to assume that you have the necessary level of experience and understanding to understand the risks involved.
Your Understanding of Risk: As a Professional Client we can make certain assumptions about your understanding of risks which is not the case if you are categorised as a Retail Client. For example, the risks involved in investing in unregulated Funds may be greater than with regulated funds, including but not exclusively lack of transparency, lack of liquidity restricting re-sale and the possibility of a greater level of risk in its investment strategy.
Communications: We may have regard to your investment expertise when complying with requirements under the regulatory system that communications must be fair, clear and not misleading. Whilst, however, we would seek to ensure that communications comply with this standard, the level of detailed disclosures, for example, relating to the disclosure of past performance, is reduced for Professional Clients.
Information disclosures: The level of information that the Firm is required to disclose about itself and its services is not as detailed as is required for a Retail Client.
Complaints and Disputes: You would lose the right of access to the Financial Services Ombudsman in the UK for arbitration on complaints or disputes.
Non-compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme: Professional Clients are unlikely to be "eligible complainants" entitled to compensation under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme in the event that an authorised firm is unable to fulfil its financial obligations.

                                        If, at any time, you consider that our assessment is no longer appropriate and it is no longer reasonable to categorise you as a Professional Client, to enable us to continue promoting Funds or provide general investment advice to you, you should inform us immediately.
                                    
I have read and understood the regulatory protections I will lose by being categorised as an Elective Professional Client

Advice

Fund/s
HCM does not market the Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) it manages.

Subscriptions may only be made on the basis of the relevant prospectus and most recent financial statement and semi-annual financial statements published thereafter. 
Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Stock markets and currency movements may cause the value of investments and income from them to fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the amount they originally invested.
