Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value fluctuate so your units, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
		









Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the series' performance results would be less favorable. All results assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The performance is as of the date shown; it may not include the series' entire investment portfolio and is subject to change.
		





Initial Class shares have no sales charge.
		





The returns for the series shown do not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with variable products, such as mortality and expense risk charges, separate account charges, and sales charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts. Such expenses would reduce the overall returns shown. Please refer to the variable product's annual report for performance that reflects the deduction of the fees and charges imposed by insurance company separate accounts.
		





 Withdrawals of earnings or other taxable amounts are subject to income tax and, if made prior to age 59 1/2, may be subject to an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Early withdrawals reduce the death benefit.
		





No representation is made, and no assurance can be given, that any investment's results will be comparable to the investment results of any other product with similar investment objectives and policies, including products with the same investment professional or manager. Differences in portfolio size, investments held, contract and portfolio expenses, and other factors can be expected to affect performance.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The series may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the series.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

	Fund Overview
	

Objective 


						Seeks a high level of total return consistent with an aggressive level of risk relative to the other MFS Asset Allocation Funds.
					


Key Differentiators 


A strategically allocated, broadly diversified portfolio of MFS funds in a single investment
Utilizes a strategic risk-based approach to portfolio construction that efficiently diversifies across and within asset classes while simultaneously being actively-managed within the underlying MFS funds
Disciplined portfolio management is achieved through multi-level risk management, ensuring style consistency. Systematic rules-based rebalancing helps to maintain target risk profiles. Risk-return profiles have historically remained consistent with design.




Managers  











Team of Quantitative Professionals 

15 yrs.
						with Portfolio 
The team of quantitative investment professionals works with the Fund's portfolio manager to determine the asset allocation among the underlying MFS Funds in which the Fund invests. The team is comprised of analysts and portfolio managers who apply quantitative research across multiple factors to determine investment opportunities. These factors look to incorporate intuitive factors with sound economic rationale that provide systematic objective appraisals of company fundamentals and valuation, complementing our traditional fundamental research process.

Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the fund's performance results would be less favorable. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		





Sales Charges
		





Class A shares ("A") results include the maximum sales charge.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, currency, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions.
		





Investments in small-cap companies can be more volatile than investments in larger companies.   
		





MFS’ strategy of investing in underlying funds exposes the fund to the risks of the underlying funds.  Each underlying fund pursues its own objective and strategies and may not achieve its objective.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Morningstar Disclosure



The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
		



Morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns, which are not indicative of future results.




Class A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g., plan participants of a defined contribution plan.) Therefore, Morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchase the A share without paying the front load.
