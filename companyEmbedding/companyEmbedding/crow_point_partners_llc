August 04, 2016 08:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Recon Capital, an investment firm and exchange traded fund (ETF) 
      provider has expanded its product offerings by partnering with Crow 
      Point Partners, LLC, a boutique investment manager with a long track 
      record in global equity, alternative, and specialty fixed income 
      strategies, to offer the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (Symbol: GDPIX).
    


      “Today, with yield and volatility curves at historic lows, investors 
      face an inordinate amount of assymetric risk. Investment management 
      firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does 
      that,” said Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The 
      Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: 
      (1) a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the 
      majority of the fund’s invested assets; (2) a short duration, 
      high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve;and (3) a dynamic options overlay 
      for additional income.
    

      According to Garrett Paollela, CEO of Recon Capital and the fund’s 
      adviser, “Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short 
      strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product.” 
      The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimizes 
      income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that 
      maximizes income” Paollela added, “The closed-end fund structure gives a 
      manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a 
      long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between 
      higher yields and risk mitigation.”
    

      “We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in 
      options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield 
      buyer,” Paollela said. “Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally 
      suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that 
      income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to 
      present a product that does that.“ Paollela added, “Recon Capital is 
      committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver 
      market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving 
      needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion.”

Risk considerations


Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, 
      risks, charges and expenses of the Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund. 
      This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the 
      prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-844-348-7587 
      (844-DIV-PLUS) or at www.reconfunds.com/GDPIX. 
      The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. The Crow Point 
      Global Dividend Plus Fund is distributed by Northern Lights 
      Distributors, LLC member FINRA. Recon Capital Partners, LLC and Northern 
      Lights Distributors, LLC are not affiliated.


The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund is a continuously offered, 
      non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.


This investment may not be suitable for all investors and an 
      investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the 
      risks associated with the illiquidity of the Fund's shares and should be 
      viewed as a long-term investment.


      Long/ Short: Involves buying long equities that are expected to increase 
      in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in 
      value.
    

An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. The 
      Fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of income over the 
      long term. The Fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish 
      to exploit short-term swings in the stock market. The Fund cannot assure 
      you that the investment objectives will be achieved. Fund is not 
      intended to be a complete investment program. There are several risks 
      associated with transactions in options on securities used in connection 
      with the Fund’s options strategy. The Fund is a newly organized, 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment Management Company and it has no 
      operating history. The Fund will have substantial short positions. The 
      Fund is actively managed, and its performance will reflect the Adviser’s 
      ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the 
      Fund’s investment objectives.


The Fund may invest in securities that are traded in foreign markets 
      and that are not subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities 
      laws, markets and accounting requirements (“Foreign Securities”). 
      Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, 
      less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets. The 
      Fund intends to attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline 
      in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of 
      securities. The Fund will have substantial short positions.


Rising interest rates may adversely affect the price of the 
      securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s strategy of investing in 
      dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out 
      of favor with investors and underperform the market.


The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that have comparatively 
      smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are 
      included in major equity benchmark indices, which presents unique 
      investment risks. The Fund will not use external leverage to seek 
      to achieve its investment objectives, external leverage being defined as 
      borrowing funds from banks or other financial institutions, reverse 
      repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or the issuance of preferred 
      shares, or leverage in the form of a revolving credit facility. The Fund 
      may gain exposure to the real estate sector by investing in REITs, real 
      estate-linked derivatives, and common, preferred and convertible 
      securities of issuers in real estate-related industries. Each of these 
      types of investments are subject to risks similar to those associated 
      with direct ownership of real estate. Although the equity 
      securities in which the Fund invests generally trade on major stock 
      exchanges, certain securities may trade less frequently, potentially 
      those of issuers with smaller capitalizations. Securities with limited 
      trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements.


The use of Derivative Transactions may be speculative and involves 
      risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated 
      with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the 
      Fund seeks to close out an exchange-listed option position. The 
      Fund may sell index put and call options from time to time. Income 
      on options on individual stocks will generally not be recognized by the 
      Fund for tax purposes until an option is exercised, lapses or is subject 
      to a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that any 
      hedging activities of the Fund, including through derivative 
      transactions, will be successful. Fund may invest in the securities of 
      other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, and in 
      exchange- traded notes.


      The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund (the "Fund") is registered with 
      the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-diversified, 
      management investment company, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 
      1940. An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the loss 
      of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee the Fund will 
      achieve its investment objective. The Fund's shares may be more volatile 
      than the performance of a broadly diversified portfolio. The Fund is not 
      by itself a complete or balanced investment program.
    

      Market forces may result in shares trading at a significant premium or 
      discount to NAV. Although the shares are currently listed on an 
      exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for 
      the shares will develop or be maintained.
    

      The Fund's performance is expected to be closely tied to social, 
      political, and economic conditions within Europe and to be more volatile 
      than the performance of more geographically diversified funds. An 
      investment in European securities can be adversely affected by a variety 
      of factors, among which are: restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, 
      interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls imposed by 
      the European Union or European Monetary Union; historically high 
      unemployment and significant debt problems in certain European nations; 
      recently volatility in European financial markets due to concerns about 
      economic downturns or rising government debt levels. Currently, a 
      significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies 
      in France, Germany and Spain.
    

      Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and 
      may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including 
      countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates 
      and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of 
      the Fund's investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the 
      Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if 
      the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests 
      depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund's 
      holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.

 significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies

 Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and 
 may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including 
 countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates 
 and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of 
 the Fund's investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the 
 Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if 
 the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests 
 depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund's 
 holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.

News, Uncategorized  CROW POINT PARTNERS ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH FLOWPOINT CAPITAL			 BOSTON, November 21, 2016 — Crow Point Partners, LLC (“CPP”) and FlowPoint Capital Partners (“FlowPoint”) today announced a strategic partnership. The two Boston-based boutique managers will collaborate on existing and future product development, and Crow Point will provide FlowPoint with an outsourced operations platform.
The two firms entered into an operations agreement whereby Crow Point will provide FlowPoint with comprehensive middle and back office operations systems and business processes. FlowPoint managing partner Charles Trafton commented, “Crow Point can level the playing field for boutique managers like us by offering a complete outsourced operations platform at a fraction of the cost of an in-house solution, freeing managers to focus on what matters – performance and asset raising.”
“We appreciate FlowPoint’s idea-driven and disciplined approach to investing – the team’s proprietary market research and strategies are of great value,”said Peter DeCaprio, Co-Founder and CEO of Crow Point. As part of the strategic alliance, Crow Point has made a passive, non-voting minority investment in FlowPoint, and DeCaprio has been named a member of FlowPoint’s advisory board.
Trafton and FlowPoint Managing Director Paul Fusco will work closely together with DeCaprio to build on the strategic partnership. “We are excited to have Charles and Paul on board,” DeCaprio continued. “Partnering opportunities such as this help us achieve Crow Point’s objective of providing unique alternatives for the retail and institutional markets.”

CrowP9012016-11-29 13:30:312017-05-12 08:21:57CROW POINT PARTNERS ANNOUNCES STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH FLOWPOINT CAPITALNews, Uncategorized  Recon Capital & Crow Point Partners Launch the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (SYMBOL: GDPIX)			 Reprinted from Business Wire
 August 04, 2016 08:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time
GREENWICH, Conn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Recon Capital, an investment firm and exchange traded fund (ETF) provider has expanded its product offerings by partnering with Crow Point Partners, LLC, a boutique investment manager with a long track record in global equity, alternative, and specialty fixed income strategies, to offer the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (Symbol: GDPIX).
    “We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield buyer”
“Today, with yield and volatility curves at historic lows, investors face an inordinate amount of assymetric risk. Investment management firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does that,” said Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: (1) a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the majority of the fund’s invested assets; (2) a short duration, high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve;and (3) a dynamic options overlay for additional income.
According to Garrett Paollela, CEO of Recon Capital and the fund’s adviser, “Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product.” The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimizes income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that maximizes income” Paollela added, “The closed-end fund structure gives a manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between higher yields and risk mitigation.”
“We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield buyer,” Paollela said. “Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to present a product that does that.“ Paollela added, “Recon Capital is committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion.”

Risk considerations
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund. This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-844-348-7587 (844-DIV-PLUS) or at www.reconfunds.com/GDPIX. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund is distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC member FINRA. Recon Capital Partners, LLC and Northern Lights Distributors, LLC are not affiliated.
The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
This investment may not be suitable for all investors and an investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the illiquidity of the Fund’s shares and should be viewed as a long-term investment.
Long/ Short: Involves buying long equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. The Fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of income over the long term. The Fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to exploit short-term swings in the stock market. The Fund cannot assure you that the investment objectives will be achieved. Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program. There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities used in connection with the Fund’s options strategy. The Fund is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment Management Company and it has no operating history. The Fund will have substantial short positions. The Fund is actively managed, and its performance will reflect the Adviser’s ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the Fund’s investment objectives.
The Fund may invest in securities that are traded in foreign markets and that are not subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws, markets and accounting requirements (“Foreign Securities”). Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets. The Fund intends to attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of securities. The Fund will have substantial short positions.
Rising interest rates may adversely affect the price of the securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the market.
The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that have comparatively smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are included in major equity benchmark indices, which presents unique investment risks. The Fund will not use external leverage to seek to achieve its investment objectives, external leverage being defined as borrowing funds from banks or other financial institutions, reverse repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or the issuance of preferred shares, or leverage in the form of a revolving credit facility. The Fund may gain exposure to the real estate sector by investing in REITs, real estate-linked derivatives, and common, preferred and convertible securities of issuers in real estate-related industries. Each of these types of investments are subject to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate. Although the equity securities in which the Fund invests generally trade on major stock exchanges, certain securities may trade less frequently, potentially those of issuers with smaller capitalizations. Securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements.
The use of Derivative Transactions may be speculative and involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the Fund seeks to close out an exchange-listed option position. The Fund may sell index put and call options from time to time. Income on options on individual stocks will generally not be recognized by the Fund for tax purposes until an option is exercised, lapses or is subject to a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that any hedging activities of the Fund, including through derivative transactions, will be successful. Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, and in exchange- traded notes.
The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund (the “Fund”) is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-diversified, management investment company, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund’s shares may be more volatile than the performance of a broadly diversified portfolio. The Fund is not by itself a complete or balanced investment program.
Market forces may result in shares trading at a significant premium or discount to NAV. Although the shares are currently listed on an exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained.
The Fund’s performance is expected to be closely tied to social, political, and economic conditions within Europe and to be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds. An investment in European securities can be adversely affected by a variety of factors, among which are: restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls imposed by the European Union or European Monetary Union; historically high unemployment and significant debt problems in certain European nations; recently volatility in European financial markets due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels. Currently, a significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies in France, Germany and Spain.
Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund’s investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the Fund’s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund’s holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.

CrowP9012015-01-13 13:26:172017-05-12 08:21:57The Wall Street Transcript: Blending Quantitative Research with Fundamental AnalysisNews, Uncategorized  Perspectives: October 2014			 We view recent activity as indicative of a new reality in equity markets: that the market structure is radically different today than it was a decade ago and the old rules no longer apply.
Recent volatility in equity, fixed income and commodity markets was driven mostly by macro factors.
Recession fears in Europe, concerns regarding weakness in Asia, ISIS, Ebola and the potential end of Fed taper in October fueled extreme negative market reactions and most importantly, a notable short-term decline in liquidity. Some major equity indices reached correction territory, credit markets experienced significant weakness (especially the below-investment-grade sectors), energy markets saw large declines (mostly from geo-political maneuvering), and treasury yields approached decades-long lows. We view the volatility as technically–rather than a fundamentally–driven.
Most importantly, we view recent activity as indicative of a new reality in equity markets: that the market structure is radically different today than it was a decade ago and the old rules no longer apply. Absent an exogenous shock like Lehman Brothers, downside volatility is likely to be steep and short.
While it appears that liquidity has decreased, we believe the opposite is true – liquidity is much deeper than it used to be, and the liquidity suppliers are more disciplined, which means liquidity suppliers disappear and reappear quickly. In other words, we think the days of the “capitulation trade” so frequently referenced on CNBC, are over. There are simply too many pools of capital today, levered and un-levered, oriented toward short-term trading or not, that capital ultimately fills the vacuum. V-shaped recoveries in stock prices are here to stay.
In credit markets, we saw significant weakness in bank loans and high yield most likely driven by retail outflows. Fundamentally, corporate balance sheets remain healthy and the corporate default environment remains benign while yields have increased significantly. Considering the low default environment, high recovery value, and its floating rate nature, we believe this new, improved entry price point for bank loans is a compelling value. Likewise, we see the same in high yield, despite its fixed rate coupons. However, but not surprisingly, during this period of increased volatility the investment grade corporate market and liquid asset-backed securities market remained relatively stable, highlighting the benefits of allocating to this asset class.
The big declines in energy prices will ultimately have a net positive impact on the US economy. Citigroup research projected the impact of lower energy prices to represent approximately a $1.1 trillion stimulus to global economies. Lower energy prices may also have the potential to dampen further escalation of hostilities in Ukraine as the Russian economy is highly dependent on energy exports (indeed, we believe the move down in oil prices was orchestrated by Saudi Arabia in part to put pressure on Russia).
Overall, we believe that the macro variables support our thesis of continued US economic expansion. For this reason, we believe that the current fixed income market volatility represents opportunistic entry points for selective investment positions. This, however, should be done with caution as macro catalysts could continue to shift the markets and inject volatility.

Investment management firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does that,” said Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: (1) a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the majority of the fund’s invested assets; (2) a short duration, high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve;and (3) a dynamic options overlay for additional income.According to Garrett Paollela, CEO of Recon Capital and the fund’s adviser, “Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product.” The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimizes income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that maximizes income” Paollela added, “The closed-end fund structure gives a manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between higher yields and risk mitigation.”“We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield buyer,” Paollela said. “Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to present a product that does that.“ Paollela added, “Recon Capital is committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion.”About Recon Capital Partners:Recon Capital Partners, LLC is an SEC registered investment adviser headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Recon Capital Partners, LLC and Northern Lights Distributors, LLC are not affiliated.The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.This investment may not be suitable for all investors and an investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the illiquidity of the Fund's shares and should be viewed as a long-term investment.Read MoreLong/ Short: Involves buying long equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value.An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. The Fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of income over the long term. The Fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to exploit short-term swings in the stock market. The Fund cannot assure you that the investment objectives will be achieved. Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program. There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities used in connection with the Fund’s options strategy. The Fund is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment Management Company and it has no operating history. The Fund will have substantial short positions. The Fund is actively managed, and its performance will reflect the Adviser’s ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the Fund’s investment objectives.The Fund may invest in securities that are traded in foreign markets and that are not subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws, markets and accounting requirements (“Foreign Securities”). Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets. The Fund intends to attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of securities. The Fund will have substantial short positions.Rising interest rates may adversely affect the price of the securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the market.The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that have comparatively smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are included in major equity benchmark indices, which presents unique investment risks. The Fund will not use external leverage to seek to achieve its investment objectives, external leverage being defined as borrowing funds from banks or other financial institutions, reverse repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or the issuance of preferred shares, or leverage in the form of a revolving credit facility. The Fund may gain exposure to the real estate sector by investing in REITs, real estate-linked derivatives, and common, preferred and convertible securities of issuers in real estate-related industries. Each of these types of investments are subject to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate. Although the equity securities in which the Fund invests generally trade on major stock exchanges, certain securities may trade less frequently, potentially those of issuers with smaller capitalizations. Securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements.The use of Derivative Transactions may be speculative and involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the Fund seeks to close out an exchange-listed option position. The Fund may sell index put and call options from time to time. Income on options on individual stocks will generally not be recognized by the Fund for tax purposes until an option is exercised, lapses or is subject to a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that any hedging activities of the Fund, including through derivative transactions, will be successful. Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, and in exchange- traded notes.The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund (the "Fund") is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-diversified, management investment company, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund's shares may be more volatile than the performance of a broadly diversified portfolio. The Fund is not by itself a complete or balanced investment program.Market forces may result in shares trading at a significant premium or discount to NAV. Although the shares are currently listed on an exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained.The Fund's performance is expected to be closely tied to social, political, and economic conditions within Europe and to be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds. An investment in European securities can be adversely affected by a variety of factors, among which are: restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls imposed by the European Union or European Monetary Union; historically high unemployment and significant debt problems in certain European nations; recently volatility in European financial markets due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels. Currently, a significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies in France, Germany and Spain.Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund's investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund's holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.All trademarks or registered trademarks are the property of their respective ownersView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160804005250/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextShould You Buy Amazon ETFs Ahead of Q2 Earnings?ZacksZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredEnergy to Drive Q2 Earnings: Will ETFs Rebound?ZacksSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredRepublicans kill the border taxYahoo FinanceTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredAmazon wobble creates ripples across worldwide stock marketsReutersMattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted transgender ban, and he was reportedly 'appalled' by itBusiness InsiderWhite House comms director Scaramucci: 'I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own c--k'Business Insider"Women Need To Carry This Device With Them"Siren SongSponsoredAmazon could be the first trillion dollar company: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoRolls-Royce Motor CEO: We’re not in the auto business.
