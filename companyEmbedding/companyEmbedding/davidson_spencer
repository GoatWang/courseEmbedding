Size Tips:



For the most accurate measurements, have someone else do the measuring, stand tall, yet relaxed and let the 
                arms hang down at the sides.  Keep the tape measure snug against the body and the tape measure parallel to the ground.
                Measurements are to be used as genereal guidelines for the corresponding sizes.
Caps:  Measeure the head, just above the ears and eyebrows or where you want the cap band to sit.
Chest & Bust:  For jackets, and vests, be sure to measure over a shirt or light sweater for the most accurate reading.
                Measure just under the arms and across the chest at the fullest point of the chest.
Waist:  Measure loosely around the waist at the preferred height of waist-band, at the natural waist for most fits or 
                slightly lower for low-rise and bootcut.  If measuring for chaps, measure over a pair of pants or jeans for correct sizing.
Inseam:  Measure along the inner leg from the crotch to the sole of the shoe or boot.
Hip:  Simply measure all the way around the body about 4 inches below the waist catching the broadest part of the hips.
Gloves:  Wrap a tape measure around the fullest part of the hand, excluding the thumb.  Be sure to measure each hand separately,
                and use the largest measurement for sizing.
