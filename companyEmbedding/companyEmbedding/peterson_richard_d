Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Peterson, Richard D carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Peterson, Richard D



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Peterson, Richard D



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Who's Behind Capital Financial?
Richard D. Peterson
CSA, RFP, BA
Send an email to Richard
Richard is President of Capital Financial Group, Inc. located in Akron, Ohio. He first started servicing his clients in April 1982. He is a Registered Financial Planner and a Registered Investment Advisor. Many of his clients are seniors and retirees, so Richard has also earned his Certified Senior Advisor designation to be able to attend to their specific needs.
Richard has been a constant student of his industry by attending industry seminars, educational functions and completing hundreds of  hours of Continuing Education classes. Richard conducts his own workshops and seminars for seniors and they are considered by many to be the most educational and enjoyable seminars around. Richard holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Management from Malone College in Canton, Ohio. He has worked for some of the industry leaders including John Hancock Financial Services and Transamerica Financial Services.
Richard and his wife Donna have two children, Tonya and Ryan. He has resided in the Akron area his entire life and feels that the people are some of the most friendly anywhere. He is an avid jogger, and enjoys the area parks tremendously.
Through the many years of change in the financial industry, Richard decided to make Capital Financial Group Inc. a fee based firm when it came to dealing with securities and investments for his clients. They had voiced their opinion over the years, stating that they preferred to receive unbiased objective advice. They did not like the way  brokers were giving them information about investments which happened to be "products" that they were  selling.
Capital Financial Group Inc. was built on the foundation of offering its valued clients fair, competent, and objective advice. It strives to exceed each of its clients expectations with outstanding services and attention.
This type of strategy involves gathering more information from the client so that an accurate assessment can be made. This allows the client to receive a comprehensive plan that will take into account as many variables as possible to make the plan a precise, accurate, and comprehensive one.

Melissa Kovach
Executive Assistant
 Send an email to Melissa
You can expect a warm and gracious smile when you come into the Capital Financial Group. Melissa is more than happy to answer your questions when you call, or ready to offer a warm cup of coffee when you arrive in person.
Melissa was raised in Medina, OH and now lives in Wadsworth with her husband Chris, and her two children, Morgan and Ronan. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration before becoming a flight attendant with Continental Airlines. After 4 years as a flight attendant, she became a stay-at-home mom.  Now that her children are in school, she is back in the work force in the financial industry.
Melissa is able to assist and help in many different ways. If there is anything you need, you are in good hands with Melissa.

Donna Peterson
Event Director
 Send an email to Donna
Donna is a life long resident of the area and currently lives with her husband in Bath. She enjoys the outdoors, particularly walking in the area parks. She also enjoys spending time with her two children Tonya and Ryan.
Donna is in charge of setting up the seminars and workshops and special events. She is determined to make these events as enjoyable and informative as possible.
