The HMS Income Portfolio HMS’ Income Portfolio strategy is designed to provide current income, while striving to protect the portfolio from the negative effects of inflation.  The portfolio may invest in dividend paying common stocks, preferred stocks, bonds, master limited partnerships, REITs, exchange traded funds, inverse funds, commodities, and cash or money market instruments.  The strategy invests primarily in U.S. securities, but it may invest in global security holdings as well.  Just as we strive to build growth portfolios that are keenly focused on risk control, we also apply our disciplined risk controls to our income portfolios. Given that each investor’s income needs are different, the actual allocation of your income portfolio will depend on your specific income and liquidity needs.  Learn about our other HMS Portfolios:  HMS Stable Risk (Growth & Income) HMS Global Large Cap Growth HMS Global Mid Cap Growth  If you'd like to learn more about how our investment portfolios can help you meet your financial objectives, please click here.

Our Guiding Principles   To provide you with professional, timely unbiased advice, free of any hidden agendas or motivations. To communicate with you in as much detail, and as often as you wish. To never take your business for granted -- that's why we ask you to re-hire us each year. To maximize asset growth at a level of risk with which you are comfortable To anticipate and prepare you to act on whatever challenges or opportunities lie ahead   This firm is built on the foundation of engaged ownership. We view ourselves as your financial advocate. We are an employee owned company, so we have a vested interest in each and every relationship entrusted to us. We put our names on this company for a reason. The work we do for you is important to us. You and your family are important to us. We started this firm because we believe... That our relationship with you should be fair.  You do not have to worry if you are being sold a product. Instead, you enjoy the comfort of having both a financial sounding board and a financial advocate willing to help you make the difficult decisions. The financial industry has lost its focus and is no longer personal. At some point during the past ten years, wealth management became less about the client and more about the institution. We believe you should always be our focus. By getting to know each client’s unique situation we have built successful wealth strategies that help people like you minimize risk without sacrificing return. The greatest opportunities are realized during the worst of times. As we work through the challenges that face us, some companies will be left behind, possibly even entire industries; but others will thrive. We focus our time and resources on helping you take advantage of these challenges. In the power of innovation. It drives our investment process and our results. Our commitment to identifying the current and future drivers of economic growth helps you to enhance your wealth by investing in the future leaders of tomorrow, today. You should be ready for what's next.  The ability to identify whether or not you are being compensated for taking risk is crucial in determining how you should be invested. We are continuously analyzing when it pays you to take risk, the best place in your portfolio to take risk, and how much risk to take in order to meet your goals. If you are successful, then we will be successful. We are even so bold as to ask our clients to hire us for only one year. These core beliefs have resounded strongly with our clients. So strongly, in fact, that many clients have added to their original investments and referred their families and friends to us. To each one of them, we say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to help so many families meet their investment goals, and we look forward to maintaining that tradition for years to come.  If you'd like to learn more about how HMS can help you meet your financial objectives, please click here.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
