Description


 Regenerative medicines have the unique ability to repair, replace and
 regenerate tissues and organs, affected due to some injury, disease or due to
 natural aging process. These medicines are capable of restoring the
 functionality of cells and tissues. These medicines find applicability in wide
 range of degenerative disorders including dermatology, neurodegenerative
 diseases, cardiovascular and orthopedic applications. Researchers are engaged
 in developing technologies based on biologics, genes, somatic as well as stem
 cells.


 The factors driving growth of this market include advancements in stem cell
 therapy, significance of nanotechnology and increasing incidences of
 degenerative diseases. Stem cells have unique ability of proliferation and
 differentiation. These cells can differentiate into any cell lineage. This
 distinctive characteristic of stem cells has made them of significant
 importance in this field. Additionally, the utilization of nano-materials in
 wound care, drug delivery and immunomodulation is opening growth avenues for
 the regenerative medicine market. However, the stringent regulations and the

According to the latest market report published by Persistence Market Research, titled ‘Global Market Study on Regenerative Therapies: Asia Pacific & Japan to Witness Highest Growth by 2022’, the global regenerative therapies market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 20.0% during the forecast period 2016 – 2022.
The market is segmented based on tissue type, application type, end user type, and region. On the basis of tissue type, the overall market has been segmented into allografts, xenografts, and alloplasts. On the basis of application type, the market has been segmented into soft tissue repair, cardiovascular, dental, orthopedic, CNS disease treatment, and others, which include diabetes, autonomous diseases, ocular, and oncology. On the basis of end-user, the market has been segmented into hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and educational institutes. By tissue type, the allografts segment is expected to remain the largest segment, registering the highest CAGR of 22.8% in terms of value, over the forecast period. The long-term effectiveness of the treatment and higher its higher biocompatibility with the patient is expected to contribute to the rise in its popularity over the forecast period. The allografts tissue type segment is expected to reach a market value of US$ 11,633.2 Mn by the end of the forecast period. The allografts tissue is also expected to emerge as the most preferred tissue type for both patients and physicians, globally, over the forecast period. The second most popular tissue type choice is xenografts, which are basically prepared by using various animal tissues.

On the basis of the application type, the market has been segmented into soft tissue repair, cardiovascular, dental, orthopedic, CNS disease treatment, and others (which includes diabetes, autonomous diseases, ocular, and oncology). Currently, a majority of the patients and surgeons globally prefer regenerative therapies for orthopedic, soft tissue repair, and cardiovascular problems.
On the basis of the end user segment type, the market has been segmented into hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and educational institutes. Currently, hospitals are the most preferred option for patients globally.
On the basis of region, the market has been segmented into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific & Japan, and the MEA regions.
Rising per capita healthcare expenditure and contribution to GDP, increasing funding & government support for the development of regenerative therapies, as well as surge in incidences of chronic diseases are major factors driving the growth of the global regenerative therapies market currently.
Other trends driving the market growth include industry maturation, advancements in technology, and increasing demand for long-term results and shorter-time therapeutic procedures by patients. However, the market is expected to observe regulatory re-establishment with an increase in regenerative procedures and standardization of therapies over the forecast period.
The absence of standard regulations and legislations is leading to the invasion of many local players in both the developed and emerging regions. Moreover, high gestation period and time-to-market due to lengthy clinical trials, a large number of product recall within a short span post-approval, and lack of financial-backing by smaller firms are among the major factors hampering the growth of regenerative therapies market currently.
This report assesses trends driving each market segment and offers analysis and insights about the potential of regenerative therapies in specific regions. North America market is estimated to dominate the overall regenerative therapies market, accounting for a maximum value share of the global market by the end of 2016. By 2022, North America and Europe markets are expected to account for over three-fourth revenue share of the global regenerative therapies market. In terms of value, North America is estimated to be the dominant market, expanding at a CAGR of 19.7% over the forecast period.
