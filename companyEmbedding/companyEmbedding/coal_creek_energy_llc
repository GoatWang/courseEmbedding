Carbon Creek Energy | Coal-Bed Methane























































 
 







WHAT IS COAL-BED NATURAL GAS?

123451Without the use of hydraulic fracture stimulation, our natural gas and water flow through a coal seam and into the wellbore.
2Water is pumped up the tubing
3Natural gas rises up the casing
4Natural gas is sent to a compressor station and then sent down a pipeline to consumers.
5Water is released through permitted
outfalls or sent down a pipeline to storage.

QUICK FACTS

LOW EMISSIONS Natural gas emissions are roughly half that of coal emissions when compared on an energy equivalence basis. 

AFFORDABLEFamilies who use natural gas appliances instead of electric appliances spend an average $693 less on cooking, running dryers, heating their homes and water heating. 

RELIABLENatural gas is an abundant, domestic resource that supplies nearly one quarter of the energy used in the United States. 

ZERO HYDRAULIC FRACTURINGUnique to Carbon Creek Energy, our natural gas is produced without the use of hydraulic fracture stimulation.


Click the link below to read a recent article about Carbon Creek’s frac-free approach.


Read the Article
Natural gas exists in coal seams below the earth’s surface.

The chemical properties of coal and methane make methane cling, or adsorb to the coal at the molecule’s surface. The chemical structure of coal allows seven times more methane molecules to occupy coal compared to an equal volume of conventional reservoir rock.

Coal seams have naturally occurring cracks, which means that natural gas flows through coal with greater ease than conventional reservoir rock. However, it also means water can penetrate through the coal – and since water is heavier than gas – the water must be pumped out of the reservoir in order to produce the gas. 

Carbon Creek produces coal-bed natural gas by drilling a well and installing a pump to lift the water off the natural gas. A portion of the water produced is released through permitted outfalls for livestock or wildlife to use. The remainder of the water is sent down a pipeline to storage. The natural gas is gathered by compressor stations and sent down a pipeline for sales. The natural gas goes on to produce electricity, fuel natural gas vehicles and heat people’s homes.


HOW CLEAN IS THE WATER?
The water released in our outfalls is near EPA drinking water quality standards and it meets criteria for livestock and wildlife watering. In fact, the water from our outfalls is cleaner than the receiving waters at all release points.

Responsible Water Management

Carbon Creek is committed to protecting our environment. This is how we practice responsible water management:






The WDEQ has set water quality standards and compliance requirements to protect the state’s water quality.









The WDEQ has granted Carbon Creek permits to release water. The permits outline the state’s standards and requirements.









Carbon Creek conducts water sampling and reporting in accordance with the permits issued by the WDEQ.









The WDEQ evaluates compliance and permits Carbon Creek to release the water, so long as the state’s standards are upheld.






WHAT IS AN OUTFALL?Outfalls allow Carbon Creek to recycle water in drilling operations, provide drinking water to livestock through stock tanks, irrigate the surrounding land through center pivots, and create reservoirs.


By working with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), we’ve been permitted to construct outfalls. These outfalls are the mechanism by which we create value with this water for livestock, wildlife and agriculture producers.


121
Outfalls can be in the form of water tanks to provide drinking water to livestock.
2
Reservoir outfalls also provide water for growing crops


 At Carbon Creek, we want to be a vital asset to our surroundings. We are committed to our environment, community, and economy.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus!

I like the taste ! but bI don't drink energy drunk too often. That's why I'm not going to purchase the product.  But I do recommend people to try and  then they can decide for themselves.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!

Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.

The energy drink is great to drink in the morning to get rid of the grogginess after a late night. I doesn't bring you up as high as caffeine, but it settles in with your current mood as a stabilizer.

Having only tried this once in my life, i was shocked at how well it tasted! It didn't feel super heavy with sugars and carbs like alot of energy drinks can feel like after consuming. I let my coworker try some, he said he really enjoyed how well it tasted. I would probably purchase in the future.

I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!

Honestly, I much rather drink this organic energy drink rather then regular energy drinks any day! However, I do not normally drink energy drinks.

Brotin D.
California





I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

When it comes to energy drinks, I always prefer to have a more natural drink. With the chemicals and fake flavor of many competitors, this is definitely a healthy alternative to give you that boost you need in your day.  This drink did not give my an amped up feeling or jitters, which I always appreciate. It honestly is a drink I would purchase again. I hope this can pops up on more stores' shelves.

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I'm not big on mainstream energy drinks, so I'm happy that there's a more natural organic variation. I probably won't drink a ton of them, but I would probably try to convert people from drinking big brand energy drinks to drinking GURU. I was happy to find the product provided being sold at Sprouts.

Jasmine C.

I really enjoyed drinking this energy drink, i love how it has only 10 calories! Everyone should try this organic, vegan and non-gmo drink. Why isn't this the new thing ? Gatorade should not be the energy drink people chose.  I loved how it boosted me up when I'm trying to get things done without having to worry about the down fall.

I think i would buy it again but im not the type to rely on energy drinks i just wanted to try it to be honest.

I was a bit hesitant to try an energy drink as I'd heard some of them make people jittery or make their heart race as side effects. But I decided to give this one a try. I drank this on a day of work that I knew would be busy, and it definitely made a difference. I felt very energetic, and I luckily didn't get any bad side effects. It tasted very good too. Would definitely recommend!

I usually don't buy energy drink but this one was great.  So glad it was vegan as well because it's hard to find vegan drinks and foods sometimes.  It's definitely worth trying and I will recommend to friends or family members who are bug energy drinkers.

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

Guru Organic Energy Drink is delicious. I was not overwhelmed with carbonation like other energy drinks. I felt good and ready to conquer my chores. It was a good, clean energy.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce. Guru engery drinks did the job for when I needed an extra boost. As far as taste go I find it similar to the other drinks I had before. If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

My husband has been gluten-free for almost two years and while I do blend my own gluten-free flour at times, sometimes I'm just pressed for time and looking for an off-the-shelf GF flour that acts like regular flour.

I will definitely buy this brand again when I need GF flour in a hurry!

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

Guru Organic Energy Drink was very delicious and has natural Caffeine and since trying it, I have become a repeat customer and I also tell my co-workers If they want a 'Natural Energy Drink' with just the right amount of Caffeine that GURU doesn't give you the jitters, and it is Vegan of course and I totally recommend Guru, so please give it a try and I'm sure you'll also become a fan! I really Enjoy the Fruity Taste, and my co-workers see that I'm drinking GURU, and they start asking me about it. Haha, now my friends are also purchasing GURU, and I'm glad to say that they learned about it from me which makes me Happy! I am definitely a True GURU Fan, and *If you want more Information on GURU Organic Energy Drink(They Also Have a "Lite" version)Just Hashtag: #trynatural and #gotitfree ,

I don't usually drink energy drinks because of all the artificial ingredients but I liked Guru because it's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains healthy  ingredients like Guarana and Green Tea. There was no initial energy jolt and no hard crash, did not experience any brain fog either.  A little bit too sweet for me but my son liked it, he usually drinks Monster Zero.

I don't drink energy drinks often. I've tried some other brands of regular energy drinks, but this drink tasted the best out of all of the ones i've tried. Not only is it healthier for you because it is organic,  but the taste is very light and refreshing whereas regular energy drinks taste heavy. The combination so ingredients makes this drink taste very delicious. This drink is definitely effective in terms of sustaining energy. I highly recommend this drink.

Guru Energy Drink is one of a kind. This drink smells great. The taste is a little on the bitter side. This is my personal opinion. It does have echinacea flower extract, in which I do like. I feel an organic energy and no jitters at all. I like this drink. It is an acquired taste though.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I easily found this at the store. I opted for the original. When I got home I immediately put it in my chiller so that I could try it right away. I didn't even read the can. I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I got the Lite version & kind of wish I got original instead. On the positive side: it certainly did not have the artificial sugary or metallic lingering taste like red bull or rock star or monster did. It also did keep me energized so thats a plus. 
However, this version had a light soda taste that was kind of fruity (which I am personally not fond of).

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption. You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.
When I need an energy drink again, I will definitely buy this one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming.

I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

I liked this because of the results.  The taste is okay and I tried it at room temperature and cold and I would recommend drinking it cold.  I started to feel the effects within 30 minutes and I definitely had more awake and had energy.  I did not a hard come down and was still able to rest that evening.  I will use this again.

I drink energy drinks often. I drink coffee daily.  With that being said,  guru is pretty good.  I didn't get the jitters like i usually do when trying a new drink for the first time,  so that was a definite plus.  It provided a nice energy boost.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste. I made the mistake of getting the Lite, so it's my fault but it taste 2 just like anything else that's considered "light", like it's missing an ingredient or mage with fake sugar.  Overall I was satisfied.

Ive never been a big fan of any energy drink so I didn't have high hopes for this product, but to my surprise, it has a great taste and it really gave me the boost that I needed. I had it in the morning before I left for school and by the late evening, I was still pumped. Im not sure if it's the drink, but I was in a good mood that day. I'm not too sure if I would purchase it on my own since I'm not big on energy drinks, but I would highly recommend it for people who likes energy drinks or for a pre-workout drink.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

Surprisingly good!  I wasn't expecting this drink to be (lightly) carbonated....it was a nice surprise!  Flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy.

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Midday and I just ate too much for lunch and all I wanted to do was take a nap. It was a perfect time to give Guru a try.

Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it!

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised!

I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink. It tastes a bit better than Red Bull but the crashes are way weaker. The price is cheaper than red bull. There are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks. All in all, 10/10 would buy again.

This has to be the best energy drink that I have ever tasted. It is a light crisp, tangy citrus flavor that doesn't have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.
I liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where I can buy it in the future. I don't usually shop at Sprouts or Whole Foods so this would only be something I would get when I rarely make it into those stores.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation. Guru Organic Energy Drink was a nice surprise, because the carbonation isn't that bad - I actually let it sit a little and it got a lot better. The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this. He said it gave him more energy without the sugar-y crash that others give him after a couple of hours. This definitely worked for him & I felt better knowing that it has better ingredients for him. I was really against him drinking energy drinks, but thankful that this product is a lot safer for him. I would recommend this product to any & all energy drinkers.

The drink was very cool and refreshing with a taste similar to redbull. I felt energized but didn't experience any crash or over-hype.

I definitely recommend trying once if you regularly consume energy drinks.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option. 
I'm definitely buying it again, and I'm recommending it to both friends and family. It is a product of great quality and great flavor. It delivers what it promises and I'm a happy consumer.

There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day.

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor. It has like a light fruit taste, almost like a carbonated flavored water/juice, and is really not too sweet. It taste real unique and is made with all natural ingredients. I like it, I would definitely recommend this product to help support the immune system. #trynatural

I enjoyed the flavor of the Original flavor very much. I drank it at the start of my day to determine whether it would give me energy. It did, but I still needed a full cup of coffee about an hour later.  Probably best when needed just a bit more energy but not a full load.

I'm not normally an energy drink person.  I always worry that they are too unhealthy.  This one has good ingredients.  Sweetened with stevia.  The taste is nice and it didn't leave me feeling jittery or shaky like I thought it might.  Overall good drink.  A little too sweet for my taste, which is the only reason that I gave it a 4.

I like all the features GURU has but it has interesting taste. I wouldn't say that it is my favorite flavor. This is the only issue I have with GURU energy drink. I recommended it already to most of my friends because some of them really like energy drinks and they drink a lot. So, instead of buying energy drinks that causes health problems, it is better to get an organic one. Nice product overall.

I am highly recommending the Guru Natural Energy Drink.  I really liked the fact that it is organic, vegan, gluten free and only has five calories per can.  I did not experience any jitteriness, shakiness or nervousness using this energy drink.  I really like the natural occurring caffeine as it gave me energy without the usual side effects of other energy drinks.  I was also very impressed with the taste of this energy drink.  No gross after taste.  I really enjoyed this energy drink and I have purchased it.  I highly recommend.

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

So I love the fact that this energy drink is organic. That is the best thing about it. I only had the one for sampling so I did give me a boost when i needed it and doesn't taste harsh like some of the other energy drinks I have tasted. Some are too sweet or not sweet enough and I think this one was balanced, but that is just my opinion. I liked it but the best things are that its vegan gluten free non gmo and it comes in light for those counting calories

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

I am surprised that this didn't taste as bad as most energy drinks. I try to avoid energy drinks unless I really need to have one. To me, it's a 4 star product because I wouldn't grab it if I was shopping in the store unless I was really in the need for it. It's not that bad but it's not something I would put in my body every time I need an energy boost. I am trying to be more "whole food, clean eating" type of person.  I would recommend this to others though!

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

This is the best energy drink that I have ever had and I have tried all of them.  This not only gave me energy, but it tasted great.  This brand gave me just enough energy.  I didn't give me jitters, which I can ad do appreciate.  Try this drink if you need a little pep in your step.

I am use to drinking energy drinks that most are accustom to, but this drink surely surprised me.  I was thinking that this would not be as good as the one I drink mostly.  Do you know that this drink tasted better?  I was pleasantly surprised that this drink was not only great tasting, but gave me the energy that I needed.  I wish I knew about this brand sooner as it seems that I am always the last to know about great products.

I couldn't personally try it due to being pregnant and not having much caffeine, so I gave it to my husband to try. Took him a bit to get use to the flavor. He's use red bull and monster. I got him the original and it seemed to give him great energy. Will buy more for his long and early work days. We got the original since my husband hates anything "lite". I look forward to having one later.

Clean. Crisp. Refreshing. It's a clean energy drink without all the added junk, and it actually tastes pretty good. The flavor isn't amazing but it's still good. If I want an energy drink I'd go for something like this.

I'm so glad I found this energy drink. I can so appreciate that it does not include horrible sweeteners like aspertame or splenda. I also prefer the taste of the drink over the taste of Monster or Rockstar. I also really love that it doesn't give me the jitters that those other popular drinks do. I felt the energy, but it was a smooth increase of energy...not something that made me feel sick or anxious. I would totally recommend.

I appreciated the chance to try this drink. It's great to have a healthier organic alternative without the additives & artificial flavours that are part of many energy drinks.  I found it very refreshing, with just enough sweetness. It did increase my energy somewhat without making me feel overly amped up. I also love that it's vegan & non-GMO. The only reason that I wouldn't buy it as frequently is because I found the taste a little strong, but it's a good product that I plan to drink occasionally.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

Ive never tried an organic energy drink before. I liked that it was low in calories and was a natural energy drink. I liked that it didnt make me crash because the caffeine was naturally occurring. I thought it tasted pretty good, I drank it cold straight from the can. I found this at Sprouts. They had a regular and lite version of this drink.

When I first came across this product I was a bit skeptical since I have tried several other energy drinks and have had a horrible withdrawal experience. This was my first time trying an organic energy drink and it was great! The taste is wonderful along with the energy boost I needed. It did not make me feel jittery nor did I crash. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for either a healthier alternative or just needs a quick boost.

I purchased the original 12 oz Guru . I had to purchase the original due to the sweetener used in the lite. This energy drink had a great taste to it . I read all the ingredients before drinking and was confident I was drinking something better for me. Comparitive to other energy drinks this was the only one I could drink .  I drank this on a day when I had no coffee and it did the job of my coffee .

Sometimes even the healthiest and most conscious of foodies wants to imbibe in a 'naughty' energy drink in a can,   Really cool that Guru has an organic alternative.  I couldn't be happier for this option to arrive!  Sadly I usually only buy things on sale, but I am definitely going to keep my eyes peeled for when they are so I can stock up on some more.  =D

Loved it. What's great about GURU is that it's not full of crap. And by that I mean pretty much everything in a RedBull. I love Redbull though, wait no, I love the IDEA of Redbull and that's exactly what GURU is! All the benefits without the toxicity.  I will always grab these now instead of the Redbull. I care about my health!

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.
