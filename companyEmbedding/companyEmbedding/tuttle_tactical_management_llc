Bond alternative designed to be less subject to interest rate risk






June 10, 2015 11:39 AM Eastern Daylight Time



STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Tuttle Tactical Management, in conjunction with ETF 
      Issuer Solutions, launches the Tuttle 
      Tactical Management Multi-Strategy Income ETF (NASDAQ: TUTI). This is 
      the second ETF from Tuttle Tactical Management, following the launch of 
      the Tuttle Tactical Management US Core ETF (NASDAQ: TUTT) in February.
    


      The new ETF is designed to deliver portfolio income, while providing the 
      investor tactically managed exposure to the markets. Etfis Capital, a 
      sister company to ETF Issuer Solutions, is the advisor to the fund and 
      Tuttle Tactical Management is the fund sub-advisor. The rules-based ETF 
      will leverage Tuttle Tactical Management’s four uncorrelated tactical 
      models:
    


Income Relative Momentum Model consists of one or more Income 
        Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) based on relative strength determined 
        on a monthly basis.
      

Dividend Counter-Trend Model invests primarily in 
        dividend-paying equity securities when short-term (daily) market 
        models trending downwards, and cash or cash equivalents when 
        short-term (daily) models show markets trending upwards.
      

Dividend Tactical Fundamental Earnings Model invests in a 
        portfolio of Dividend ETPs when intermediate (weekly) models show 
        stock markets are generally trending upwards and earnings are 
        generally trending downwards, and cash and cash-equivalents during 
        periods when the Sub-Adviser’s intermediate (weekly) models show stock 
        markets are generally trending downwards and earnings are generally 
        trending upwards.
      

Dividend Absolute Momentum Model invests in Dividend ETPs when 
        the intermediate (weekly) models show stock markets are trending 
        upwards, and the invests in cash, cash equivalents or ETPs holding 
        fixed-income securities during periods when intermediate (weekly) 
        models show markets are trending downwards, in accordance with the 
        their relative strength.
      


      Matthew Tuttle, CEO and portfolio manager of Tuttle Tactical Management, 
      LLC offers, “Income investors need a combination of yield and capital 
      gains, and most cannot afford living off of only yield while seeing 
      their principal erode. The bond market remains challenging for 
      investors, and we know that interest rates will rise. The need for 
      income investing strategies that can allocate tactically in the face of 
      increasingly complex market conditions is clear. We believe that this 
      ETF is debuting at a critical time for income-minded investors.”
    

      Tuttle, a regular speaker at industry conferences, will be speaking 
      broadly about tactical investing at the Expert Series ETF Managed 
      Portfolio Summit in Chicago on June 10.
    

      “There is no doubt that the industry appetite for tactical solutions has 
      picked up, and we have seen a strong initial interest in our first ETF 
      product as well as interest in hearing our views on the subject of 
      tactical investing at these industry events,” explains Tuttle.
    

      William J. Smalley, President of ETF Issuer Solutions, said, “Following 
      the success of Matthew’s first ETF, the Tuttle Tactical U.S. Core ETF 
      (TUTT), we’re very happy to have added TUTI to our listing of featured 
      managers.”

DISCLOSURE


Please carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, 
      charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information 
      about the Tuttle Tactical, call (212) 593-4383 or visit www.tuttlefunds.com 
      for a prospectus. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.


      An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks; therefore you 
      may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that 
      the Fund will be successful in meeting their investment objectives. 
      Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are 
      not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will 
      reduce returns. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher 
      volatility.
    

      The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed 
      portfolio. There are additional risks associated with portfolio 
      turnover. As a result of its trading strategy, the Fund may sell 
      portfolio securities without regard to the length of time they have been 
      held and will likely have a higher portfolio turnover rate than other 
      registered investment companies.
    

      Fixed Income Risks: Risks of investments in fixed income securities 
      include, without limitation, credit risk, interest rate risk, maturity 
      risk, yield curve risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk. These risks 
      could affect the value of investments of the Fund, possibly causing the 
      Fund’s share price and total return to be reduced and fluctuate more 
      than other types of investments.
    

      Junk Bonds or High Yield Securities Risk: High yield securities and 
      unrated securities of similar credit quality are considered to be 
      speculative with respect to the issuer’s continuing ability to make 
      principal and interest payments and are generally subject to greater 
      levels of credit quality risk, liquidity risk, and price volatility risk 
      than investment grade securities.
    

      Allocation Risk: The Fund’s particular allocations may have a 
      significant effect on the Fund’s performance. Allocation risk is the 
      risk that the Fund’s allocation among the ETFs and other securities in 
      which it invests will cause the Fund to underperform other funds with a 
      similar investment objective that do not allocate their investments in 
      the same manner.
    

      The Fund may invest in ETFs or other investment companies. Through its 
      positions in ETFs and other investment companies, the Fund will be 
      subject to the risks associated with such vehicles’ investments, 
      including the possibility that the value of the securities or 
      instruments held by an ETF or other investment company could decrease 
      (or increase).
    

      The Fund's investment adviser is Etfis Capital LLC, and its investment 
      sub-adviser is Tuttle Tactical Management, LLC
    

      Distributed by ETF Distributors LLC (Member: FINRA), and an 
      affiliate of Etfis Capital LLC.

Tuttle Tactical Management to Launch Inaugural ETF




Industry Leader in Trend Aggregation Investing to Bring Tactical 
      “ETF of ETFs” to Market






February 25, 2015 09:33 AM Eastern Standard Time



STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today ETF 
      Issuer Solutions launches The Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core 
      Exchange-Traded-Fund (NASDAQ: TUTT) with Tuttle 
      Tactical Management acting as sub-adviser. TUTT is an ETF which 
      seeks long-term capital appreciation while maintaining a secondary 
      emphasis on capital preservation, primarily through investments in the 
      U.S. equity market. The Fund is an “ETF of ETFs” that seeks to provide 
      attractive returns during market upturns while maintaining the ability 
      to protect capital during market downturns by employing a 
      multi-strategy, tactically-managed exposure to U.S. equity markets.
    


      The tactical nature of the Fund’s objective is a pre-determined strategy 
      which, while active, reacts to market indicators rather than attempts to 
      use them as predictors of market direction. Under normal market 
      conditions, the Fund will invest not less than 80% of its total assets 
      in shares of exchange-traded products listed on U.S. exchanges. The 
      total annual fund operating expenses will be 1.34%.
    

      Tuttle Tactical Management, LLC, the Fund’s investment sub-adviser, 
      manages the assets using a tactical approach premised on the following 
      principles of the Sub-Adviser’s investment philosophy:
    


        Markets move in recognizable short and intermediate-term trends and 
        countertrends
      

        Over the intermediate term, strong asset classes tend to stay strong, 
        while weak asset classes tend to continue in weakness
      

        Over the shorter term, markets are dominated by media noise, fear and 
        similar short-term disruptions and concerns.
      


      TUTT will take advantage of this with the use of four types of 
      strategies: an S&P 500 Momentum Model, which works to track the S&P 500 
      when it is trending upwards, a Relative Strength Equity Model, which 
      will weight towards a sector based on its relative strength, a Beta 
      Opportunities Model, which will allocate assets using methods other than 
      market capitalization and as well allocate to low-risk instruments 
      during a downtrend, and a counter trend model which looks to buy into 
      market weakness and sell into market strength.
    

      Matthew Tuttle, CEO and portfolio manager of Tuttle Tactical Management, 
      LLC offers, “We’ve developed TUTT in order to offer investors what they 
      really want----the chance to make money in up markets while protecting 
      against loss in down markets.”
    

      William J. Smalley, President of ETF Issuer Solutions, said, “We’re very 
      happy to have added TUTT and Matthew to our listing of featured 
      managers. As of now, there is no single envoy of tactical investing, 
      and we think that the Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core ETF can serve 
      that purpose.”

      Issuer Solutions, launches the Tuttle 
      Tactical Management Multi-Strategy Income ETF (NASDAQ: TUTI). This is

        periods when the Sub-Adviser’s intermediate (weekly) models show stock 
        markets are generally trending downwards and earnings are generally 
        trending upwards.
      

Dividend Absolute Momentum Model invests in Dividend ETPs when 
        the intermediate (weekly) models show stock markets are trending 
        upwards, and the invests in cash, cash equivalents or ETPs holding 
        fixed-income securities during periods when intermediate (weekly) 
        models show markets are trending downwards, in accordance with the 
        their relative strength.
      


      Matthew Tuttle, CEO and portfolio manager of Tuttle Tactical Management, 
      LLC offers, “Income investors need a combination of yield and capital 
      gains, and most cannot afford living off of only yield while seeing 
      their principal erode. The bond market remains challenging for 
      investors, and we know that interest rates will rise. The need for 
      income investing strategies that can allocate tactically in the face of 
      increasingly complex market conditions is clear. We believe that this 
      ETF is debuting at a critical time for income-minded investors.”
    

      Tuttle, a regular speaker at industry conferences, will be speaking 
      broadly about tactical investing at the Expert Series ETF Managed 
      Portfolio Summit in Chicago on June 10.
    

      “There is no doubt that the industry appetite for tactical solutions has 
      picked up, and we have seen a strong initial interest in our first ETF 
      product as well as interest in hearing our views on the subject of 
      tactical investing at these industry events,” explains Tuttle.
    

      William J. Smalley, President of ETF Issuer Solutions, said, “Following 
      the success of Matthew’s first ETF, the Tuttle Tactical U.S. Core ETF 
      (TUTT), we’re very happy to have added TUTI to our listing of featured 
      managers.”

DISCLOSURE


Please carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, 
      charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information 
      about the Tuttle Tactical, call (212) 593-4383 or visit www.tuttlefunds.com 
      for a prospectus. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.


      An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks; therefore you 
      may lose money by investing in the Fund. There can be no assurance that 
      the Fund will be successful in meeting their investment objectives. 
      Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are 
      not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will 
      reduce returns. Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher 
      volatility.
    

      The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed 
      portfolio. There are additional risks associated with portfolio 
      turnover. As a result of its trading strategy, the Fund may sell 
      portfolio securities without regard to the length of time they have been 
      held and will likely have a higher portfolio turnover rate than other 
      registered investment companies.
    

      Fixed Income Risks: Risks of investments in fixed income securities 
      include, without limitation, credit risk, interest rate risk, maturity 
      risk, yield curve risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk. These risks 
      could affect the value of investments of the Fund, possibly causing the 
      Fund’s share price and total return to be reduced and fluctuate more 
      than other types of investments.
    

      Junk Bonds or High Yield Securities Risk: High yield securities and 
      unrated securities of similar credit quality are considered to be 
      speculative with respect to the issuer’s continuing ability to make 
      principal and interest payments and are generally subject to greater 
      levels of credit quality risk, liquidity risk, and price volatility risk 
      than investment grade securities.
    

      Allocation Risk: The Fund’s particular allocations may have a 
      significant effect on the Fund’s performance. Allocation risk is the 
      risk that the Fund’s allocation among the ETFs and other securities in 
      which it invests will cause the Fund to underperform other funds with a 
      similar investment objective that do not allocate their investments in 
      the same manner.
    

      The Fund may invest in ETFs or other investment companies. Through its 
      positions in ETFs and other investment companies, the Fund will be 
      subject to the risks associated with such vehicles’ investments, 
      including the possibility that the value of the securities or 
      instruments held by an ETF or other investment company could decrease 
      (or increase).
    

      The Fund's investment adviser is Etfis Capital LLC, and its investment 
      sub-adviser is Tuttle Tactical Management, LLC
    

      Distributed by ETF Distributors LLC (Member: FINRA), and an 
      affiliate of Etfis Capital LLC.

	ADVISORY, July 7, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

What: 

	Tuttle Tactical Management, LLC (Tuttle) will visit the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square. Tuttle is an industry leader in Trend Aggregation providing Investment Advisers, Financial Planners, Insurance Agents and their clients with proven and customized tactical ETF-based investment strategies and exclusive asset management.

	Tuttle listed the Tuttle Tactical Management U.S. Core ETF (Symbol: TUTT) on The Nasdaq Stock Market on February 25, 2015.

Under normal market conditions, TUTT invests not less than 80% of its total assets in shares of ETPs listed on U.S. exchanges. The total annual fund operating expenses is 1.34%.

	Tuttle also listed the Tuttle Tactical Management Multi Strategy Income ETF (Symbol:TUTI) on the Nasdaq Stock Market on June 10, 2015. This is a tactical income strategy designed to provide income while protecting from rising rates.

	In honor of the occasion, Matthew Tuttle, Founder, will ring the Closing Bell.

Where:

	Nasdaq MarketSite – 4 Times Square – 43rd & Broadway – Broadcast Studio
