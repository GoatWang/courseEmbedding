Managing Director


Biography
During his 15-year entrepreneurial career in the high-tech industry, Fahri repeatedly demonstrated his savvy in conceiving compelling value propositions and building high-tech organizations to successfully execute aggressive business plans. Having joined Sigma Partners in late 2006, Fahri applies his expertise by identifying strong entrepreneurs with good ideas to help build disruptive, market-leading companies.
Background
Fahri was the Founder, President, and CEO of Qtera Corporation, which he led to become the leading provider of ultra-long-haul photonic networking solutions. Nortel Networks acquired the company for $3.25 billion, and Fahri continued to lead Qtera as President of the wholly-owned subsidiary until 2001. Before founding Qtera, Fahri was a member of the executive team at Siemens where he helped establish and manage the company’s Optical Networks business unit in North America, which was later spun-off as Optisphere Networks. Prior to joining Siemens, Fahri led Pirelli’s pioneering activities in the optical amplifier and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) markets. The optical systems division of Pirelli was later acquired by Cisco Systems for $2.15 billion. Just prior to joining Sigma, Fahri founded Concept Ventures in 2005 by acquiring a portion of the assets of Applied Materials Ventures in which he served as Managing Director.Fahri is the proprietor of Skipstone Ranch, a sustainable wine and olive oil estate in California’s Sonoma County.
Education
A native of Cyprus, Fahri came to the United States in 1985 on an academic scholarship to the Florida Institute of Technology, where he earned his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering. Fahri holds five patents in the field of fiber optics and optical communications.

Plume - Product Hunt





























Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured a year agoPlumeSmall pods that brings reliable WiFi to every roomHomeInternet of ThingsWi-Fi+ 1get it1040 ShareFeatured commentFahri Diner@fdiner · CEO, PlumeExcited to share news from Plume today! 

I’m the founder and CEO and we’ve been working to bring the concept of Adaptive WiFi to market. 

Plume rethinks home Wi-Fi by removing the need for a traditional router, offering a completely new system for people wanting fast and consistent connectivity in every corner of their homes.
 
Plume works through a set of beautiful Pods designed to plug directly into wall sockets around the home – one Pod per room is recommended. Directed by the Plume Cloud, the Pods offer coverage, speed and reliability far beyond any other solution. Plume is smarter, faster, smaller and simpler to set up.

Plume Pods are $39 each during pre-sale and come in three colors: Champagne, Silver or Onyx. Those that purchase during the pre-sale period will be first to receive their Pods on launch in the fall, when the price will rise to $49. 25Share·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@fdiner what's the range of one of the 'pods' ? 5Share·a year agoÖzgür Celebi@tristancelebi · iOS Developer@fdiner How does plume connect to the Internet, with my Provider?

UpvoteShare·a year agoFahri Diner@fdiner · CEO, Plume@_jacksmith we think of it as one Pod per room, rather than a specific range. So far in our testing this model is working in typical US homes.

UpvoteShare·a year agoWould you recommend Plume to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHFahri DinerMakersMFahri DinerDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.Jack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup AdviserThis seems interesting and with interesting tech. Great design. It's a shame about the minimum order # of 6 units though, as a small studio or 1 bed likely wouldn't need that amount.

I tried out Eero but ultimately couldn't justify the price. My current setup is a mesh networked setup using OpenMesh base units. I networked my entire ~2000 sqr foot apartment using 3 base units for ~$100 (half the cost of 1x AP from Eero).

Open Mesh does have a steeper technical curve (Eero was quite plug and play) and Eero did make my network a lot faster, but I just couldn't justify paying $499 for 3 APs. 26Share·a year agoEric Metelka@eric3000 · Product Manager, PowerReviews@_jacksmith A small studio or 1 bed likely isn't their target customer 11Share·a year agoAndreas Mitschke@andmitsch · I own a computer@eric3000 @_jacksmith Agree, this is more the target for those who want to substitute multiple repeaters. 2Share·a year agoE.T.Cook@etc@_jacksmith Might want to check out unifi sometime as well. UpvoteShare·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@etc I've had Unifi at a previous office. I think there's a bit more of a learning curve in terms of setup. Also for a housing environment, the open mesh devices that I have are about 1/4 or 1/3rd the size of the Unifi devices. So much more discreet. They're also cheaper. UpvoteShare·a year agoE.T.Cook@etc@_jacksmith Are you sure that's still the case? From what I see, the Unifi APs (AC Pro) are half the price of their Open Mesh equivalents. ($120 vs $225) The Open Mesh software is definitely more capable through the interface, but Unifi does have some interesting features, including zero handoff and effective band steering. Not advocating either solution - but I've been pretty happy with the solution after testing out a few alternatives. Thanks for the feedback! UpvoteShare·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@etc I got some of APs that they had on sale or something, so were only $35 each. I think they still sell them, they run only on the 5ghz channel, not 2.4ghz. They also have band steering in the beta version of their firmware.

I'd say the size is the main impact though. The Unifi APs would look stupid in my place. The tiny open mesh APs are really discreet even if I just put them in the corridor.

For business id recommend Unifi. For home maybe open mesh; or this plume thing if it's any good.

Eero is the best that I tried if money is no issue and you just want the best speed. UpvoteShare·a year agoFahri DinerMaker@fdiner · CEO, Plume@_jacksmith The 6-Pod minimum is during the pre-order period only. A 1-bed with kitchen plus dining/living will likely do just fine with a pack of 3. UpvoteShare·a year agoFahri DinerMaker@fdiner · CEO, PlumeExcited to share news from Plume today!

How does this compare to eero, @fdiner? 8Share·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@rrhoover the main difference would seem to be the larger number of access points and the "Auto channel hop", which sounds quite innovative. 4Share·a year agoAvery Haskell@averyhaskell · Stanford Computer Science@rrhoover Seconded UpvoteShare·a year agoDhruba Adhikari@acpmasquerade · Product Director, Picovico@_jacksmith @rrhoover Also the price per unit seems to be much cheaper. UpvoteShare·a year agoJack Smith@_jacksmith · Serial Entrepreneur & Startup Adviser@acpmasquerade but that becomes irrelevant if you need 6 Plume's to = 2x Eeros. But yeah, if you're getting 6x for ~$250, then that's likely potentially cheaper overall UpvoteShare·a year agoDhruba Adhikari@acpmasquerade · Product Director, Picovico@_jacksmith Yup, either way its cheaper even when Eeros require you to buy 3 units, Plume wants 6. Apart from that Plume claims to have worked on protocol layer as well. UpvoteShare·a year agoFahri DinerMaker@fdiner · CEO, PlumeGreat question @rrhoover!

While the latest generation of multi-router systems improve signal strength, they can choke overall system capacity and speeds. They are based on decades-old technology - mesh - that compounds the issue of a central router and cannot handle the complex variables and loads affecting a WiFi network in a modern connected home.

We haven’t built Plume on mesh technology as it can’t, for example, support even a simple thing like allowing each access point to use a different channel.

A Plume network constantly self optimizes. It switches channels based on external interference, intelligently hands off mobile devices from room to room, and can even boost bandwidth to a certain part of the house based on knowing how a device is being used. A basic mesh system focused solely on signal coverage can’t do that.

That’s why we uncoupled the compute part of the router and put it in the cloud, and let all the important decisions be made there. It means our Pods can be smaller and cheaper, while the unlimited power of the Plume Cloud can intelligently monitor your home WiFi and adapt accordingly.

We benchmarked Plume against practically everything on the market – no other solution comes close. 13Share·a year agoVinay Patankar@vinayp10 · CEO, Process Street, AngelPad Alum@_jacksmith @acpmasquerade @rrhoover it's not much more than the Google OnHub and it seems it would get better coverage as i've lived in long apartments where the OnHub wouldn't quite reach to the other side.. UpvoteShare·a year agoAdam Gering@adamgering · CEO of Uncommon Social@fdiner @rrhoover Uh oh. That sounds very innovative, putting intelligence in the cloud, but risky if it's required to operate. This means the WiFi network could stop working upon loss of WAN connectivity?? And also if Plume discontinues service for any reason (end of life, out of business, acquired, etc)??? 1Share·a year agoFahri DinerMaker@fdiner · CEO, Plume@adamgering @rrhoover Good question. If WAN goes down (completely), Plume remembers the most recent configuration, and your WiFi network continues to operate  for your local devices like printers, etc.  If WAN slows down, Plume optimization keeps on ticking. While we all love to hate our ISP, the reality is most of them today do a great job of keeping broadband up - https://www.fcc.gov/reports-rese.... And the upstream network resources (compute, storage, etc.) have very high availability figures - https://cloudharmony.com/status. So bottom line - no worries. 2Share·a year agoKumar Thangudu@datarade · TechnologistWhy isn't wi-fi reliable? 

I'd like to understand why from an analog RF Design engineer's perspective as well as try to understand how Plume arbitrages a multi-billion dollar business with tons of electrical engineers who try to build high performance products. 

What is it that the key players are all missing out on that your startup understands? 
As in, what's the trade-off? 

I think deep problems and solutions require deep context. 6Share·a year agoDieter Shirley@dete73 · Old Salt, Axiom Zen@datarade From what I can tell, Plume is doing a couple of interesting things that most other folks aren't trying:
 - many more small antennas, more widely spaced; I think a lot of routers start from the assumption that you need to optimize the case for a single base-station. Plume starts from the assumption that you have one antenna per room.
 - compute in the cloud. The entire system's configuration is constantly being adapted via the cloud analysis. @fdiner talk above how the individual antennas change their channel, but the interesting part is that those channel choices are being driven holistically for the whole system, and not each antenna trying to optimize individually.

At the end of the day, we'll have to see how it plays out in the real world, but the WiFi situation in a lot of places (including both my home and my office) is not "solved". Maybe Plume hasn't solved it either, but it's a novel new approach that looks more radical than all the other attempts I've seen (including Eero). I'd have an order in already if they shipped to Canada! 1Share·a year agoFahri DinerMaker@fdiner · CEO, Plume@datarade wireless in general, and WiFi in particular (an unlicensed spectrum) is an indeterministic medium - the environment constantly changes due to varying loads, congestion, interference, fading, etc. Current offerings are largely "fixed" solutions trying to solve a "varying" problem. The result today, as the sum of the two, is a varying, inconsistent quality of experience. Plume is a dynamic, adaptive, self-optimizing approach that's intended to offer a constant, high quality of experience. We leverage the amazing work the industry is doing in the silicon and RF level - Plume's technical contributions to the industry are largely in software, algorithms, data intelligence, machine learning, and massively scalable cloud architectures to help improve [home] WiFi. 1Share·a year agoView more comments👋 Welcome to Product HuntGet the best new products in your inbox, daily.SubscribeRelated ProductseeroBlanket your home in  fast, reliable WiFieero Beacon & eero PlusWiFi so good, you'll never think about WiFi againYourOwnMapsBeautiful, minimalistic custom map postersGatherThe minimal, modular organizer that cuts through the clutterPulseFall asleep in 60 seconds with this innovative breathing appShapeScaleA scale that digitizes your body in photorealistic 3D! 💪PreferProfessionals you need, from people you knowFeatherModern-day furniture rentals for millennials and startups flag
