Product Description
James P.O’Shaughnessy – What Works on Wall Street

 
“O’Shaughnessy’s conclusion that some strategies do produce consistently strong results while others underperform could shake up the investment business.”
―Barron’s
“What Works on Wall Street is indisputably a major contribution to empirical research on the behavior of common stocks in the United States. . . . Conceivably, the influence of What Works on Wall Streetwill prove immense.”
―The Financial Analysts’ Journal
“O’Shaughnessy’s latest, What Works on Wall Street, is a serious inquiry into the investment strategies that stand up under long-term scrutiny and is refreshing research for every investor.”
―Stocks and Commodities
“A bible for investment strategies. . .”
―Seeking Alpha
About the Book:
Recent history has witnessed one of the worst stock market beatings ever. As a result, abysmal returns are being called “the new normal,” financial “experts” are ringing the death knell of buy-and-hold, and investors’ faith in equities has hit an all-time low. You have two choices. You can abandon the stock market based on what is happening today. Or you can invest today based on what will happen in the future.
Containing all new data, What Works on Wall Street, Fourth Edition, is the only investing guide that lets you see today’s market in its proper context― as part of the historical ebb and flow of the stock market. And when you see the data, you’ll see there is no argument: Stocks work.
Now in its second decade of helping investors succeed with stocks, What Works on Wall Streetcontinues to provide the most effective investing strategies, presenting incontrovertible data on what works and what doesn’t. Updated with current statistics and brand-new features, What Works on Wall Street offers data on almost 90 years of market performance, including:

Stocks ranked by market capitalization
Price-to-earnings ratios
EBITDA to enterprise value
Price-to-cash flow, -sales, and -book ratios
Dividend, buyback, and shareholder yields
One-year earnings-per-share percentage changes

Providing you with unparalleled insights into stock performance going back to 1926, What Works on Wall Street is a refreshingly calming, objective view of a subject that is usually wrapped in drama, hyperbole, and opinions that are plain wrong.
This comprehensive guide provides the objective facts and winning strategies you need; all you have to do is make the decision to ignore the so-called market experts and rely on the long-proven approach that has made What Works on Wall Street an investing classic.

Detailed Analysis







Guru Score:
                            50%




MARKET CAP:  [PASS] The first requirement of the Cornerstone Growth Strategy is that the company has a market capitalization of at least $150 million. This will screen out the companies that are too illiquid for most investors, but still include a small growth company.  LAWS, with a market cap of $180 million, passes this criterion.EARNINGS PER SHARE PERSISTENCE:  [FAIL] The Cornerstone Growth methodology looks for companies that show persistent earnings growth without regard to magnitude. To fulfill this requirement, a company's earnings must increase each year for a five year period. LAWS, whose annual EPS before extraordinary items for the last 5 years (from earliest to the most recent fiscal year) were -$7.46, -$0.81, -$0.70, $0.03 and -$0.19, fails this test. PRICE/SALES RATIO:  [PASS] The Price/Sales ratio should be below 1.5. This value criterion, coupled with the growth criterion, identify growth stocks that are still cheap to buy. LAWS's Price/Sales ratio of 0.64, based on trailing 12 month sales, passes this criterion.RELATIVE STRENGTH:  [FAIL] The final criterion for the Cornerstone Growth Strategy requires that the Relative Strength of the company be among the top 50 of the stocks screened using the previous criterion. This gives you the opportunity to buy the growth stocks you are searching for just as the market is embracing them. LAWS has a relative strength of 38. Therefore, it would fail not only the three previous required criterion but also the overall methodology.

Biography[edit]
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.[4]
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the Board of Directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting to large pension funds and foundations.[5]
In 1991, O'Shaughnessy moved his family to Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to the New York area, where most of his business was located.
O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market and, in 1994, his first book Invest Like the Best was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.[6]
In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O’Shaughnessy funds family.[7]
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet.[8] The company was closed in 2001.[9] As part of Netfolio’s concentration on “personal funds” O’Shaughnessy Capital Management sold their mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.[10]
In 2001, O’Shaughnessy and his team from O’Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O’Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity. In 2007, O’Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.[11][12]
O'Shaughnessy currently serves as Chairman of the Board for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center[13] and also serves on the Board of Directors for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts[14] and the Board of Trustees for Common Good.[15]

Biography[edit]
James P. O'Shaughnessy was born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he attended Saint Thomas Academy as a youth. His fascination with the stock market began at an early age when he started to manually track characteristics common to the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stock index. After studying international economics and business diplomacy at the School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University, O'Shaughnessy graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Minnesota in 1986.[4]
After graduating, O'Shaughnessy worked for a family-owned venture capital firm. During this time, his interest in quantitative research was recognized by a colleague who was on the Board of Directors with O'Shaughnessy at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. The colleague suggested that O'Shaughnessy's research might be well suited for pension plan management. In 1988, O'Shaughnessy started O'Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc. and began consulting to large pension funds and foundations.[5]
In 1991, O'Shaughnessy moved his family to Greenwich, Connecticut to be closer to the New York area, where most of his business was located.
O'Shaughnessy continued to apply his research of the stock market and, in 1994, his first book Invest Like the Best was published, followed by the first edition of What Works on Wall Street in 1997, How to Retire Rich in 1998, and Predicting the Markets of Tomorrow in 2006.
O'Shaughnessy started his own mutual funds under the names Cornerstone Growth and Cornerstone Value in 1996.[6]
In 1997, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) launched the RBC O'Shaughnessy mutual funds for Canadian investors. Currently, there are seven mutual funds in the RBC O’Shaughnessy funds family.[7]
In 1999, O'Shaughnessy started Netfolio, The Personal Fund Company, to offer individual investors the ability to build their own diversified portfolio over the internet.[8] The company was closed in 2001.[9] As part of Netfolio’s concentration on “personal funds” O’Shaughnessy Capital Management sold their mutual fund family to Hennessy Advisors in June 2000.[10]
In 2001, O’Shaughnessy and his team from O’Shaughnessy Capital Management moved to Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), where O’Shaughnessy served as a Senior Managing Director and the executive director of Systematic Equity. In 2007, O’Shaughnessy reached an agreement with Bear Stearns to spin his Systematic team out of BSAM to form O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, LLC.[11][12]
O'Shaughnessy currently serves as Chairman of the Board for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center[13] and also serves on the Board of Directors for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts[14] and the Board of Trustees for Common Good.[15]

Detailed Analysis







Guru Score:
                            25%




MARKET CAP:  [PASS] The first requirement of the Cornerstone Growth Strategy is that the company has a market capitalization of at least $150 million. This will screen out the companies that are too illiquid for most investors, but still include a small growth company.  CPLP, with a market cap of $521 million, passes this criterion.EARNINGS PER SHARE PERSISTENCE:  [FAIL] The Cornerstone Growth methodology looks for companies that show persistent earnings growth without regard to magnitude. To fulfill this requirement, a company's earnings must increase each year for a five year period. CPLP, whose annual EPS before extraordinary items for the last 5 years (from earliest to the most recent fiscal year) were -$0.46, $0.81, $0.32, $0.38 and $0.34, fails this test. PRICE/SALES RATIO:  [FAIL] The Price/Sales ratio should be below 1.5. This value criterion, coupled with the growth criterion, identify growth stocks that are still cheap to buy. Unfortunately, CPLP's Price/Sales ratio of 2.14, based on trailing 12 month sales, fails this criterion.RELATIVE STRENGTH:  [FAIL] The final criterion for the Cornerstone Growth Strategy requires that the Relative Strength of the company be among the top 50 of the stocks screened using the previous criterion. This gives you the opportunity to buy the growth stocks you are searching for just as the market is embracing them. CPLP has a relative strength of 38. Therefore, it would fail not only the three previous required criterion but also the overall methodology.
