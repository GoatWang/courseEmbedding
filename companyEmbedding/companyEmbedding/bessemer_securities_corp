BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Bessemer Securities Acts to Get Aggressive


By DANIEL F. CUFF


Published: January 19, 1989









                    The Bessemer Securities Corporation, a staid Wall Street investment firm owned by the Phipps family, said yesterday that it planned to get more aggressive and hired a new president and chief executive, Ward W. Woods Jr., as a first step.        

                    Mr. Woods, 46 years old, a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Company, fills a position last held by Jack Cardwell, who left in July.        

                    Ogden M. Phipps, the chairman of Bessemer, said Mr. Woods would provide fresh perspective and leadership.        

                    ''In fact,'' he said in a statement, ''under his leadership we plan to adopt a more aggressive investment posture, using our financial resources for restructurings, leveraged buyouts, corporate acquisitions and supportive investments in public companies.''        

                    Mr. Phipps said Bessemer was prepared to devote a significant portion of its resources to the new investment areas.        

                    Bessemer, named after the steel-making process, is a private holding company with its money currently invested in real estate, venture capital, private companies and securities.        

                    It is owned by the descendants of Henry C. Phipps, the son of a shoemaker who became a partner of Andrew Carnegie in his steel mills. When J. P. Morgan bought Carnegie's company to put together United States Steel, Henry Phipps received $43 million for his share - something like $500 million in today's money -which was the basis of a long-surviving family fortune.        

                    Mr. Woods said that the new post represented a ''great opportunity'' and that he looked forward to working at Bessemer ''with its great tradition and financial strengths.''        

                    He joined Lazard Freres as a general partner 10 years ago, after spending 10 years at Lehman Brothers as a managing director and partner. Mr. Woods grew up in La Jolla, Calif., went to Stanford University and worked in San Francisco in real estate and the construction business before coming to New York. He and his wife, Priscilla, have two teen-age daughters.

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.
