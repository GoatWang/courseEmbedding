  James Hope Promoted to Lead Chery Design to 'Next Level' in Europe                  CarsDesignPeopleTechnologyResourcesGalleriesVideosContactSubscribeMembersSearch      Trending Ford Design Organization Changes Emphasize Future StrategyArtCenter Institute of Design Hosts Design Forum in BeijingJaguar XE SV Project 8 Brings Exclusivity to the Common CarBMW X3 Aims To Rekindle The Flame, But Does It?Design Icons: Revisiting the Trend-Setting Mercedes-Benz CLS (2004)   AdvertiseContactAbout  HomePeopleDesigner MovesJames Hope Promoted to Lead Chery Design to ‘Next Level’ in Europe Eric Gallina June 23, 2017 Designer Moves, Designer Profiles      Last week,  Reuters published an article announcing former General Motors designer Steve Eum’s appointment to the role of ‘design chief’ at Chery, China’s leading vehicle exporter. This led me to the inevitable question: What happened to current executive design director James Hope?I contacted James Hope and found that he’s been promoted to lead Chery’s objectives from a newly created post in Germany. While Steve Eum will be assuming Hope’s current Executive Director role, taking over for the American designer in China, Hope is now being tasked with setting up Chery’s European satellite design studio.His new remit will see him move laterally to a newly created position as Executive Director of the new design center effective August 1, where he will build up the team and a establish new studio in Germany.“I’m very excited to be tasked with setting up Chery design center in Europe as Executive Director,” Hope told Form Trends in an exclusive interview. “After setting up Shanghai it’s a new challenge.”Hope, who will begin scouting locations for Chery’s new European design arm when he officially starts his new role in August, said that the location of the new studio had not yet been determined, but added that Berlin was on the shortlist. “We are number one international Chinese OEM exporter, and part of the strategic business plan to establish an international level studio to bring Chery design to the next level,” he added.Hope and Steve Eum will report to Chery’s head of product development, Raymond Bierzinski.Hope initially joined Chery as Corporate Director of Design in January 2012, when he moved to China from his previous role at (then) GM’s European arm in Rüsselsheim to set up Chery’s design center in Shanghai. He was promoted to the role of Executive Director of the design center in 2015, covering all design functions and overseeing the 90-strong design team.Over the course of his short tenure, Hope led Chery’s design objectives from the company’s design centers in Wuhu and Shanghai, implementing cohesive communication within the main design center and collaborating closely with Chery’s engineering operations to develop a number of successful concept and production vehicles.Since 2012, Chery’s design facility has grown considerably and added a number of experienced designers to the fold, including former GM Europe and Mercedes-Benz designer Sergio Loureiro da Silva — who joined from Opel in 2012 and has been Chery’s head of interior design since 2014 — and former Porsche and Ford designer Hakan Saracoglu, who is charged with advanced design.James Hope has been honored by the Chinese government on multiple occasions: in 2012 he obtained the Provincial 100-talent Foreign Experts Award; the next year he was recognized in the National 1000-talent Foreign Experts Award, and in 2014 he received the government’s National Friendship Award.Prior to joining Chery, Hope worked for General Motors in the US and Europe as well as for Tier 1 supplier Johnson Controls. A College for Creative Studies graduate, Hope started his career with Ford in Detroit. Ariana Glori..

Publisher's Description▼▲
Popular author James W. Moore draws on an old football term to explore the ways people let their fear stand in the way of living life and loving God to the fullest. The term "alligator arms refers to a would-be pass receiver who fails to stretch out full length to catch the ball, because he fears an impending tackle; he's more interested in protecting himself from the hard hit than catching the ball. This fearful attitude results in fumbled passes, in other words, lots of failure and frustration. "Having alligator arms is an ideal analogy for fearfully holding back rather than living life fully. In Do You Have Alligator Arms?, Moore explores what it means to let go of fear and purposefully embrace life, commitment, faith, hope, love, God, and others.


Author Bio▼▲

Description


Additional information



Description
Born in Drygrange, Roxburghshire, Scotland, James Hope moved to Canada after his mother died, and to Vermont after his father passed away.  While apprenticing to a wheelwright he took art classes.  Recovering from an injury in the 1840s gave him time to focus on drawing and painting, paving his path to become a full-time artist and teacher.  He started as a portrait artist, but influenced by artist Asher Durand, he later focused on landscapes.  In 1861 he organized 60 volunteers for the Company B 2nd Vermont Regiment to fight in the Civil War.  While serving as captain, he made drawings, recording major battles and military life that were later used in his large murals of the Antietam Battlefield.
Hope Paintings
In 1888 and 1889, after attending two reunions of veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic, Hope returned to the Antietam Battlefield. Making new sketches and using the ones he finished during the war, he began to work on a series of five paintings.  Completed in time for the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam held in Washington, DC, in September 1892, these murals were put on display and viewed by fellow veterans.  The five painting suffered a great deal of damage over the years, were purchased in 1979 by the National Park Service and meticulously restored.
This James Hope mug is part of our Civil War Series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed HistoryMugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

Description


Additional information



Description
Born in Drygrange, Roxburghshire, Scotland, James Hope moved to Canada after his mother died, and to Vermont after his father passed away.  While apprenticing to a wheelwright he took art classes.  Recovering from an injury in the 1840s gave him time to focus on drawing and painting, paving his path to become a full-time artist and teacher.  He started as a portrait artist, but influenced by artist Asher Durand, he later focused on landscapes.  In 1861 he organized 60 volunteers for the Company B 2nd Vermont Regiment to fight in the Civil War.  While serving as captain, he made drawings, recording major battles and military life that were later used in his large murals of the Antietam Battlefield.
Hope Paintings
In 1888 and 1889, after attending two reunions of veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic, Hope returned to the Antietam Battlefield. Making new sketches and using the ones he finished during the war, he began to work on a series of five paintings.  Completed in time for the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam held in Washington, DC, in September 1892, these murals were put on display and viewed by fellow veterans.  The five painting suffered a great deal of damage over the years, were purchased in 1979 by the National Park Service and meticulously restored.
This James Hope mug is part of our Civil War Series profiling participants in the War Between the States.  Thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers fought in battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.  We honor their sacrifices by telling their stories.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed HistoryMugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.
