The Surge of “TCCWNA” Class Actions in New Jersey

September 9, 2016

Daniel Mee, David S. Osterman and Leah A. Brndjar 
Consumer Protection

Until recently, the New Jersey Truth-In-Consumer Contract Warranty and Notice Act (TCCWNA or the Act) was a relatively obscure consumer protection statute that sat dormant on New Jersey’s books for almost three decades. That all changed when a series of cases opened the floodgates to consumer class action litigation. In April, the New Jersey Civil Justice Institute issued a staggering prediction that the wave of TCCWNA lawsuits against retailers and other defendants could double in size over the next two years.

Supreme Court Set to Hear Cases on “No-Injury” Class Actions

David S. Osterman and Daniel Mee

Defeating “Unnatural” Class Actions

June 30, 2015

Daniel Mee 
Class Action,Class Action Lawsuits,Labeling,Litigation

On June 12, 2015 a plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit against Kraft Foods claiming that its Capri Sun beverages are not “all natural” because they contain citric acid and flavorings. “Simply put,” the plaintiff alleges in Osborne v. Kraft Foods Group, Inc., “they contain unnatural ingredients.” These allegations have become commonplace in beverage labeling class actions. Snapple, AriZona, Skinnygirl Margarita mix, and Pure Leaf Iced Tea have all faced similar accusations. The Pure Leaf class action complaint, Laboon v. Unilever U.S., Inc. filed…
