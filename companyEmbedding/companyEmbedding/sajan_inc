Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

On April 12, 2017, Sajan, Inc. entered into an amendment to its revolving line of credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. The Amendment extends the maturity date of the Credit Facility to March 27, 2018. Additionally, the Amendment adjusted the interest rate provisions to provide that the unpaid principal amount borrowed under the Credit Facility accrues interest at a floating rate per annum equal to 0.5% above the “prime rate” published from time to time in the money rates section of the Wall Street Journal (the “Prime Rate”) when the liquidity ratio is greater than or equal to 1.75 to 1.0 and 1.75% above the Prime Rate when the liquidity ratio is less than 1.75 to 1.0. The interest rate floor remains set at 4.0% per annum. Additionally, the Amendment deletes the fee previously required to be paid based on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement between the Company and Silicon Valley Bank, entered into as of April 12, 2017 and effective as of March 27, 2017. The Amendment now requires the Company to maintain a consolidated minimum tangible net worth of at least $4,000,000 increasing as of the last day of each fiscal quarter by an amount equal to 25% of the sum of (i) the Company’s net income for such quarter, (ii) any increase in the principal amount of the Company’s outstanding subordinated debt during such quarter, and (iii) the net amount of proceeds received by the Company in such quarter from the sale or issuance of equity securities. Losses in any quarter do not reduce the required tangible net worth. The Amendment also provides that following a permitted acquisition by the Company, the Company will no longer have to comply with the tangible net worth covenant; rather, the Company will be required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, EBITDA of at least $250,000 for the trailing six (6) month period ending on the last day of each month.
