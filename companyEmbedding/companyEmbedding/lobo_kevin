Personal information[edit]
Lobo was born in Mumbai, India and lived in Montreal, Canada. He met his wife Shazie Zaman in college and they have two children. Lobo has lived in Europe and speaks French and English.
Lobo played on his high school basketball, football, and soccer teams and he played squash in junior college. He now enjoys golf.[1]
Current executive roles[edit]
Lobo was appointed to the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Group President of Stryker Corporation in 2012. He became a Director of the Parker-Hannifin Corporation in 2013 and Chairman of Stryker in 2014. He sits on the boards of: the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), the Business Leaders for Michigan and United Way for Kalamazoo/Battle Creek regions. He is also a member of the Business Roundtable.
Vis-à-vis Stryker, Lobo spends his time in their Kalamazoo corporate office and traveling to regional offices to meet with employees and customers. Soon after he became CEO, he led the firm in its first acquisition in China – Trauson Holdings Co., costing $764 million. This also helped the firm expand into the trauma surgery industry, a fast emerging market in the orthopedics field. Of the acquisition Lobo said: “That was a heavy decision and I feel very good about it. There are a lot of learnings. These are all firsts for me – my first time meeting with investors and analysts, managing and working with a board of directors, but with any new job you learn to make decisions. I'm pleased I have had the chance to speak to more than half of our employees this year around the world.”
Lobo explains his philosophy behind his job at leading the firm, like this: the first step is always to listen.[2]
His total compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was: $9,120,147.[3]
Employment history[edit]
Before taking on the lead role at the firm, Lobo was Group President of New Jersey-based Stryker Orthopedics. Prior to joining Stryker, he held various positions at Johnson & Johnson, including President of Ethicon Endo Surgery, President of Johnson & Johnson Medical Products Canada, and CFO of McNeil Consumer Healthcare and Ortho Women’s Health & Urology.[4] Lobo also spent eight years with Rhone-Poulenc, including roles based in Europe as Worldwide Corporate Controller of the chemical spin-out, Rhodia, and General Manager of Specialty Phosphates EMEA, supervising six manufacturing plants in an industry and country in which he had very minimal knowledge. Describing it as a “stretch assignment,” he explained that he learned to realize that “success hinges entirely on making sure you have the right people that are engaged and focused on performance. If you do that, it doesn’t matter what industry or country you’re in, you can have success.” Lobo started his career in a number of finance positions with Kraft Canada, Unilever and KPMG.
Education[edit]
Lobo received his Bachelor's degree in Commerce from McGill University and his MBA from the University of Toronto.[4]

Personal information[edit]
Lobo was born in Mumbai, India and lived in Montreal, Canada. He met his wife Shazie Zaman in college and they have two children. Lobo has lived in Europe and speaks French and English.
Lobo played on his high school basketball, football, and soccer teams and he played squash in junior college. He now enjoys golf.[1]
Current executive roles[edit]
Lobo was appointed to the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Group President of Stryker Corporation in 2012. He became a Director of the Parker-Hannifin Corporation in 2013 and Chairman of Stryker in 2014. He sits on the boards of: the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), the Business Leaders for Michigan and United Way for Kalamazoo/Battle Creek regions. He is also a member of the Business Roundtable.
Vis-à-vis Stryker, Lobo spends his time in their Kalamazoo corporate office and traveling to regional offices to meet with employees and customers. Soon after he became CEO, he led the firm in its first acquisition in China – Trauson Holdings Co., costing $764 million. This also helped the firm expand into the trauma surgery industry, a fast emerging market in the orthopedics field. Of the acquisition Lobo said: “That was a heavy decision and I feel very good about it. There are a lot of learnings. These are all firsts for me – my first time meeting with investors and analysts, managing and working with a board of directors, but with any new job you learn to make decisions. I'm pleased I have had the chance to speak to more than half of our employees this year around the world.”
Lobo explains his philosophy behind his job at leading the firm, like this: the first step is always to listen.[2]
His total compensation for the 2014 fiscal year was: $9,120,147.[3]
Employment history[edit]
Before taking on the lead role at the firm, Lobo was Group President of New Jersey-based Stryker Orthopedics. Prior to joining Stryker, he held various positions at Johnson & Johnson, including President of Ethicon Endo Surgery, President of Johnson & Johnson Medical Products Canada, and CFO of McNeil Consumer Healthcare and Ortho Women’s Health & Urology.[4] Lobo also spent eight years with Rhone-Poulenc, including roles based in Europe as Worldwide Corporate Controller of the chemical spin-out, Rhodia, and General Manager of Specialty Phosphates EMEA, supervising six manufacturing plants in an industry and country in which he had very minimal knowledge. Describing it as a “stretch assignment,” he explained that he learned to realize that “success hinges entirely on making sure you have the right people that are engaged and focused on performance. If you do that, it doesn’t matter what industry or country you’re in, you can have success.” Lobo started his career in a number of finance positions with Kraft Canada, Unilever and KPMG.
Education[edit]
Lobo received his Bachelor's degree in Commerce from McGill University and his MBA from the University of Toronto.[4]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time.

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Stryker CEO: How We Are Innovating Now

Kevin Lobo addresses how the concept of innovation has changed in medtech and the bets that Stryker has taken along the way. 
Arundhati Parmar

 
Kevin Lobo is a passionate man.
He speaks quickly and with determination, his fingers drumming upon the desk in front of him to stress the salient points he is making. When you try to convince him to see your perspective, he takes your point, explains why he thinks it makes little sense, and leaves you feeling surprisingly unrejected.
In a wide-ranging interview at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in Orlando in March, Lobo addressed innovation—a subject that is of paramount importance in medtech at a time when the ground beneath is shifting rapidly.
“In the old days we were a feature benefit company just like everyone else—make me a better one of these and charge a premium price,” he said of what innovation meant in the recent past. “Those days are over.”
That realization made Stryker take a radical decision about its Triathlon total knee replacement implant a few years ago. Here’s how Lobo recalled it, in a slightly edited version:
At the time, we made a gutsy decision. I was interviewed on October 31, 2012,  at the Cleveland Clinic and there was an aggressive interviewer.
He asked, “When’s your new knee going to come out?”
I said, ‘I don't even have one in development.’
There were 600 people in the audience that gasped—literally gasped—when I said that.
He said,  “You’re going to lose,” and I said, “No we’re not." 

When critics pointed out that Stryker's two biggest competitors were launching new knees, Lobo countered with, "Ours is the most proven on the market.”
So Stryker stuck to its guns, deciding to innovate somewhere else, albeit with an innovation driven by an acquisition.
“What have we done instead is we acquired Mako to innovate on the procedure, which is now a robotic instrument,” Lobo said.
Stryker bought Mako Surgical in 2013 for about $1.65 billion. Lobo firmly believes that this surgical robotic platform will improve joint replacement procedures for both surgeons and patients. Following the acquisition Stryker’s joint replacement products are being moved to the robotic system. A total hip and partial knee is already available and Lobo expects to launch the Triathlon knee on Mako next year, even though FDA has already blessed this integration.
While acquiring Mako was a process innovation, Stryker has been doing product innovations too. The Kalamazoo, MI, company has leveraged 3-D printing to make components for the Triathlon knee.
“We have launched a brand new 3-D printed tibial base plate which enables cementless knee [procedures],” Lobo said, adding that the device is made of porous titanium and enables bone fixation. In fact, Stryker is so sold on the promise of 3-D printing that the company is building a 3-D manufacturing plant in Ireland.
Aside from aiming to innovate on how joint replacements are done, Stryker is also engaging in business model innovation. This is a move that slowly larger medtech are getting on board with.
In late March, Stryker announced that it is offering a money-back guarantee for its patient safety technology, which prevents the error of retained surgical instruments in patients undergoing surgery. Stryker is giving hospitals up to $5 million and additional refunds if its SurgiCount  system fails to account for every surgical sponge used during surgery. 
“That’s something we have never done before,” Lobo said of the money-back guarantee. “I am wide open to risk-based contracting. I think the future is going to have lots of it.”
