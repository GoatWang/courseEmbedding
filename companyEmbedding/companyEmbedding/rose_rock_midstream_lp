Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. Revenue and Financial Data

   A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, or so says Rose Rock Midstream, (formerly for SemCrude L.P.). Rose Rock Midstream was established in 2011 to take over the assets of SemCrude, the storage and pipeline division of SemGroup. Rose Rock Midstream's new assets include SemCrude's crude oil storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma; its gathering and transportation system in Kansas and Oklahoma; its Bakken Shale operations, and its Platteville, Colorado crude oil unloading facility. The only midstream operation Rose Rock won't handle is the White Cliffs Pipeline, which will continue to be 51%-owned by SemCrude Pipeline, L.L.C. In 2014 Rose Rock Midstream acquired trucking assets from a unit of Chesapeake Energy.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
