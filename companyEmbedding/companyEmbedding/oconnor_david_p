David Procter
As you began your career, what films/cinematographers did you study and why? To be honest I studied the work of a huge range – from American greats like Conrad Hall ASC to modern British cinematographers like Roger Deakins BSC. I was always inspired heavily by foreign cinematographers, most notably Russian Mikhail Krickman’s collaborations with Andrey Zvyagintsev. I am mostly influenced by independent and art-house cinema, stylistically speaking. But I’ve always tried to draw influence from a wide range, which is one of the most exciting aspects of cinema – the diversity within it.
What other artistic fields influence your work? I’m very inspired by music, ranging from classical to electronic and everything in between. I also look at photographers – I think that’s a fairly common trait of cinematographers. And over the years I’ve often looked at the work of painters from past centuries because they really provide an amazing inspiration. They were the first artists to explore the concept of controlling light. It’s truly fascinating
Give us an example of a movie, a sequence that says “this is what making movies is all about”. One film really stands out for me – a French movie called The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. It’s a true story about a man suffering from locked in syndrome where his body is paralysed but his mind is still sharp. It’s a powerfully executed piece of cinema that is beautifully crafted. The cinematography is outstanding, the performances exceptional. Everything about it is powerful, and I remember seeing it for the first time and being blown away.
The use of the protagonist’s POV throughout the story is key, such an unusual technique but so compelling. When everything comes together, the emotion, performance, picture, music and sound, in such a way that it is far beyond the sum of its parts – that’s something special.
What is one of your favourite locations that you’ve shot and why? I’ve been fortunate to shoot in so many special places, but India is one of my favourite locations. I’ve done both commercial and documentary work there, and been there several times. I love working there. There’s something unique about the light, the kind of polluted haze that is absolutely unique and incredible to capture on camera. There is an energy in the air that I enjoy, the colours, the smells. The people are really friendly and it’s a very lively and exciting place to shoot.
If you hadn’t become a cinematographer, what would you have done? I think I would have been a chef. I feel there are many parallels between cooking and cinematography. There are a few jobs that have this balance between art and science, artistry and craft. Cooking is about getting the right ingredients together and this is particularly relevant to lighting. The right balance of where you light or where you don’t, soft light, hard light, colour, it’s the same with flavours of a dish. Shooting a scene perfectly is also about using the right combination of ingredients in the same way as preparing a meal.
As you speak to others who have the passion for the industry you do, what kind of advice do you pass on? Keep going. Never give up. And never stop learning. It can be a very slow moving industry, and on the flip side things can also happen really quickly, so it’s important to persevere and be patient.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

David L. O'Connor
Senior Vice President for Energy & Clean Technology
David helps energy and technology companies expand their markets and accelerate their growth. With deep knowledge of the energy industry and environmental issues, David helps these companies shape emerging public policies to their advantage. His clients include companies that deliver energy efficiency services, develop wind, biomass and other renewable power plants, install transmission and smart grid technologies, and bring new low-carbon fuels and offsets to the marketplace.
Experience
David has been a leader and problem-solver in the public and private sectors for more than 30 years. Most recently, he served as the Massachusetts Commissioner of Energy Resources during the tenures of five Governors, from 1995 through 2007. During this time, he developed and managed many of the state's energy policies and programs. 

                Under his leadership, Massachusetts began a historic movement to expand the use of clean energy. For example, he implemented the first-ever standards for renewable energy use and renewable certificate trading in New England. David oversaw the operation by electric and gas utilities of $150 million annually in energy efficiency programs. He was a member of the Massachusetts team that negotiated the first-ever multi-state agreement known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to limit emissions of climate-changing carbon from power plants. 
As a member of the state Energy Facilities Siting Board from 1995 to 2007, he voted to approve the siting of several billion dollars in new power plants across the state, including the Cape Wind power plant. For more than ten years, he led Massachusetts' participation in the deregulation of the region's $15 billion electricity market. He testified regularly before legislative committees, gave hundreds of media interviews, and often represented the Governor of Massachusetts before state and federal regulatory agencies.
Prior to his appointment as Energy Commissioner, David held a number of positions in the dispute resolution field. He founded and directed the Massachusetts Office of Dispute Resolution, the first state agency in the U.S. created to resolve non-labor, public disputes. Before that, he was the chief mediator of the first regional environmental mediation service in the United States. From 1987 to 1993, David served as an Adjunct Lecturer at Tufts University in the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy, where he taught graduate courses on negotiation and conflict resolution in public-sector, multi-party disputes.
David currently serves on several professional and philanthropic boards, including the Board of Directors of the Environmental Business Council of New England, the Policy Committee of the New England Clean Energy Council and the Governing Board of the Massachusetts Ocean Partnership.
