Dividend Growth Portfolio



 
We created our dividend growth portfolio, DGP, in 2005 in response to client needs.  It is a separately managed stock portfolio of companies which pay dividends, supported by earnings, where both are expected to grow in the future.  It provides an ideal way of getting a growing stream of income from investments which, unlike bonds, is not dependent on where interest rates are.  In addition to providing a stream of income which is expected to grow over time, the underlying assets also, unlike bonds, have the opportunity to appreciate.  Particularly in this very low interest rate environment, DGP investments can be an attractive part of many portfolios.

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                    What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
                                     


How Do Banks Work?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													The manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic, but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years, it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry.

Having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself. Banks exist to solve that problem, and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the Italian Renaissance, the Crusades, or even earlier, depending on which historians you consult.

More specifically, banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) to other customers, who repay the money with interest over time. Depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons: 1) banks offer safe-keeping, borne from FDIC insurance; and 2) banks pay interest on deposits, allowing funds to grow over time. Banks, in turn, make money, by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits. Banks can have other sources of revenue as well, including investments, fees on various services, and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance.

In addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending, banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms. For example, banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies. Banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve.
											

How Do I Choose a Bank?
By: Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO
													When it comes to selecting a bank, the options can be overwhelming. In past generations, it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office, or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster. These days, you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an online-only bank that has no branch offices at all. Special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking, introductory interest rates, or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account.

But before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers, take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you.

Do you need a brick-and-mortar location? You may find yourself in need of a safe-deposit box. Or if questions arise, you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with face-to-face communication. If you need access to a real building staffed by live people, prioritize your bank’s location and hours.

Bankers’ hours are notoriously short, and if your workday overlaps them completely, you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home, so that you can slip in at lunchtime. Or you might want to look for a bank with better hours.

Are you a technophile? You may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an online-only bank or bank account. By the same token, you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements, keeping tabs on your account balance electronically, and using mobile apps to locate ATMs that are within your network.

These are great opportunities, and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them. If your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps, it helps to be realistic. Read through the fine print, understand the fees and penalties, and decide whether they work for your lifestyle.

Do you travel abroad extensively? International financial transactions have never been easier or less labor-intensive. And while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers.

If you’re a frequent international traveler, it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market.  Not only will this enable you to avoid the industry-standard 3% international surcharge, but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since Visa and Mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks.  You should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use, nor foreign ATM withdrawals.

Is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking? Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye. But the banking industry is not a monolithic entity. Many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development, fair lending, and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs.

These institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins, but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible.  They’re worth a look at the very least.
											

What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													If your bank is FDIC insured, any money you put into a deposit account, along with any earned interest, will be returned to you, even if your bank fails. There are limits, of course. Insurance coverage tops out at $250,000 per depositor, per institution—not per account, as some people assume. That means if you have $125,000 in a money market account and another $125,000 in a CD at the same bank, you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured.

It’s important to note that FDIC insurance covers deposit accounts only, that is, checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide, such as annuities, life insurance, and mutual funds (including money market funds), are not insured.

Most banks and thrifts (also known as savings and loan institutions), are FDIC insured, but a few are not. By law, those that are must display the FDIC logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials. If you don’t see the logo, or if you have any doubts, ask about coverage. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but they do have an insurance program of their own, sponsored by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  As is the case with banks, this provides coverage for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

The FDIC, which stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was founded by the U.S. government in 1933 in response to the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression. FDIC insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers, commerce, other banks, and the overall economy. And one of the hard lessons of the 1920s and 1930s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse. Deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank, even in the face of frightening economic and financial news. In that way, it protects not only the consumer, but also the banks and the economy.

Depending on your needs for a checking account, like direct deposit or checks, I suggest letting your credit cool off and open what's called a simple card account. It does require proof of identity, no fees, allows direct deposit, and is a Visa cash, not credit card.Also, I'd suggest talking to a credit union about an account, because their systems run checks - it is not the same as a traditional bank check system.

I've been in same position and resorted to doing a title loan, but not your usual one. Look into a company called New Deal. They provide title loans assistance but, the % is wal less and since collateral is involved, they'll be more willing. It goes on credit as a loan, and also helps improve your credit score with each on time payment

Walmart had something called bluebird checking and you get a debit card also. There are NO Fees. You cannot get overdrafts like I have at Wells Fargo and Chase when I specifically wrote and told them no on overdrafting. I would deposit the money before opening the next business day but those monster banks were so greedy making it like they did me a favor charging me 34.00 and usually for less than 34.00 over and I had the money in by the next business day. Also Amex Serve charges very little depending on your habits and which plan you select. As another mentioned, credit unions are another good place to call and nowadays are more lax on who can open accounts. Go to the social worker at the hospital and see if he/she can help. They sometimes have extended payment plans, partial forgiveness, low interest, etc. for such things. The billing office probably won't help you so if the are bothering you tell them you are working with the social worker to get it paid. I don't know if you qualify for Medicaid within 3 mo of the illness but health and human resources in your state would be able to help you then. But you would have to have very low income and less than 2,000 in resources not counting your house or car. There are other agencies in your city/county that may also help. One place to call is 211.… read more

...and so there is this checking acc. from Wells Fargo called "Everyday Checking".Here is how it works: You open an account that consists of a Savings Acc. with some minimal starting amount (in my case opening was $100) and a checking acc.with lets say $4600 for total of $4700.This type of Acc. "Everyday Checking", comes with a $10 Monthly Service Fee, which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of $1500.Now as part of this checking/savings acc. is a scam called "Save As You Go". That means that every time you make some electronic transaction (like paying a bill), usually $1, $2, $3 or more dollars, (depending on the amount of the transaction), will be transferred from your checking part of the acc. to the Saving acc.The idea is that YOU are to stupid to manage and save your own money, so Wells Fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savings.As a result of this scam, you can find yourself in a position where you have, lets say, $400 in your Savings acc., and $1600 in your checking, for a total of $2000.So, lets assume You make a "bill pay" to your Cable Co. of $100, that leaves a balance in your checking acc. of $1500, and your So called "Save As You Go"savings acc., still has the $400 for a total of $1900.Here is the kicker, remember, You checking had $1600, you paid the cable co. $100, you have left $1500, but because Well Fargo moved $1 dollar to your savings, your Savings amount became $401, and your checking $1499.At $1499 in your checking, you are below the $1500 and therefore you are subject to a $10 Monthly Service Fee, even though you still have $401 in your savings.now, I am sure that those very young, smart, highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom, get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the Bank's profits, but ultimately, a "Pig with a Lipstick, is still a pig".It should be obvious by now that my issue is not the $10.I could close my acc. and make sure that these will be the first, the last and the only $10 wells Fargo will ever take from me (very inexpensive insurance policy against wells Fargo ever taking another penny out of me). I still think is a scam, is designed to exploit the poor and I will forward my thoughts and your response to the local news (starting with Michael Turko of the Turko Files Ch. 9 - KUSI News - San Diego, CA), and follow with Huffington Post and let the public decide with their comments whether my point is valid or not.… read more

You've totaly misread the 3 ways to avoid the $10.00 fee. First off, if you DO the savings, that alone automatically waives the $10.00 checking fee. 2nd is if you use your debit card 10x, and Wells Fargo is very upfront, in fact, around 1pm, they post pending transactions that come in that night! So, at 2pm your balance could be -$90.00 and you can cover it before they post that night! NO other bank lets you know what's coming through, as that's money directly out of their pocket! 3rd is to simply have a measly $500.00 in direct deposits for the month, and this includes direct deposits from square and cash.me/scotttampa . Also, they are up front about these too! You have 24-7 access next to each option, it shows how many debit card purchases you have ( I just run 10 $1.00 charges through square) and also shows your total direct deposits, and one month I came up short and guess what! They didn't charge the $10.00... they said "as a valued customer we've noticed you came close this month so we'll waive the $10.00 but please keep an eye on your numbers and make sure one of the options is completed each month.So, You are WAY off base. Also, I created this account on their website in 5 minutes with only a $25.00 initial deposit! Received a debit card and signature card to sign and mail back within 4 days. BEST BANK I'VE EVER BANKED WITH, as they don't HIDE THINGS.Scott McClellanTampa, Florida… read more

Credit Union of the Rockies used to be a good institution, but it seems they have lost all customer service. I had been with them for 15+years. We had financed a car and our home and had a standing line of credit. We maintained a healthy balance in our accounts and were never late on a payment (actually we always paid our loans off early. Anyway, we were buying a condo as an investment and needed a mortgage for about 25% of the property (we were bringing a 75% down-payment to the table). Credit Unions of the Rockies uses a mortgage broker, we applied and the service we received was appalling: Keith Schnell, theLoan Officer with CU Members Mortgage was very slow to communicate and even though we applied 6 weeks prior to the closing, he was still messing around two days before closing. We ended up taking a short term loan from another source and closing without the loan from the Credit Union of the Rockies. The poor performance of Mr. Schnell and CUR costs us time, an $400 appraisal and put our $5,000 earnest money at risk. I have had almost no follow up from the CUR even though I left messages and send a letter when closing our accounts. I can not recommend Credit Union of the Rockies or Credit Union Members Mortgage.… read more

I recently discontinued my account with this bank for several reasons. I was with TD Bank since them being Commerce Bank. I truly enjoyed the fact that they were open 7 days a week and had longer working hours then other banks. The customer service was excellent and I had no issues with them. A bout 2 years after them becoming TD Bank I started to notice several fees being charged to my account. And even more overdraft fees when I specifically called them and took that option off of my account so that I would never overdraft it. The customer service was horrible. This became such a problem that I ended up having hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. I am planing on taking this matter to court because of the fact that they are liars and I feel that they do that just to take money from you.… read more

Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone. Best to look else where for your online banking needs.… read more

I have been using the Washington Federal bank for maybe three years now,and it seems to me that they are one of those banks that wants to keep your money if you put it in their bank. There was an instance when I was trying to withdraw my money and got to the bank 10 minutes early before they would stop letting people withdraw their money or transfer it. Because of the long lines, I ended up having to wait 12 minutes, and so I was 2 minutes late. The women inside refused to give me money, and i did not have any money for the weekend. I called her supervisor and it was resolved, but it should not have happened in the first place. it was horrible ,and I am not too fond of them anymore. Watch out with this bank, they will try to keep YOUR money.… read more

I have a fixed mortgage of 5.5% with Weber state Credit Union. Back in June, I applied for re-financing with the same lender. I was approved for a rate of 3.25%. Closing was supposed to take place at end of August, but it did not because the bank made an error on some house paperwork that is invalid. They now have to go through the process of removing the error, but I have to continue to pay a higher interest on my mortgage - not to any fault of my own.

I have overall been happy with the services I have received and the 24/7 support I have gotten abroad and domestically. There have been several situations in which my bank account had been compromised and needed assistance with Bashas. Although they weren't as quick to respond as BofA would be, they still worked hard to send me new cards and secure my account without too much of a hassle.

They offer certain benefits to the checking account that I truly appreciate such as no International withdrawal fees. The customer service is excellent whenever I've had to call for various reasons.

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years. Whenever I call or visit Wells Fargo, the customer service is usually very good. The agent is very respectful and appreciative and handles queries as best as s/he can. Recently, I accidentally left my card in the ATM machine at my local branch. When I called the bank about it, they informed me that the ATM will automatically shred the card if I do not take it out of the machine. They went ahead and arranged for a new one to be sent to my address. In the meantime, they told me to visit a local branch, and an agent could issue me a temporary card connected to my account. I visited a branch later that day, and was issued a card within five minutes. I was quite impressed with the efficiency and speed. I had been so annoyed with myself, thinking about how inconvenient my "card-less" existence would be for the next week. In the end, Wells Fargo made this inconvenience as hassle-free as possible, which I did really appreciate.… read more

I have my main checking and savings account with them, as well as used them for two different car loans. The loan process was very new and overwhelming to me, but the associate at Cedar Point answered all questions, recommended the best type of loan for me, and set up the loan and payment plan with ease.The employees are very knowledgeable, eager to help, and make you feel welcomed at "at home." They remember names of their clients, and you are always welcomed (usually by name) as soon as you enter.

I have had no problems with TD bank at all so far. I have been using them for 4 years, since I was a freshman at my college. I chose them because they were close to my home and they had a student specialty program so I wouldn't need a specific amount of dollars in my bank account. A td bank atm was even in my college as well, providing extra convenience. I love that they allow you to take their pens. The feel and atmosphere of the bank was nice. They always allow you to get free items such as candy or hand sanitizers. Every experience with them has gone smoothly.

I have been a member of Patriot Federal Credit Union for 4years now, and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them. They offer all the convenience of the big banks but at a fraction of the cost. I initially started with them because of the favorable loan options a credit union can provide, and have never been let down. The interest I pay for loans is much lower then any traditional lending institution I've shopped with. If you live in an area that Patriot Federal Credit Union serves, I would highly recommend establishing a relationship with them.

I can’t say enough great things about having USAA as a bank. Their overall fees are very low, and they reimburse you for a certain amount of ATM withdrawl fees each month. Additionally, their online banking app is extremely easy to use, and you can easily deposit checks through your mobile phone. Customer service is stellar too.

I thought that I would have to co-sign for him,but that was not to be. I have 4 accounts with MFCU,a savings,a Christmas club account,and two checking accounts.

Bank of America has been my bank for many years. Once there was an incident where my account had been comprised ( by someone nameless ). I went into the bank to resolve it. Honestly I was surprised and relieved at how this was handled. One account had to be closed, a new one opened; easy and painless. So many pleasing attributes in my opinion, not to mention ease of use, banking online, bill pay, chat, and the list goes on. The thing I enjoy most about my bank is I'm able to transfer funds easily to family members and vise versa. Oh did I mention some overdraft fees have been refunded as a courtesy. I can go on and go. Just love my bank!… read more

Charles Schwab as by far the best customer service I have ever experienced from a banking institution. The reason I initially choose Schwab is because i could get a free brokerage account if I opened a checking. I am so glad I did. I will never go back to local banks. Schwab has mobile deposit, the rehiburse your atm fees and if you have issues they call you back the next day to ensure they have been resolved!… read more

America first credit union is the best bank. The teller know your names when you walk in there. They are friendly and professional. I went to apply for a credit card. I heard back in one hour. I was accepted. I have never had one problem for them.

I first began using NuVision Credit Union Federal Credit Union in 2012 and, for the most part, I have had a really great experience. I was facing a strenuous issue when I my car broke down in October of that year. What I thought would be a day visit to the mechanics resulted in me finding out that my car had actually died. They were not forthwith with granting me any kind of loan to help me during the interim period while I didn’t have a car. As a result, I had to rent cars for longer than I would have liked. But they have helped me establish my credit and find viable credit card options.… read more

I recently opened checking and savings accounts with USAA. I am extremely pleased with them so far. I had been very happy with the same national bank for close to 20 years, but when a couple of problems arose with them, things went south for me very quickly. I chose USAA because I use the company for my auto and homeowner's insurance,All the services (insurance, banking services, etc.) USAA offered are centered around veterans and our specific needs. I've had nothing but positive experiences with their insurance services, and I can honestly also say the same about my experiences to date with their checking and savings products. I pay no monthly fees; the accounts have no minimum balance, and they extend the same excellent service in their banking division as they do for their insurance policies.The only downside is that you either have to be a veteran or related to one to join. If you are eligible, however, I strongly encourage you to join.… read more

I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union. I have been with them for over 25 years now. When I retired from the Navy out here in San Diego,I was given a lump sum of cash. The first place I went to was NFCU. I was very lucky to pick them as my choice for all of my financial needs. Over the years I can count on one hand how many times that I had a dispute with them. And every time,EVERY time,that I questioned something,they always had an answer for me. The customer service is excellent!! The auto rate loans (I have had 4) are also one of the lowest that you will find out here in san diego. I am a father of 6 and all my kids are with NFCU also. Before you decide on where to put your hard earned money,my suggestion is to give NFCU a call.… read more

A few years ago I totaled my car just a week after paying it off. I was very upset; especially since it was the other person's fault. They ran a stop sign and hit me right on the driver's side door. The car spun several times and I found myself trapped inside. After the accident I could see the other driver and his friends moving his car to make it look like it was my fault. They then tried to move my car with me inside, instead of trying to help me get out. The entire experience was dreadful and the other driver's insurance company refused to pay because of the way the cars had been set up. USAA, however, believed me when I told them what happened. They got me a rental car that very day and I had money to buy a new car with a couple of days. I also got more than I was expecting. Banking, insurance, and savings with USAA is always a good experience!… read more

I have recently had a very frustrating experience with BB&T bank. I applied for a checking account and they said that they would not approve me. They would not give me a reason why or any other information regarding the matter. They would only say that I was not approved for a checking account. I've never had such an experience in my life!

I bank with Webster Bank and have for over 20 years. I am extremely happy with their service and user friendly app and website. I have always felt that my information was secure and my money was in safe hands. I must say I am a person who often misplaces my cards. I am always embarrassed to make the call, once again that I have misplaced my card. They help me as if it was my first time each and every time. Never making me feel embarrassed or insecure even though they can clearly see this has not been my first loss. My children also have opened accounts through them, and their child friendly program is the best!… read more

My bank Is US Bank. A bit like heirlooms, US Bank has been passed down and always used by my family. Recently, i opened a checking account upon my 18th birthday. When signing up at my branch they put a student indicator on my account saying the $8.95 maintenance fee would be waived. For one reason or another it was for about two months then this month it wasn't refunded. I called customer service and they switched me over to a "Easy Student" account which did cost $2 but is waived by online statements. If you ever have an Issue their customer service is top notch and they try hard to help you. Bonus for some: customer service is based in the US so it's all native speakers from here. That personally doesn't matter to me but for older people or folks with trouble understanding international people it would help. The US Bank android app is wonderful and simple. Really my only qualm with US Bank is that their money sending system online is hard and bad from the app. All together, It would be hard to find a better bank then good ol' US Bank.… read more

I bank with USAA. I have used many other banks and find USAA to be better equipped to serve my needs. I bank only online and enjoy that convenience that they offer. I can transfer money, pay bills, make deposits all from my phone or computer even while I'm on the go. I don't have time to go the physical bank. The representatives are always helpful as well. In addition, they offer many discounts on products and services within and out of the bank. I am certain I will never bank with another institution as they are a one-stop shop.… read more

I bank with First Convenience Bank in Central Texas. They are located in all the local Walmarts which is very nice. Recently, I had a very low balance in my account and accidently used my debit card, over drawing my account since the bank does not decline point of sale purchases to costumers in good standing. This caused several over draft charges that amounted to about $100.00 dollars. I went in to my local branch and explained the situation, the woman I was speaking with removed the charges and resolved the issue on the spot. I was very pleased.… read more

I liked that there is no interest rate, and monthly fees are low. I’ve had good experience with customer service so far as well.

I have used Farmers & Merchants Bank in the past when I lived in a different city and I was overall pleased. I had both a checking and savings account with them, and I found their APR rates and policies and terms to be overall fair. I also found their customer service representatives to be very helpful and efficient.

Yes, you can get a loan with tarnished credit, but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk. You should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term. If your accounts have not gone past 90 days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep, or by sending along a 'goodwill' letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late. There are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report, but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts. You should begin by puling your free annual credit report from https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts. Once you have a better picture of where you credit is now, you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you. I would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as Lexington Law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own. You may wish to familiarize yourself with 'credit good will letters' and have a look at the following websites:www.creditboards.comwww.myFico.comGood luck, you will certainly be able to repair your credit in good time!… read more

Woodforest National Bank is perhaps the most useful bank in the country because most of them are located in Walmart stores. This bank has saved me a lot of hassle because I have moved about four times in eight years, and there has been a Woodforest branch in all four of these locations. I don't find their checking account itself to be substantially better than any other checking available at a national bank, but their customer service is ideal, with rapidly moving lines and friendly demeanor in all transactions I've had.… read more

I have been with Credit Union One for about three years and I can honestly say I have never had any problems with them. The one thing I wish that they had was more places I can use an ATM machine that I don't have to pay a fee to use. I like the security that they also offer, I am notified immediately if they question any kind of questionable use on my account, I get emails from them notifying me even if my account is logged into too many times in one day. I am planning on getting a car loan from them in the next month or so, I'm sure they will be a pretty easy process since I already belong with them.… read more

And they are so endearing when they do this during the course of the conversation. I call it human touch. That to me is very polite and courteous disposition of a Bank.… read more

Whenever I call them, they are always friendly and helpful.

I have an account with TDBank North. I am very unhappy with them My account was somehow compromised and money was taken and used without my knowledge. They said it was used with an ATM card but I have the card. I have the card though so the bank is telling me they will not refund the money taken without doing a complete investigation. I understand they need to investigate but I have been a customer for maybe 10 years without any previous issues. They should return the disputed funds until/unless they can find no evidence of a theft. Even then if that happens that would be bad for me because the money really was taken. I would recommend another bank.… read more

We have banked with Vystar and its predecessor Jax Navy Fed C/U for nearly thirty years and have never had any problems with them except one recent event where an apparent unauthorized charge on our debit card appeared from a vendor we hadn't used in six months. Also, on the date of the charge we were not in town, making the charge appear fraudulent. Vystar reversed the charge and began an investigation. After three months and a thoroughly helpful Vystar customer service rep we discovered the charge to be correct. The vendor had taken its time to submit the proper paper work. Must be nice to be in no hurry to get paid.… read more

I bank with Chase Manhattan, just Chase to most and I have to say that every time I go in they are nice, the wait is never very long and the place is always clean. One time I needed $150 in gold dollars for a fundraiser and I went in and they said that most branches usually only have about $50 unless you order them in advance. Well, I didn't have that kind of time. I didn't think I would have to order them. So I told the gal I would just drive to a few banks. She told me to wait while she made a couple calls. When she came back about 5minutes later she said she called the bank next door (an independent credit union) and that they had what I needed and someone would bring them right over! Within 10 minutes I was out the door and didn't have to drive all over town! They always go the extra mile when I need them to. Plus hardly any fees and a good interest rate...all the boring things..haha..makes this a great bank I will stay with for years and years!… read more

My deciding factor in choosing Green Dot was how user friendly and easy the card is to use.

It does cost monthly, but the ease and flexibility are worth it!

I have been banking with one local credit union in San Antonio - Generations FCU - since 2003. It has expanded and acquired more branches since the time I opened my accounts with them. I definitely like their interest rates on loans and very straight-forward membership fees and policies. Overdraft and other account fees are way cheaper than in major banks. My account is free, because I have a direct deposit. The new location is very close to my house. I was able to get several car loans through them at a very low rate and still have a line of credit.… read more

This put my account into the negative. I discussed this with the bank and showed them my receipt which did state that I did not agree to the charge. After a call with the bank manager it was agreed that this was an unintentional mix-up an overdraft was not charged. At least they made it right.… read more

We changed from a different back to WPCU about ten years ago and have had no issues with their banking or service. We have done multiple home refinances and auto loans as the fee structures and rates tend to be the best. The staff is knowledgeable and made every effort to advise us of changing and best rates. One of the better benefits is not being constantly hit with numerous fees for the privilege of banking with them. The only negative that I have is the lack of locations to do ATM transactions. On the flip side, if I have to use a out of network ATM, WPCU allows me to recover the cost of the transaction. So, they do almost everything right to earn and keep my business.… read more

Allegacy Federal Credit Union is a southeastern credit union that provides outstanding service. The company is extremely conservative with credit lending decisions.

I have had an Capital One 360 account for about 6 months and I can honestly say I have never been so pleased with a bank before. For those of you who don't know, CO 360 is an online-based banking experience. I moved to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee where there are mostly Credit Unions and very few big banks, so I decided to open a CO 360 account. You can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them with your phone; you can do Person2Person transfers and if the receiver also has Capital One the transfer is instant (Example: I told my roommate to get us Taco Bell on the way home and transferred $15 to her, which she received immediately). They also give you the option of opening as many savings accounts as you'd like, and even have an automatic-savings plan where you choose how much to put in each savings account every month. Whenever I call the bank for any questions or assistance, a customer service representative answers IMMEDIATELY. No confusing and misleading menus! I recommend it to everyone. Did I mention there's no annual fees or minimums?… read more

When I lived in New York I was drawn to TD Bank for their flexible hours (closed at 7pm, open on Sundays). That worked great for a while until my student privileges expired. They would charge me $5 if I didn't have a minimum of $50 in the account. There were also no TD Banks or ATMs in the Brooklyn area, and they would charge you $2 if you withdrew money at a non-TD Bank ATM. In the end I realized this bank was established for rich, Wall Street people and closed my account.… read more

I have a Bank Account with Fifth Third Bank. I absolutely love this bank. The only downfall was the opening deposit amount of $50 because I was just getting back on my feet. At the time I opened my account with them, I had terrible credit due to a separation that I had recently went through. I was trying to get my life back in order and I was denied an account by almost every bank. Fifth Third Bank offered me a second chance with their second chance checking. I opened my second chance checking account and began to use it wisely. After six months of continuous responsible checking with Fifth Third Bank they helped me get approved for a small personal loan to help rebuild my credit. They also offer an identity Theft program that is a great tool to alert you when something looks suspicious. I love Fifth Third Bank!… read more

I had a Bank account with Huntington some time back and at first things seemed all on the up and up, Then Their was a problem with a transfer. I tried to call customer service and was on hold for at least 30-45 minutes and then finally got threw the person on the other end was extremely rude and said they were transferring me to another department. The customer service person failed to mention before transferring me that that department was not even open. Very frustrating and I didn't want to have to wait another 45 minutes on hold again. So anyone who don't like to wait and anyone who don't make $100,000 or more a year should not bank with Huntington.… read more

I was a day late. I spoke with the manager about waving the NSF fee since it was my first time and I was a valued customer. She politely said no. Therefore, I not only had that check bounce, but another check bounced as well. I had to pay two NSF fees and was unable to cover my bills because of it.

I've had a bank account in Idaho central credit union bank since last year. The main issue with the bank is the hidden charges which they never tell you about while you are opening an account with them.For transactions that you do overseas they are going to charge $5 as processing fees which other reputed banks are not.Also if for 3 months you don't deposit any money they are going to charge you for that.In my opinion this information should be given to customers prior to opening the account.… read more

I switched to Huntington bank this year because it does not hassle me with service fees, and it is close to the university I will be attending. I love how Huntington is open every day of the week. It is convenient for people who work during the week and can only make it to the bank on the weekend. Overall I am satisfied with this service. My biggest issue is that checks take several days to clear and the bankers can be a bit pushy when they are trying to sell the bank's credit card. For instance, when I walked into the bank the first time after opening an account, the banker I worked with skipped hellos and immediately asked if I was still considering the credit card even though I told him no last time. Usually the staff is friendly and takes care of my needs quickly when I visit, however.… read more

I currently have 5/3 Bank for my checking and savings account, as well as, for a mortgage loan. We chose this bank primarily because of location (right across the street from our previous address). We have never had any issues with them and I have always found their customer service to be excellent (kind, considerate, respectful, pleasant and attentive to my needs). Setting up the mortgage with them and our accounts was easy breezy. The only issue we have with them now is that they are not nearby so we have to travel some ways to get to them now that we relocated. It would be nice if they upgraded to things such as taking a pic of a check and utilizing those tools like Chase does. Outside of that, I do recommend this bank to anyone who is searching for a new bank.… read more

I applied for a home mortgage at Mountain West Bank in Idaho. It turned into a miserable experience. The first mortgage broker took all my information and started to shop for rates. Two anxious weeks later he told me that no one wanted my mortgage. I have great credit and 50% down payment but because it was a rural home with minimal fire protection (the home is on forest service land) no one wanted the loan. I talked to a second loan officer at Mountain West who said that he had other contacts to check. Another long week of waiting and no response. When I started to call these loan officers back they didn't want to take my calls. Very disappointing. I would not recommend doing business with them in the future.… read more

I have an account at First Financial Credit Union for over 5 years.I am really impressed with the customer service that the bank used to offer till last year. Currently their response time is very high.Last month i lost a cheque for which i called the customer service for cancellation. I was surprised to know that their lead time for same is 2 days while others are offering 2 hours. I suggest you not have an account at this bank.… read more

I have been using ING Direct for over 10 years. I have never run into any problems banking with them. One time I got locked out of my account and needed to retrieve my password, so I contacted their customer service. They were extremely helpful and got everything back in order on the same day. They are also quick to reply if you decide to send them messages. Choosing ING Direct all those years ago was a smart one, they have excellent service and have yet to disappoint.… read more

I recently opened up an account with Woodforest National Bank. I have had this account for less than a year, but I can already tell that this bank stands out among the others because it truly cares about its banking customers. Checks deposited to your account are available immediately. Even checks deposited through ATM are available the same day - within the hour. There is no ridiculous holding process for larger checks or deposited funds. The tellers are always friendly and happy to help. The only complaint that I have would be the number of locations in the Houston area, inner loop. One important aspect of your bank is number of locations. Direct deposit works for me now, but any time I need to be physically present for any banking, I do have to hunt down a location.… read more

Citibank. During my younger corporate years, I was delinquent with my credit card payments at one point. Couple of years after, I was unexpectedly approved for a Citibank Visa credit card. I must say that their application assessment is thorough and they give considerations or chances for young professionals to reestablish their credit.

I live in Canada and have all my banking with TD Canada Trust. We opted the bank as it has the best customer service. It also provides service during weekends and holidays which is very helpful for working people. Also they have financial advisers who provide all the liable options for banking to us to choose. They provide answers to all our questions and will have a very friendly relation with the customers.

Around one year ago I opened an account at a local Busey Bank, in my home city. It´s not a very well-known bank, but it´s close to my home and, so far, I´ve had no problem with it. The bank features a no minimum balance requirement, with the sole condition of getting the statements on-line. It offers debit and credit cards, online banking, mobile and direct deposit, and its customer service is excellent. The only detail I´m a little bit disappointed with is the fact that every time I sign-in online I have to wait for an E-mail with an access code, but that problem is a minor one. The problem lies on the fact that, I don´t know why, the system is unable to recognize my computer. It´s somehow a bargain, but nothing compared to the possibilities it features.… read more

MidFirst Bank has been the best bank I've ever used. The fact that they allow you to use any ATM and not charge you a fee is the most solid choice for going with them. They always make you feel welcome every time you visit their locations. The only negative experience I have had with them is putting a hold on my account for a purchase I made for $2. I appreciate the fact that a bank will look out for you but it caused a problem when I didn't know and I was trying to make a purchase. I guess I would've appreciated a phone call or an email telling me that they put a hold on the account...and did a $2 purchase for something unusual really warrant a hold? Other than that, great bank and I will be a member for years to come!… read more

Boeing Employee Credit Union, is the bank that I'll be mentioning today. Don't get me wrong, but this bank is great, but there are incidents that made me decide to switch to other banks. This bank only gave me about 5 mobile transfer actions per month which was far less than what I would prefer because I like to make transfers from my savings to checking account to make sure I had enough funds for what I wanted to buy. I also use my mobile banking system a lot so it was a serious problem I had with this bank.… read more

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 04/26/2012
            

                BBB has determined that Independence Trust Company meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

*Attorneys who only have peer reviews prior to April 15, 2008 are not displayed.









Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

No representation is made that the quality of legal services to be performed is greater than the quality of legal services performed by other lawyers. Testimonials or endorsements in any review do not constitute a guarantee, warranty, or prediction regarding the outcome of your legal matter. Past results are not a guarantee of any future results as each case must be decided on its own merits. Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.
