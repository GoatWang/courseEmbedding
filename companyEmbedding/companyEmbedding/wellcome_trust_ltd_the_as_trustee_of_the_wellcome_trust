About us









Wellcome exists to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive.
We’re a global charitable foundation, both politically and financially independent. We support scientists and researchers, take on big problems, fuel imaginations, and spark debate.





Watch our video about the power of asking questions




We value breadth and depth in the activities we support
We remain true to the vision and values of our founder, Sir Henry Wellcome, a medical entrepreneur, collector and philanthropist. Our work today reflects the amazing breadth of Henry's interests, and his belief that science and research expand knowledge by testing and investigating ideas. Our governance is based on an updated version of his will.
Our funding supports over 14,000 people in more than 70 countries. In the next five years, we aim to spend up to £5 billion helping thousands of curious, passionate people all over the world explore ideas in science, population health, medical innovation, the humanities and social sciences and public engagement.
For example, one of the world’s biggest challenges is how to be better prepared for the next major epidemic. We take on this problem in many different ways – here are just a handful:
Vaccine development, such as when we co-funded the development of a new Ebola vaccinePublic health interventions, such as insecticide-treated bednets for malariaBehavioural projects, such as training health workers to reduce risk of infection while working on the frontlineSocial science, including research into the ethics of medical trials involving pregnant women, of urgent importance because of the Zika virus.Developing research leaders in regions most affected by infectious disease (as we’ve done through our DELTAS Africa initiative)Advocacy, encouraging governments and global businesses to take part in building a more secure future for global healthWe bring these activities together to make a difference
When we can, we bring together different people and strands of activity to create something greater than the sum of its parts.
Sometimes that means backing an idea in the laboratory, and then helping it develop into a new treatment or approach to patient care.
For example, the idea for how to prevent mitochondrial disease – a devastating genetic illness passed from mother to child – came after years of scientific research to understand the basic biology of mitochondria and what happens when they don’t work properly.
The development of new IVF techniques for preventing it followed, and our policy and campaign work to promote change means that UK law now allows these techniques to be considered for use.
At other times, we take an interdisciplinary approach from the start. The Hub, for example, is a specially designed space where researchers and other creative minds can collaborate. Created Out of Mind, a group exploring dementia, are our Hub residents until 2018.
A network including scientists, artists, clinicians, public health experts and broadcasters will examine and challenge perceptions of dementia through scientific and creative experiments, collaborations and public events. We can take the long view, while also acting flexibly
We have a £20.9bn investment portfolio, which funds all the work we do. This allows us to plan for the long-term, while having the independence to act flexibly and responsively.
We've funded the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute since 1993. It played a key role in the Human Genome Project, mapping 30% of the human DNA sequence as part of an international collaboration. Our backing kept the results public, which meant researchers could freely – and permanently – access the data. Today, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute continues to be a world leader in genome research.
We run Wellcome Collection, a free destination in central London that’s open to everyone. Wellcome Collection is also the home of Wellcome Library, one of the world’s best resources for the study of medical history.
These long-term investments – and many others – ensure discoveries and knowledge are freely available to all for generations to come.We work with others to reach our goals
We work with academia, philanthropy, business, governments and civil society around the world.
With this network of people and partner organisations, we can achieve more than would be possible on our own. We might not always succeed, but we are committed to being as daring, open and ambitious as we can be in our efforts to improve health and make life better.We want to hear from you

Our strategy

This framework sets out how we plan to improve health, through three complementary approaches across science, research, and engagement with society.
It builds on our 2010 Strategic Plan and has no fixed time-frame. It includes six initial priority areas.
It allows us to adapt as new ideas and challenges arise, drawing on insights from 80 years of achievement and our broad network of experts.
It also allows us to respond quickly in a crisis, as we did to support new vaccines for Ebola.
Find out more about our philosophy and the strategic framework below, or read more about how they shape what we do.
Our philosophy
Good health makes life better. We want to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive.
Science and research expand knowledge by testing and investigating ideas. This new understanding can be applied to health, and change medicine, behaviour and society.
That’s why we support thousands of curious, passionate people all over the world to explore great ideas, at every step of the way from discovery to impact.
Together, we can do more. We can drive reform to ensure that ideas can reach their full potential. And we can give focused, intensive support when we see real opportunities to transform lives.
As an independent charitable foundation, we’re willing to take risks. We combine the ability to act swiftly with long-term ambition.
That’s how we make life better.
1. Advancing ideas
Better health needs great new ideas. The richest sources of these ideas are the people who dedicate themselves to discovery, creativity and innovation. We are always open to proposals and ready to respond to the best.
Supporting ideas has always been central to our approach, and it will always account for the majority of our funding. We also stimulate ideas and pursue many of our own.
The research we support continues to address fundamental health challenges of our time, across discovery science, medical innovation, and the humanities and social sciences.
We give grants to people and teams, and for places and resources, as well as providing seed funding, through our recently updated set of funding schemes.
We support researchers at the start of a career and at every stage that follows, as well as creative people, teachers and others who put health and science at the heart of everyday conversation.
We develop leaders and advocate policy change. And we can adapt our support quickly and flexibly, to meet fresh needs at times of unexpected opportunity or challenge.
2. Seizing opportunities
We’ve long supported people with great ideas, and we always will. Beyond that, we identify times when our concerted intervention can accelerate progress towards better health.
We do this by providing focused, intensive support that creates a step change over five to ten years.
Sometimes, we see potential in connecting people we support. At other times, we will stimulate a new field of endeavour, or invest in new technology that drives discovery.
In each case, we identify a critical need and set ambitious goals. We connect experts from different research disciplines, build partnerships, and lead advocacy, policy development, communications and public engagement.
The challenges we choose to pursue are often tough and complex. Not every effort will succeed. But those that do will transform lives.
We’ve identified four priority areas: drug-resistant infections, Our Planet, Our Health, research ecosystems in Africa and Asia and vaccines.
3. Driving reform
We have learned so much from the people and organisations we work with around the world. This helps us to recognise practices that enable ideas to reach their full potential – and barriers that stand in their way.
Our record in areas like open access to research results, public engagement, and research careers has earned us the credibility to challenge ways of working, and to propose better alternatives.
We will promote change – leading by example, convening alliances, and campaigning for wider reform. We can move quickly to address an urgent challenge, or think long to build lasting agreement.
We’ve identified two priority areas: diversity and inclusion and improving science education.
