Borrow Responsibly
We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.


This information is for borrowers attending degree-granting institutions only. You must be attending or have attended a participating school located in the U.S. during an eligible prior enrollment period. You must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident or a Non-U.S. citizen borrower with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident) and required U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) documentation.  U.S. citizens and permanent residents enrolled in eligible study abroad programs or who are attending or have attended schools located outside the U.S. are also eligible.  Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000.  Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.


Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are higher than interest rates for the Interest Repayment Option. You're charged interest starting at disbursement, while in school and during your six-month separation or grace period. When you enter principal and interest repayment, Unpaid Interest will be added to your loan's Current Principal. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a freshman with no other Sallie Mae loans.  


Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount.

Smart Option Student Loan® for Undergraduate Students






For bachelor's and associate's degrees or a certificate at a degree-granting school
Apply for this loan






Yes!


Apply for this loan

Questions? Call us at 877-279-7172.
Our free college planning resources may help you find more ways to pay for college. Your school's financial aid office may also be able to help.





We're sorry! Something isn't working right.
You can try again later, or call us at 877-279-7172.


When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren't enough, get the money you need to help pay for your undergraduate education. The "option" in the Smart Option Student Loan name means you can choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you.


Choose a variable or fixed undergraduate student loan interest rate


Variable interest rate:   3.25% - 10.22% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting undergraduate student loan interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total student loan cost.
Consideration
Your student loan interest rate can rise or fall as the market index changes, so your undergraduate student loan payments may vary over time.


Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 11.85% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable undergraduate student loan monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn't change over time.
Consideration
You may pay more for your total student loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.



Choosing which is better for you, a variable or a fixed interest rate
Deciding between a variable or a fixed interest rate is a personal choice. It’s important to review the benefits and considerations of each. When you apply, you’ll see how much your payments may be with each interest rate type, which can help you choose.
Why there is a range of interest rates
Unlike a federal loan, a private student loan is credit-based. We look at your creditworthiness and your cosigner’s, if you apply with one. With this information, along with other factors, we determine the rate that you’ll be offered within the range. 


Pay it back now or later


Deferred repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






No payments
Principal & interest

Make no scheduled student loan payments while you're in school and in grace (six months after leaving school).*
With this undergraduate student loan repayment option, you’ll likely pay more for your total loan cost, since the interest rate may be higher and unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Fixed repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






$25 a month**
Principal & interest

Pay $25 every month** you're in school and in grace, and you can save an average of 12%*** on your total undergraduate student loan cost when compared to our deferred repayment option.*
While your total loan cost will be less than with our deferred repayment option, unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Interest repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






Pay interest monthly
Principal & interest

Pay interest every month you're in school and in grace. Your interest rate will be 1 percentage point lower than with our deferred repayment option* and you can save an average of 25%*** on your total student loan cost, compared to our deferred repayment option.
Your undergraduate student loan payments will likely be larger while you're in school and in grace, but your total loan cost will likely be lower than with the other repayment options.




How repayment options affect your loan













Choosing the repayment option that’s best for you
If you prefer to hold off making payments until you leave school (and are willing to pay more over the life of your private student loan), consider the deferred option. If you can make payments while you’re in school, the fixed or interest repayment options may be a good choice for you—either one will generally lower your total loan cost vs the deferred option. 
During the application process, you’ll see a comparison of the estimated monthly payments and total loan cost for each option, which should help you choose the best one for your needs.
How much should you borrow for your undergraduate student loan
If you’re unsure about the amount you should borrow, start with your school’s cost of attendance and subtract your savings, scholarships, grants, work-study, and federal loans. What’s left, your “gap,” is the amount of money that you still need for college. Borrow only what you can afford to pay back, given your estimated starting monthly salary after you graduate.

Borrower or cosigner must enroll in auto debit through Sallie Mae.

Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount.


Borrowers and cosigners may receive their FICO® Score quarterly after the first disbursement of their loan.  FICO® Scores are delivered only to borrowers and cosigners who have an available score, are based on data from TransUnion, and may be different from other credit scores. This benefit may change or end in the future.  FICO® is a registered trademark of the Fair Isaac Corporation in the United States and other countries.

Note on loan refunds: The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed directly to the school on behalf of the student. Refunds will be handled within your school’s current process and in some cases, your school may refund loan funds directly to the student.

Nonprofit Overview

Causes: 

Financial Institutions
Mission: The pheaa student loan foundation, inc. , a non-stock, nonprofit corporation incorporated under pennsylvania's nonprofit corporation law of 1988, as amended (the "foundation"), is organized to carry out student loan securitization transactions for the benefit of, or to carry out the purposes of, the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency ("pheaa"), a state agency of the commonwealth of pennsylvania ("commonwealth"), created and controlled by the commonwealth's legislature. The foundation's exempt purpose is to facilitate the securitization of pheaa-owned student loan in order to raise funds for pheaa so that it may continue to make, service and buy low-cost student loans and to otherwise improve higher educational opportunities for students in pennsylvania, thereby lessening the burdens of government. 
Programs: As of the end of the reporting period, in furtherance of its purposes, the foundation had formed the nine special-purpose delaware statutory trusts, (collectively, the "trusts"), each of the trusts issued notes in the amounts set forth below, and used substantially all of the proceeds to finance the purchase of student loans which serve as collateral for the repayment of such notes: pheaa student loan trust i ("trust i")- $1,200,000,000. 00 (various)(issued in three $400,000,000. 00 series: 2003-1,2004-1, 2005-1) pheaa student loan trust 2011-1 ("trust 2011-1")- $1,676,400,000. 00 (7/14/11) pheaa student loan trust 2012-1 ("trust 2012-1")- $ 536,400,000. 00 (11/14/12) pheaa student loan trust 2013-1 ("trust 2013-1")- $ 583,950,000. 00 (6/12/13) pheaa student loan trust 2013-2 ("trust 2013-2")- $ 331,300,000. 00 (7/30/13) pheaa student loan trust 2013-3 ("trust 2013-3")- $ 517,850,000. 00 (11/20/13) pheaa student loan trust 2014-1 ('trust 2014-1")- $ 573,800,000. 00 (3/14/14) pheaa student loan trust 2014-2 ("trust 2014-2")- $ 611,850,000. 00 (6/17/14) pheaa warehouse facility trust 2013-1 ("warehouse trust 2013-1")- this entity was created to facilitate short term financing for student loans, from time to time, in an amount up to $700,000. 000. 00 during the current fiscal year. In addition, the foundation had formed the following three limited liability companies: (collectively, the "llcs", and each, individually, an "llc") pheaa student loan company, llc ("slc i") pheaa student loan company ii, llc ("slc ii") pheaa student loan company iii, llc ("slc iii") each of the llcs participated in the issuance and sale of notes through the straight-a funding conduit program to finance the purchase of student loans which served as collateral for the notes. The notes issued by each llc were paid in full by the end of the reporting period. The foundation retained residual interests in the assets transferred to each of the foregoing entities. However, as a cash-basis taxpayer, the foundation does not recognize its residual interests as revenue until associated cash is received/realized by the foundation. The foundation intends to distribute to pheaa, from time to time, such cash flows, net of expenses. Pheaa has advised that such cash distributions and other benefits it receives from the foundation's activities will be used to further pheaa's statutory mission thereby lessening the burdens of government.

State Grant Update
The Pennsylvania General Assembly appropriates funds to PHEAA for the Pennsylvania State Grant Program.  Please note that any 2017-18 award amounts listed in the student portal (Account Access) are not final.  PHEAA is unable to finalize this information until the PA Commonwealth budget is signed.


Apply/Renew Now

A grant is a type of financial aid award that you don't need to repay, as long as you meet all of the eligibility requirements.


Prepare
Before you apply for a Pennsylvania State Grant, find out whether you meet the eligibility requirements and how much money you can expect to receive.


Apply/Renew
To be considered for a Pennsylvania State Grant, you must fill out the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and complete the Pennsylvania State Grant Form. Most renewal students do not have to complete the State Grant Form.


After You Apply/Renew
Sign in to your Account Access mailbox to view your Pennsylvania State Grant status or to make changes to your school and/or program information. If you are a renewal applicant, make sure your information is up to date.

Our Mission


Support our mission by creating your own fundraiser.  If you're as passionate about our cause as we are, it'd be amazing if you created a fundraiser on CrowdRise to raise money for our Charity. CrowdRise makes it super easy and fun, and your support is invaluable to our mission.  Consider giving up your next birthday by asking for donations instead of gifts.  Or run a marathon and ask your friends to sponsor you. We love getting donations but there's nothing better than when you go a step further and help us raise money from your network of friends. Lots of little donations really do add up.  The power of the crowd is real.   Please create a fundraiser and help us make a real-life difference for this incredibly important cause.

Get started








Borrow Responsibly
We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.


This information is for borrowers attending degree-granting institutions only. You must be attending or have attended a participating school located in the U.S. during an eligible prior enrollment period. You must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident or a Non-U.S. citizen borrower with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident) and required U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) documentation.  U.S. citizens and permanent residents enrolled in eligible study abroad programs or who are attending or have attended schools located outside the U.S. are also eligible.  Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000.  Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.


Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are higher than interest rates for the Interest Repayment Option. You're charged interest starting at disbursement, while in school and during your six-month separation or grace period. When you enter principal and interest repayment, Unpaid Interest will be added to your loan's Current Principal. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a freshman with no other Sallie Mae loans.  


Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount.


Information advertised valid as of 6/26/2017.


WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. CHECK SALLIEMAE.COM FOR THE MOST UP-TO-DATE PRODUCT INFORMATION.

Our free college planning resources may help you find more ways to pay for college. Your school's financial aid office may also be able to help.










We're sorry! Something isn't working right.
You can try again later, or call us at 877-279-7172.


When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren’t enough, your good credit lets you give the gift of education, so you can reduce the financial pressure on your student. Get a loan in your own name that lets you choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you. 
 



Choose a variable or fixed interest rate


Variable interest rate:   4.75% - 11.12% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total loan cost.
Consideration
Your interest rate can rise or fall as the market index changes, so your Parent Loan payments may vary over time.


Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 12.87% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn't change over time.
Consideration
You may pay more for your total loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.




Choose how you want to pay it back



Interest repayment option



In school


After school






Pay interest monthly(up to 48 months)
Principal & interest

Get budget flexibility—make interest-only payments while your student is in school for up to 48 months, and then principal and interest payments for 10 years.**
It will take longer to pay off your Parent Loan than with the principal and interest repayment option.

Principal and interest repayment option



In school


After school






Principal & interest
Principal & interest

You can pay off your loan faster by making principal and interest payments while your student is in school and your total Parent Loan cost will likely be lower, compared to the interest repayment option.
Your monthly Parent Loan payments will likely be higher while your student is in school, compared to the interest repayment option.




Note on loan refunds: The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed directly to the school on behalf of the student. Refunds will be handled within your school’s current process and in some cases, your school may refund loan funds directly to the student. If that occurs, the borrower and cosigner (if applicable) would still be responsible for repaying that amount to Sallie Mae. 






*



APRs for the Principal and Interest Repayment Option are higher than APRs for the Interest Repayment Option. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a borrower (on behalf of a freshman student) with no other Sallie Mae loans. 
**


This repayment example is based on a typical loan to a borrower (on behalf of a student) who chooses a variable rate and the Interest Repayment Option for a $10,000 loan, with two disbursements, and a 8.99% variable APR. It works out to 4 payments of $37.50, 44 payments of $75.00, 119 payments of $127.14 and one payment of $94.31, for a Total Loan Cost of $18,673.97. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.

Borrow Responsibly
We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.


This information is for borrowers with students attending degree-granting institutions only. The student is not eligible to be a borrower or cosigner and must be attending or have attended a participating school during an eligible prior enrollment period, or be enrolled in an eligible study abroad program. The borrower, cosigner, and student must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents. The school may refund loan funds directly to the student, and if that occurs, borrower and cosigner (if applicable) would still be responsible for repaying that amount to Sallie Mae. Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000.  Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.




Borrower or cosigner must enroll in auto debit through Sallie Mae. The rate reduction benefit applies only during active repayment for as long as the Current Amount Due or Designated Amount is successfully withdrawn from the authorized bank account each month, and may therefore be suspended during a forbearance  or deferment period. 


Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school certified amount.


Borrowers and cosigners may receive their FICO® Score quarterly after the first disbursement of their loan.  FICO® Scores are delivered only to borrowers and cosigners who have an available score, are based on data from TransUnion, and may be different from other credit scores. This benefit may change or end in the future.  FICO® is a registered trademark of the Fair Isaac Corporation in the United States and other countries.


For more information, see IRS Publication 970 or consult a tax advisor.


Sallie Mae Parent Loans are made by Sallie Mae Bank or a lender partner.

When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren't enough, get the money you need to help pay for your undergraduate education. The "option" in the Smart Option Student Loan name means you can choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you.


Choose a variable or fixed undergraduate student loan interest rate


Variable interest rate:   3.25% - 10.22% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting undergraduate student loan interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total student loan cost.
Consideration
Your student loan interest rate can rise or fall as the market index changes, so your undergraduate student loan payments may vary over time.


Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 11.85% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable undergraduate student loan monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn't change over time.
Consideration
You may pay more for your total student loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.



Choosing which is better for you, a variable or a fixed interest rate
Deciding between a variable or a fixed interest rate is a personal choice. It’s important to review the benefits and considerations of each. When you apply, you’ll see how much your payments may be with each interest rate type, which can help you choose.
Why there is a range of interest rates
Unlike a federal loan, a private student loan is credit-based. We look at your creditworthiness and your cosigner’s, if you apply with one. With this information, along with other factors, we determine the rate that you’ll be offered within the range. 


Pay it back now or later


Deferred repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






No payments
Principal & interest

Make no scheduled student loan payments while you're in school and in grace (six months after leaving school).*
With this undergraduate student loan repayment option, you’ll likely pay more for your total loan cost, since the interest rate may be higher and unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Fixed repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






$25 a month**
Principal & interest

Pay $25 every month** you're in school and in grace, and you can save an average of 12%*** on your total undergraduate student loan cost when compared to our deferred repayment option.*
While your total loan cost will be less than with our deferred repayment option, unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Interest repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






Pay interest monthly
Principal & interest

Pay interest every month you're in school and in grace. Your interest rate will be 1 percentage point lower than with our deferred repayment option* and you can save an average of 25%*** on your total student loan cost, compared to our deferred repayment option.
Your undergraduate student loan payments will likely be larger while you're in school and in grace, but your total loan cost will likely be lower than with the other repayment options.




How repayment options affect your loan













Choosing the repayment option that’s best for you
If you prefer to hold off making payments until you leave school (and are willing to pay more over the life of your private student loan), consider the deferred option. If you can make payments while you’re in school, the fixed or interest repayment options may be a good choice for you—either one will generally lower your total loan cost vs the deferred option. 
During the application process, you’ll see a comparison of the estimated monthly payments and total loan cost for each option, which should help you choose the best one for your needs.
How much should you borrow for your undergraduate student loan
If you’re unsure about the amount you should borrow, start with your school’s cost of attendance and subtract your savings, scholarships, grants, work-study, and federal loans. What’s left, your “gap,” is the amount of money that you still need for college. Borrow only what you can afford to pay back, given your estimated starting monthly salary after you graduate.

Students may have the option to apply for a Discover student loan with a creditworthy cosignercreditworthy cosigner. By applying with a creditworthy cosigner, you may improve your likelihood for loan approval and may receive a lower interest rate.

Undergraduate Loan Repayment


1.  What is a deferment period?

If you are in school at least half-time, on active military duty, serving a public service organization or in a medical residency, you may qualify for a deferment. A deferment period is a period of time when a borrower is not required to make any payments. During deferment, interest will continue to accrue. At the end of a deferment period, any unpaid interest will be added to your principal balance. This may increase the amount of your monthly payments and the total cost of your loan(s).
Learn More 



2.  What is my repayment period?

A repayment period is the period of time during which scheduled payments are required to be made to repay the principal balance and interest on a loan. Your repayment period is 15 years after the deferment period ends.



3.  What are my repayment options?


In-School - Required to make $25 fixed, monthly payments while you are in-school and during your grace period to lower your overall loan cost.
Deferred - Monthly payments are not required until 6 months after you graduate or your enrollment drops below half-time.

ABOUT US




At Student Loan Debt Solution, we are proud to help college graduates with repayment of their loans so they can start their new lives and new careers with no big worries and less stress. We believe that everyone should have the right to higher education, but scholarships, grants and saved funds usually aren’t enough so students must take out education loans.


	Through the William D. Ford Act, many students have received their loans with lower interest rates and have the peace of mind of knowing their loans are backed by the United States Federal Government Department of Education. While this has helped decrease the amount of debt students have overall, it can still be necessary to need help paying off your debt.

	 


		What We Offer

		 

Student Loan Debt Solution has a combined 20 years of experience working in the financial industry and our staff can help you by guiding you into the right path. We provide a lot of research on different programs that can help and can even handle all the preparation of documents to finalize the process.

So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
