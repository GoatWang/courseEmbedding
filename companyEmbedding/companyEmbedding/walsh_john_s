John Edward Walsh, Jr. (born December 26, 1945) is an American television personality, criminal investigator, human and victim rights advocate, and the host, as well as creator,[1] of America's Most Wanted. Walsh is known for his anti-crime activism, with which he became involved following the murder of his son, Adam, in 1981; in 2008, the late serial killer Ottis Toole was named as the killer of Walsh's son.[2] Walsh was part owner of the now defunct Museum of Crime & Punishment in Washington, D.C. He also anchors an investigative documentary series, The Hunt with John Walsh, which debuted on CNN in 2014.

Early years[edit]
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York.[3] He attended the University at Buffalo.[4] After college and marriage to the former Revé Drew in 1971, the newlywed Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.
Murder of Adam Walsh[edit]
Main article: Murder of Adam Walsh
In the summer of 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas,[5] and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall, across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam's case released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store.[6] Adam has been thought to be one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal 120 miles (190 km) away from home. His other remains were never recovered.[7]
Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case in the nearly three decades since the murder, but that of serial killer Ottis Toole most persistently nagged detectives. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole's home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an America's Most Wanted statement on February 6, 2007.[8]
The prime suspect in Adam's abduction and murder, Toole, who died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes, was officially identified as the killer on December 16, 2008 by the Hollywood Police Department, and the case was considered closed.[9] Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.
Aftermath[edit]
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform.[10] The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.
The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John's and Revé's efforts eventually led to the creation of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984.
Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims' rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims' rights.
The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Pub.L. 109–248) was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress and was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for not registering as a sex offender following release into society, and access by citizens to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong Scarlet Letter, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.
By the late 1980s, many malls, department stores, supermarkets, and other such retailers have adopted what is known as a "Code Adam," a movement first started by Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. A "Code Adam" is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. "Code Adam" as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an "Amber Alert," which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.
Career in television[edit]
John and Revé Walsh were portrayed by actors Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams in Adam, a 1983 NBC television film dramatizing the days following Adam's disappearance. The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing. Later, a sequel called Adam: His Song Continues was produced and aired.




John Walsh presents a fugitive on America's Most Wanted


After securing a deal with Fox, Walsh launched America's Most Wanted in 1988. By that time, Walsh was already well known because of the murder of his son and his subsequent actions to help missing and exploited children. America's Most Wanted was the longest-running crime reality show in Fox's history and had contributed to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives. Fox canceled the series in June 2011, but aired four specials during the 2011-12 season. On December 2, 2011, the series returned as a regular weekly first-run series on Lifetime. The last episode aired on October 12, 2012; five months later, in March 2013, Lifetime officially canceled the series.
Walsh also hosted his own daytime talk show, The John Walsh Show, which aired in syndication (mostly on NBC-owned and affiliated stations, as NBC produced the series) from 2002 to 2004.[11]
In July 2005, Walsh attempted to assist the family of missing teen Natalee Holloway. Walsh was critical of the Aruban crime investigation and, along with television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, urged Americans to boycott Aruba. Walsh was a special guest on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired on August 14, 2005. The episode visited the home of Colleen Nick, who is the parent of Morgan Nick, a six-year-old girl who has been missing since 1995. Walsh has featured the Morgan Nick case on America's Most Wanted several times.
His life story was featured on The E! True Hollywood Story and Biography.
Walsh is now the host of The Hunt with John Walsh. The program, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN/US, is similar to America's Most Wanted.[12]
Family[edit]
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (born 1982), Callahan (born 1987), and Hayden (born 1994).
Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that "there is no substitute for Adam." She also said "Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister." Meghan is currently a singer, fashion designer and resides in Vero Beach with her daughter Eva.[13]
Hayden sometimes accompanies his father when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On the show of July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, Larry King said that Hayden resembled Adam.[13]
Tributes[edit]
In 2002, rapper Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony wrote a song for the show (AMW) and dedicated it to Adam and John Walsh, encouraging abduction survivors not to keep their abductions a secret, as Bizzy Bone did after being abducted in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
On August 15, 2006, John Walsh's hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.[14]
In 2005, John Walsh appeared as himself in Outsiders #18 (January 2005), a comic book series published by DC Comics[citation needed]. In the story, written by Judd Winick, Walsh aided the eponymous superhero team in going public on America's Most Wanted with information regarding a child slave trader, which eventually led to a solid lead gained from the tips that poured in.
For a few years in the early 1990s, due to his presence on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with reminder to call 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.[citation needed]
In October 2008, John Walsh was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.[15] for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.[16]
Controversy[edit]
John Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he jokingly told senators to implant "exploding" chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, "I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message." Walsh stated this was a "joke," but that "nobody thought it was funny."[17] Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.[18]
John Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. "It's not a witch hunt," he said. "It's all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who's more likely to molest a child? A male."[19]
In his book Tears of Rage, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York.[20] Critics of Adam Walsh Act have pointed out that, had he been convicted, Walsh himself would be subject to sex offender registration under the law which he aggressively promoted.
Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic by using his publicity.[21] Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is "littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children",[22] when in fact, later Department of Justice study from 1999 found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, of which about 50 resulted in death or child not being found.[23] Critics claim that Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated 1.5 million dollars annually following his testimony before the Congress.[22]

Then one night Tom Roche was sitting around in my place and picked up a copy of that day’s Buffalo Evening News. It was a picture of Reve, who had just won an art contest. ‘Holy Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,’ Tom said. ‘There is a picture of Reve in the paper, John, and she's 16 years old.’ But you know, she had this way about her. She had a certain presence. And after awhile I just got over how young she was. She was way more sophisticated than anybody in her high school and she always dated older guys. She had a fake ID. That's how she got into Brunner’s. She was born with high school. She was into art and her horses. And even then, she always seemed very… I don't know, serene.

Early years[edit]
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York.[3] He attended the University at Buffalo.[4] After college and marriage to the former Revé Drew in 1971, the newlywed Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.
Murder of Adam Walsh[edit]
Main article: Murder of Adam Walsh
In the summer of 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas,[5] and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall, across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam's case released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store.[6] Adam has been thought to be one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal 120 miles (190 km) away from home. His other remains were never recovered.[7]
Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case in the nearly three decades since the murder, but that of serial killer Ottis Toole most persistently nagged detectives. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole's home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an America's Most Wanted statement on February 6, 2007.[8]
The prime suspect in Adam's abduction and murder, Toole, who died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes, was officially identified as the killer on December 16, 2008 by the Hollywood Police Department, and the case was considered closed.[9] Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.
Aftermath[edit]
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform.[10] The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.
The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John's and Revé's efforts eventually led to the creation of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984.
Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims' rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims' rights.
The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Pub.L. 109–248) was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress and was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for not registering as a sex offender following release into society, and access by citizens to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong Scarlet Letter, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.

A "Code Adam" is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. "Code Adam" as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an "Amber Alert," which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.

The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing.

Early years[edit]
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York.[3] He attended the University at Buffalo.[4] After college and marriage to the former Revé Drew in 1971, the newlywed Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.
Murder of Adam Walsh[edit]
Main article: Murder of Adam Walsh
In the summer of 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas,[5] and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall, across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam's case released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store.[6] Adam has been thought to be one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal 120 miles (190 km) away from home. His other remains were never recovered.[7]
Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case in the nearly three decades since the murder, but that of serial killer Ottis Toole most persistently nagged detectives. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole's home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an America's Most Wanted statement on February 6, 2007.[8]
The prime suspect in Adam's abduction and murder, Toole, who died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes, was officially identified as the killer on December 16, 2008 by the Hollywood Police Department, and the case was considered closed.[9] Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.
Aftermath[edit]
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform.[10] The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.
The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John's and Revé's efforts eventually led to the creation of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984.
Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims' rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims' rights.
The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Pub.L. 109–248) was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress and was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for not registering as a sex offender following release into society, and access by citizens to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong Scarlet Letter, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.
By the late 1980s, many malls, department stores, supermarkets, and other such retailers have adopted what is known as a "Code Adam," a movement first started by Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. A "Code Adam" is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. "Code Adam" as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an "Amber Alert," which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.
Career in television[edit]
John and Revé Walsh were portrayed by actors Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams in Adam, a 1983 NBC television film dramatizing the days following Adam's disappearance. The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing. Later, a sequel called Adam: His Song Continues was produced and aired.




John Walsh presents a fugitive on America's Most Wanted


After securing a deal with Fox, Walsh launched America's Most Wanted in 1988. By that time, Walsh was already well known because of the murder of his son and his subsequent actions to help missing and exploited children. America's Most Wanted was the longest-running crime reality show in Fox's history and had contributed to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives. Fox canceled the series in June 2011, but aired four specials during the 2011-12 season. On December 2, 2011, the series returned as a regular weekly first-run series on Lifetime. The last episode aired on October 12, 2012; five months later, in March 2013, Lifetime officially canceled the series.
Walsh also hosted his own daytime talk show, The John Walsh Show, which aired in syndication (mostly on NBC-owned and affiliated stations, as NBC produced the series) from 2002 to 2004.[11]
In July 2005, Walsh attempted to assist the family of missing teen Natalee Holloway. Walsh was critical of the Aruban crime investigation and, along with television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, urged Americans to boycott Aruba. Walsh was a special guest on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired on August 14, 2005. The episode visited the home of Colleen Nick, who is the parent of Morgan Nick, a six-year-old girl who has been missing since 1995. Walsh has featured the Morgan Nick case on America's Most Wanted several times.
His life story was featured on The E! True Hollywood Story and Biography.
Walsh is now the host of The Hunt with John Walsh. The program, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN/US, is similar to America's Most Wanted.[12]
Family[edit]
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (born 1982), Callahan (born 1987), and Hayden (born 1994).
Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that "there is no substitute for Adam." She also said "Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister." Meghan is currently a singer, fashion designer and resides in Vero Beach with her daughter Eva.[13]
Hayden sometimes accompanies his father when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On the show of July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, Larry King said that Hayden resembled Adam.[13]
Tributes[edit]
In 2002, rapper Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony wrote a song for the show (AMW) and dedicated it to Adam and John Walsh, encouraging abduction survivors not to keep their abductions a secret, as Bizzy Bone did after being abducted in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
On August 15, 2006, John Walsh's hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.[14]
In 2005, John Walsh appeared as himself in Outsiders #18 (January 2005), a comic book series published by DC Comics[citation needed]. In the story, written by Judd Winick, Walsh aided the eponymous superhero team in going public on America's Most Wanted with information regarding a child slave trader, which eventually led to a solid lead gained from the tips that poured in.
For a few years in the early 1990s, due to his presence on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with reminder to call 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.[citation needed]
In October 2008, John Walsh was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.[15] for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.[16]
Controversy[edit]
John Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he jokingly told senators to implant "exploding" chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, "I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message." Walsh stated this was a "joke," but that "nobody thought it was funny."[17] Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.[18]
John Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. "It's not a witch hunt," he said. "It's all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who's more likely to molest a child? A male."[19]
In his book Tears of Rage, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York.[20] Critics of Adam Walsh Act have pointed out that, had he been convicted, Walsh himself would be subject to sex offender registration under the law which he aggressively promoted.
Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic by using his publicity.[21] Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is "littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children",[22] when in fact, later Department of Justice study from 1999 found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, of which about 50 resulted in death or child not being found.[23] Critics claim that Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated 1.5 million dollars annually following his testimony before the Congress.[22]

Later, a sequel called Adam: His Song Continues was produced and aired.




John Walsh presents a fugitive on America's Most Wanted


After securing a deal with Fox, Walsh launched America's Most Wanted in 1988. By that time, Walsh was already well known because of the murder of his son and his subsequent actions to help missing and exploited children. America's Most Wanted was the longest-running crime reality show in Fox's history and had contributed to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives. Fox canceled the series in June 2011, but aired four specials during the 2011-12 season. On December 2, 2011, the series returned as a regular weekly first-run series on Lifetime. The last episode aired on October 12, 2012; five months later, in March 2013, Lifetime officially canceled the series.
Walsh also hosted his own daytime talk show, The John Walsh Show, which aired in syndication (mostly on NBC-owned and affiliated stations, as NBC produced the series) from 2002 to 2004.[11]
In July 2005, Walsh attempted to assist the family of missing teen Natalee Holloway. Walsh was critical of the Aruban crime investigation and, along with television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, urged Americans to boycott Aruba. Walsh was a special guest on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired on August 14, 2005. The episode visited the home of Colleen Nick, who is the parent of Morgan Nick, a six-year-old girl who has been missing since 1995. Walsh has featured the Morgan Nick case on America's Most Wanted several times.
His life story was featured on The E! True Hollywood Story and Biography.
Walsh is now the host of The Hunt with John Walsh. The program, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN/US, is similar to America's Most Wanted.[12]
Family[edit]
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (born 1982), Callahan (born 1987), and Hayden (born 1994).
Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that "there is no substitute for Adam." She also said "Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister." Meghan is currently a singer, fashion designer and resides in Vero Beach with her daughter Eva.[13]
Hayden sometimes accompanies his father when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On the show of July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, Larry King said that Hayden resembled Adam.[13]
Tributes[edit]
In 2002, rapper Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony wrote a song for the show (AMW) and dedicated it to Adam and John Walsh, encouraging abduction survivors not to keep their abductions a secret, as Bizzy Bone did after being abducted in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
On August 15, 2006, John Walsh's hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.[14]
In 2005, John Walsh appeared as himself in Outsiders #18 (January 2005), a comic book series published by DC Comics[citation needed]. In the story, written by Judd Winick, Walsh aided the eponymous superhero team in going public on America's Most Wanted with information regarding a child slave trader, which eventually led to a solid lead gained from the tips that poured in.
For a few years in the early 1990s, due to his presence on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with reminder to call 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.[citation needed]
In October 2008, John Walsh was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.[15] for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.[16]
Controversy[edit]
John Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he jokingly told senators to implant "exploding" chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, "I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message." Walsh stated this was a "joke," but that "nobody thought it was funny."[17] Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.[18]
John Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. "It's not a witch hunt," he said. "It's all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who's more likely to molest a child? A male."[19]
In his book Tears of Rage, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York.[20] Critics of Adam Walsh Act have pointed out that, had he been convicted, Walsh himself would be subject to sex offender registration under the law which he aggressively promoted.
Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic by using his publicity.[21] Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is "littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children",[22] when in fact, later Department of Justice study from 1999 found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, of which about 50 resulted in death or child not being found.[23] Critics claim that Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated 1.5 million dollars annually following his testimony before the Congress.[22]

Early years[edit]
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York.[3] He attended the University at Buffalo.[4] After college and marriage to the former Revé Drew in 1971, the newlywed Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.
Murder of Adam Walsh[edit]
Main article: Murder of Adam Walsh
In the summer of 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas,[5] and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall, across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam's case released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store.[6] Adam has been thought to be one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal 120 miles (190 km) away from home. His other remains were never recovered.[7]
Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case in the nearly three decades since the murder, but that of serial killer Ottis Toole most persistently nagged detectives. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole's home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an America's Most Wanted statement on February 6, 2007.[8]
The prime suspect in Adam's abduction and murder, Toole, who died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes, was officially identified as the killer on December 16, 2008 by the Hollywood Police Department, and the case was considered closed.[9] Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.
Aftermath[edit]
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform.[10] The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.
The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John's and Revé's efforts eventually led to the creation of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984.
Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims' rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims' rights.
The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Pub.L. 109–248) was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress and was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for not registering as a sex offender following release into society, and access by citizens to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong Scarlet Letter, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.
By the late 1980s, many malls, department stores, supermarkets, and other such retailers have adopted what is known as a "Code Adam," a movement first started by Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. A "Code Adam" is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. "Code Adam" as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an "Amber Alert," which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.
Career in television[edit]
John and Revé Walsh were portrayed by actors Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams in Adam, a 1983 NBC television film dramatizing the days following Adam's disappearance. The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing. Later, a sequel called Adam: His Song Continues was produced and aired.

Early years[edit]
Walsh was born in Auburn, New York.[3] He attended the University at Buffalo.[4] After college and marriage to the former Revé Drew in 1971, the newlywed Walshes settled in South Florida, where John became involved in building high-end luxury hotels.
Murder of Adam Walsh[edit]
Main article: Murder of Adam Walsh
In the summer of 1981, Walsh was an official with Paradise Island Hotel and Casino in The Bahamas,[5] and worked in Hollywood, Florida. He and his wife, Revé, had a six-year-old son, Adam. On July 27, 1981, Adam was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall, across from the Hollywood Police station. Revé had left Adam in the toy department at a model video game console at the Sears while she looked for a lamp. When she returned several minutes later, Adam was missing. Police records in Adam's case released in 1996, show that a 17-year-old security guard instructed four boys to leave the department store.[6] Adam has been thought to be one of them. Sixteen days after the abduction, his severed head was found in a drainage canal 120 miles (190 km) away from home. His other remains were never recovered.[7]
Many names had been mentioned in connection to the case in the nearly three decades since the murder, but that of serial killer Ottis Toole most persistently nagged detectives. John Walsh had long said he believed that Toole, a drifter, was responsible for the crime, saying investigators found a pair of green shorts and a sandal similar to what Adam was wearing at Toole's home in Jacksonville, Florida. In January 2007, deceased serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer fell under suspicion for the murder of Adam. This speculation was discounted by Walsh in an America's Most Wanted statement on February 6, 2007.[8]
The prime suspect in Adam's abduction and murder, Toole, who died in prison in 1996 while serving a life sentence for other crimes, was officially identified as the killer on December 16, 2008 by the Hollywood Police Department, and the case was considered closed.[9] Over the years, Toole had twice confessed to the killing, but both times he later recanted his admissions. In addition to the Walsh murder, Toole had claimed responsibility for hundreds of other murders, but police determined that most of these confessions were lies.
Aftermath[edit]
Following the crime, the Walsh family founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to legislative reform.[10] The centers, originally located in West Palm Beach, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Orange County, California; and Rochester, New York; merged with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), where John Walsh serves on the board of directors.
The Walsh family organized a political campaign to help missing and exploited children. Despite bureaucratic and legislative problems, John's and Revé's efforts eventually led to the creation of the Missing Children Act of 1982 and the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984.
Today, Walsh continues to testify before Congress and state legislatures on crime, missing children and victims' rights issues. His latest efforts include lobbying for a Constitutional amendment for victims' rights.
The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Pub.L. 109–248) was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006, following a two-year journey through the United States Congress and was intensely lobbied for by Walsh and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Primarily, it focuses on a national sex offender registry, tough penalties for not registering as a sex offender following release into society, and access by citizens to state websites that track sex offenders. Critics argue that the system amounts to making offenders wear a lifelong Scarlet Letter, regardless of the circumstances of their cases.
By the late 1980s, many malls, department stores, supermarkets, and other such retailers have adopted what is known as a "Code Adam," a movement first started by Walmart stores in the southeastern United States. A "Code Adam" is announced when a child is missing in a store or if a child is found by a store employee or customer. If the child is lost or missing, all doors will be locked and a store employee is posted at every exit, while a description of the child is generally broadcast over the intercom system. "Code Adam" as a term has become synonymous with a missing child, and is a predecessor to an "Amber Alert," which serves as a system of broadcast-driven community notification.
Career in television[edit]
John and Revé Walsh were portrayed by actors Daniel J. Travanti and JoBeth Williams in Adam, a 1983 NBC television film dramatizing the days following Adam's disappearance. The real Walshes appeared at the end of the broadcast to publicize photographs of other children who had vanished but were still missing. Later, a sequel called Adam: His Song Continues was produced and aired.




John Walsh presents a fugitive on America's Most Wanted


After securing a deal with Fox, Walsh launched America's Most Wanted in 1988. By that time, Walsh was already well known because of the murder of his son and his subsequent actions to help missing and exploited children. America's Most Wanted was the longest-running crime reality show in Fox's history and had contributed to the capture of more than 1,000 fugitives. Fox canceled the series in June 2011, but aired four specials during the 2011-12 season. On December 2, 2011, the series returned as a regular weekly first-run series on Lifetime. The last episode aired on October 12, 2012; five months later, in March 2013, Lifetime officially canceled the series.
Walsh also hosted his own daytime talk show, The John Walsh Show, which aired in syndication (mostly on NBC-owned and affiliated stations, as NBC produced the series) from 2002 to 2004.[11]
In July 2005, Walsh attempted to assist the family of missing teen Natalee Holloway. Walsh was critical of the Aruban crime investigation and, along with television personality Dr. Phil McGraw, urged Americans to boycott Aruba. Walsh was a special guest on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition that aired on August 14, 2005. The episode visited the home of Colleen Nick, who is the parent of Morgan Nick, a six-year-old girl who has been missing since 1995. Walsh has featured the Morgan Nick case on America's Most Wanted several times.
His life story was featured on The E! True Hollywood Story and Biography.
Walsh is now the host of The Hunt with John Walsh. The program, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN/US, is similar to America's Most Wanted.[12]
Family[edit]
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (born 1982), Callahan (born 1987), and Hayden (born 1994).
Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that "there is no substitute for Adam." She also said "Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister." Meghan is currently a singer, fashion designer and resides in Vero Beach with her daughter Eva.[13]
Hayden sometimes accompanies his father when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On the show of July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, Larry King said that Hayden resembled Adam.[13]
Tributes[edit]
In 2002, rapper Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony wrote a song for the show (AMW) and dedicated it to Adam and John Walsh, encouraging abduction survivors not to keep their abductions a secret, as Bizzy Bone did after being abducted in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
On August 15, 2006, John Walsh's hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.[14]
In 2005, John Walsh appeared as himself in Outsiders #18 (January 2005), a comic book series published by DC Comics[citation needed]. In the story, written by Judd Winick, Walsh aided the eponymous superhero team in going public on America's Most Wanted with information regarding a child slave trader, which eventually led to a solid lead gained from the tips that poured in.
For a few years in the early 1990s, due to his presence on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with reminder to call 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.[citation needed]
In October 2008, John Walsh was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.[15] for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.[16]
Controversy[edit]
John Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he jokingly told senators to implant "exploding" chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, "I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message." Walsh stated this was a "joke," but that "nobody thought it was funny."[17] Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.[18]
John Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. "It's not a witch hunt," he said. "It's all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who's more likely to molest a child? A male."[19]
In his book Tears of Rage, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York.[20] Critics of Adam Walsh Act have pointed out that, had he been convicted, Walsh himself would be subject to sex offender registration under the law which he aggressively promoted.
Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic by using his publicity.[21] Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is "littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children",[22] when in fact, later Department of Justice study from 1999 found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, of which about 50 resulted in death or child not being found.[23] Critics claim that Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated 1.5 million dollars annually following his testimony before the Congress.[22]

Then one night Tom Roche was sitting around in my place and picked up a copy of that day’s Buffalo Evening News. It was a picture of Reve, who had just won an art contest. ‘Holy Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,’ Tom said. ‘There is a picture of Reve in the paper, John, and she's 16 years old.’ But you know, she had this way about her. She had a certain presence. And after awhile I just got over how young she was. She was way more sophisticated than anybody in her high school and she always dated older guys. She had a fake ID.

Walsh is now the host of The Hunt with John Walsh. The program, which debuted on July 13, 2014 on CNN/US, is similar to America's Most Wanted.[12]
Family[edit]
After the murder of Adam, the Walshes had three more children: Meghan (born 1982), Callahan (born 1987), and Hayden (born 1994).
Meghan was born a year after Adam was murdered. Revé Walsh told local newspapers at the time that "there is no substitute for Adam." She also said "Meghan will make me miss Adam more. He always wanted a sister." Meghan is currently a singer, fashion designer and resides in Vero Beach with her daughter Eva.[13]
Hayden sometimes accompanies his father when filming TV shows, including America's Most Wanted. On the show of July 27, 2006 of Larry King Live, Larry King said that Hayden resembled Adam.[13]
Tributes[edit]
In 2002, rapper Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony wrote a song for the show (AMW) and dedicated it to Adam and John Walsh, encouraging abduction survivors not to keep their abductions a secret, as Bizzy Bone did after being abducted in the early 1980s.[citation needed]
On August 15, 2006, John Walsh's hometown of Auburn, New York, named a street after him.[14]
In 2005, John Walsh appeared as himself in Outsiders #18 (January 2005), a comic book series published by DC Comics[citation needed]. In the story, written by Judd Winick, Walsh aided the eponymous superhero team in going public on America's Most Wanted with information regarding a child slave trader, which eventually led to a solid lead gained from the tips that poured in.
For a few years in the early 1990s, due to his presence on Fox, Walsh also appeared in the network's Saturday morning educational public service announcement segments, Totally For Kids, for Fox Kids. Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek. Subjects ranged from child abuse to being lost in a public place, whereas others were milder in nature such as never inviting strangers indoors if home alone or the problems of sugar rushes. Most installments Walsh appeared in culminated with reminder to call 911 in an emergency, showing a child dressed up in a telephone costume.[citation needed]
In October 2008, John Walsh was awarded the Operation Kids 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.[15] for his dedication to protecting children and to raise funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which Walsh co-founded with his wife.[16]
Controversy[edit]
John Walsh generated a great deal of controversy during a summer press tour in 2006 when he stated to the media he jokingly told senators to implant "exploding" chips in the anuses of sex offenders. He stated, "I said implant it in their anus and if they go outside the radius, explode it, that would send a big message." Walsh stated this was a "joke," but that "nobody thought it was funny."[17] Walsh later suggested implanting GPS chips in such criminals.[18]
John Walsh also faced criticism when he advised women to never hire a male babysitter, which was seen as a blatantly sexist remark. "It's not a witch hunt," he said. "It's all about minimizing risks. What dog is more likely to bite and hurt you? A Doberman, not a poodle. Who's more likely to molest a child? A male."[19]
In his book Tears of Rage, Walsh openly admits being in a relationship with 16-year-old Revé when Walsh was in his early 20s and aware of the age of consent being 17 in New York.[20] Critics of Adam Walsh Act have pointed out that, had he been convicted, Walsh himself would be subject to sex offender registration under the law which he aggressively promoted.
Some critics accuse Walsh of creating predator panic by using his publicity.[21] Walsh was heard by Congress on February 2, 1983, where he gave an unsourced claim of 50,000 abducted and 1.5 million missing children annually. He testified that the U.S. is "littered with mutilated, decapitated, raped, strangled children",[22] when in fact, later Department of Justice study from 1999 found only 115 incidences of stereotypical kidnappings perpetrated by strangers, of which about 50 resulted in death or child not being found.[23] Critics claim that Adam Walsh Child Resource Center, which started without funding in 1981, generated 1.5 million dollars annually following his testimony before the Congress.[22]

I never gave much thought to how old Reve was. She was pretty, and she dressed sharp. And there was also that body. We were starting to kind of hang around together. She took me horseback riding, and we went skiing. She was always into her own thing, and I like that. Then one night Tom Roche was sitting around in my place and picked up a copy of that day’s Buffalo Evening News. It was a picture of Reve, who had just won an art contest. ‘Holy Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,’ Tom said. ‘There is a picture of Reve in the paper, John, and she's 16 years old.’ But you know, she had this way about her. She had a certain presence. And after awhile I just got over how young she was. She was way more sophisticated than anybody in her high school and she always dated older guys. She had a fake ID. That's how she got into Brunner’s. She was born with high school. She was into art and her horses. And even then, she always seemed very… I don't know, serene. We weren't madly in love with each other. Though we had a good time together, and I relaxed a little after she turned 17."

The crime TV host recently shared bizarre police procedure related to his son Adam's 1981 abduction and murder

This story first appeared in the Dec. 19 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
Crime TV host John Walsh (The Hunt, America's Most Wanted) long has spoken of his son Adam's 1981 abduction and murder. But during a Soho House New York panel hosted by Starz on Nov. 19 — timed to the airing of The Missing, about a kidnapping — he shared a wrenching detail for the first time.
"People don't know this, but [police] kept Adam's severed head in the morgue for 27 years, saying you can't bury your child because it's an open capital murder," said Walsh. "We could never get Adam's remains while the case was botched."
Law enforcement closed the case in 2008 after declaring deceased drifter Ottis Toole was the killer.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]
Notable people[edit]

Annaleise Carr, the youngest person to swim across Lake Ontario
Egerton Ryerson, Methodist minister, educator, politician, and public education advocate in early Ontario history
Joseph Ryerson, soldier, United Empire Loyalist and father of Egerton
David Tisdale, Canadian politician
Aquila Walsh, Canadian civil engineer, politician, and civil servant
William L. Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]
Notable people[edit]

Annaleise Carr, the youngest person to swim across Lake Ontario
Egerton Ryerson, Methodist minister, educator, politician, and public education advocate in early Ontario history
Joseph Ryerson, soldier, United Empire Loyalist and father of Egerton
David Tisdale, Canadian politician
Aquila Walsh, Canadian civil engineer, politician, and civil servant
William L. Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]
Notable people[edit]

Annaleise Carr, the youngest person to swim across Lake Ontario
Egerton Ryerson, Methodist minister, educator, politician, and public education advocate in early Ontario history
Joseph Ryerson, soldier, United Empire Loyalist and father of Egerton
David Tisdale, Canadian politician
Aquila Walsh, Canadian civil engineer, politician, and civil servant
William L. Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]
Notable people[edit]

Annaleise Carr, the youngest person to swim across Lake Ontario
Egerton Ryerson, Methodist minister, educator, politician, and public education advocate in early Ontario history
Joseph Ryerson, soldier, United Empire Loyalist and father of Egerton
David Tisdale, Canadian politician
Aquila Walsh, Canadian civil engineer, politician, and civil servant
William L. Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.

Summary[edit]




This is the Walsh General Store, owned and operated by Mr. Colwell, as seen in the 1950s.


Walsh developed as a township central crossroads gathering point on Young's Creek, in the first quarter of the 19th century. A number of service businesses have come and gone over the years, as road quality improved and practical travel distances increased. No commercial business remain, although Walsh is home to two elementary schools, two Christian churches, the township community hall that hosts an annual fall fair and the operating headquarters of a major regional transportation company.
Walsh is located near streams, valleys, conservation areas, and bays.[2] Notable attractions within a reasonable driving distance of Walsh include the Norfolk County Fair and Horse Show, Turkey Point Beach, Lake Erie, and various rural cemeteries.[2] During the fall months, pumpkins become abundant in the area - especially the rare "dwarf albino" pumpkin.[2] Robins can be seen strutting through the local gardens for all 12 months of the year.[2] Maurice Danko Jr., the brother of the late musician Rick Danko, was last seen residing in the Walsh area.[3] Along the Turkey Point Road, tobacco kilns can be seen in threesomes.[2] During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a wholesaler was once stationed here. It had become a private residence by the early 1990s.
A local businessman by the name of Bruce R. Smith starting hauling dairy products out of his trucking business in Walsh starting back in 1947.[4] His son, John, took over the business in the mid-1970s and expanded the business and slowly recruited the help of 230 power units and 750 semi-trailer trucks delivering goods throughout Quebec, Ontario, and the United States over the decades.[4] Food products in addition to steel from the Stelco Lake Erie Works greenfield steel mill are delivered with the help of global positioning systems and a computerized dispatch system that allows for networking over a wide area.[4] As of 2012, there are 350 rank-and-file employees in addition to 210 professional operators and 50 operators that own their own vehicles.[4]
Most people get their television either through Shaw Direct, Bell TV or over-the-air. Two channels can be picked up reliably using an outdoor antenna while an additional three channels can be picked up semi-reliably. There are at least 12 channels that can be picked up over-the-air only during sunny days where clouds are absent.[5]
Education[edit]
This community is home to two elementary schools: Walsh Public School (within the Grand Erie District School Board) and St. Michael’s Catholic Elementary School (administered by the Brant Haldimand Norfolk Catholic District School Board).[6] During the peak of local population growth in the mid-19th century, 14 one-room and two-room schools were functioning within the Township of Charletteville.
Walsh Area Public School was constructed in 1959 on an open-field site along the north side of St. John's Road, between the Turkey Point Road and Young's Creek. It opened in March 1960, a four-room school that culminated a five-year consolidation effort that merged four one- and two-room elementary schools within five miles of the village: Walsh, Tisdale, Elmwood and McKnight.[7] The guest of honour at the official opening in September 1960 was Education Minister and future Premier John Robarts. Expansion of the public school came in three phases over the next 15 years to achieve its current configuration. It also had its name shortened to Walsh Public School.
The children of Walsh Public School were involved in an attempt to break the Guinness Book of Records for reading on January 26, 2009.[8] A relaxation room (dubbed the Snoezelen Room from the Dutch words snufflen - to seek out - and doezelen - to snooze) has been installed on the premises to relax hyperactive children in addition to children on the autistic spectrum who unintentionally disrupt their classes. They often return to their classroom after a few minutes of relaxation in this sensation-filled room without having to visit the principal for disciplinary measures. Soft music is constantly played in the room while children with special needs can either touch or hear calming sensations.[9] In September 2013, Walsh Public School started to provide an all-day kindergarten program.[10]
The Grand Erie Board administers four secondary schools to which Walsh graduates can advance: Simcoe Composite School, Port Dover Composite School, Delhi District Secondary School and Valley Heights Secondary School.
St. Michael's Elementary School was launched in the early 1950s, initially in the basement of St. Michael's Catholic Church next door. The current school was opened in January 1961 as a two-room school and subsequently has been expanded to the present structure. Graduates can advance preferentially to Holy Trinity Catholic High School in Simcoe.
A local bursary; known as the Charlotteville Bursary has been traditionally awarded for secondary school graduates from the Walsh area as an incentive to attend either the college or university of their choice.
Nearest communities[edit]
Walsh is located near these major communities: Simcoe - 14 kilometres (8.7 mi), Delhi - 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), Port Dover - 18 kilometres (11 mi), Tillsonburg - 35 kilometres (22 mi), Brantford - 56 kilometres (35 mi) and Woodstock - 60 kilometres (37 mi).
Mount Forest is located 54.8 kilometres or 34.1 miles to the north of this community.[2] It is an unincorporated community located on the junction of Ontario Highways 6 and 89 in the township of Wellington North.
Places of worship[edit]
The first Christian community established in Walsh was the Charlotteville Methodist Church, constructed in 1856 and located 1.3 kilometres to the south. That community thrived through the 1925 merger that created the United Church of Canada and beyond, but suffered badly from declining membership during the Great Depression and it ceased operation in the early 1940s. After being vacant for nearly 20 years, the building was demolished in 1962. A commemorative monument remains, in the northeast corner of the cemetery.
Two churches in the area continue to provide the spiritual and religious needs of the local residents: Walsh Baptist Church and St. Michael's Roman Catholic Church.
Walsh Baptist Church was established in 1876 and has served a thriving community of worshippers since that time. During the first few decades of the 20th century a close collaboration developed with the Charlotteville Methodist Church.[7] When the United Church dissolved early during the Second World War, their remaining members were welcomed into the Baptist community. The Baptist church annex including Sunday school classrooms, church hall, kitchen and washrooms was constructed during the winter of 1961-62. The Baptist cemetery is situated on a sheltered hilltop on the east side of the Turkey Point Road, 400 metres or 1,300 feet north of the main intersection. The Walsh Baptist Church is led by Pastor Marc Bertrand; who has served the region since 2003.[11][12]
St. Michael's Catholic Church was established in 1947.[7] Although it functioned as a mission church of St. Cecilia's Parish in Port Dover in earlier years, St. Michael's is now under the care of the Sacred Heart Parish in Langton.[7]
Another church that survived for about 35 years was the independent Faith Baptist Church, which officially broke away from congregation of the regular Baptist church in 1926. Located in a white frame building on the southeast corner of the main intersection, dwindling membership eventually forced the church to cease operations in the early 1960s. After several years of commercial usage, the building was demolished.
History[edit]
Pre-20th century[edit]
The Walsh area’s earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois 300 years later. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.
The first Caucasian settlers in Charlotteville were the United Empire Loyalist settlers from just prior to the year 1800. Charlotteville was named after Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, the ruling monarch at the time. Charlotteville, roughly 100 square miles was surveyed by the Walsh/Welch family, with the work completed by 1805. The township was laid out, nine miles wide, back from the nominal shoreline of Lake Erie. On a 180-chain spacing (about four kilometres) between the two town lines roads were the two quarter line roads and the centre line road, now known as the Turkey Point road, running northwards, from Turkey Point, through Charlotteville Centre and beyond. Perpendicular to the line roads was a series of twelve concession roads, spaced 70 chains apart (about 1.5 kilometres), from the Lake Erie shore, back to the north boundary. The Township of Charlotteville became an incorporated municipality within the County of Norfolk, in 1850.
Because of its convenient central location, Charlotteville Centre, now known as Walsh, was designated the administrative centre. The Township Hall building, constructed at a cost of $700 in 1868 still stands. In later years, the township seat administrative function was relocated to the larger village of Vittoria, four miles to the southeast. Walsh developed as a community centre and gathering place during the first half of the nineteenth century after Charlotteville Township was surveyed. Located at the intersection of the middle of five north-south "line roads" and the sixth of twelve west-east concession roads made it a logical central focus point for the growing township.
Railway service once provided freight and passenger service at a railway junction, three concessions to the south, known as Walsh Station (42°43′55″N 80°21′46″W﻿ / ﻿42.732072°N 80.362844°W﻿ / 42.732072; -80.362844﻿ (Walsh Station, Ontario)) from its inception in 1886 by the South Norfolk Railway until all service was terminated in 1962 by the Canadian National Railways. Canadian National removed the railway tracks three years later in 1965.
The proximity to Young's Creek with a water flow to power flour and lumber mills was an added advantage favouring the location. From a geographical perspective, Young's Creek originates about four kilometers northwest of the village and passes through Walsh, and then Vittoria, before discharging into Lake Erie, 11 kilometres or 6.8 miles away in Port Ryerse.[13] This creek would eventually provide water to nearby Vitorria in addition to Greens Corners, Port Ryerse, Normandale, Turkey Point, St. Williams and Port Rowan.[14]
20th century[edit]
With the escalation of gasoline consumption after the Great Depression, the number of low volume rural gasoline retailers peaked in the late 1950s. Gas prices reached 5.5 cents a litre by 1959 due to the low fuel taxes and surplus of oil from the Middle East during that era.[15] At that time, Walsh had three such businesses. Colwell, General Merchant, described more fully below, was located on the northwest corner of the main intersection and sold Supertest products. Facing them, across the road, on the northeast corner was another general store, Earle's Grocery, that sold Reliance products. Ironically, Supertest and Reliance were of the same corporate ownership but operated as separate companies. Half a block to the south of Earle's was the village's only full scope service station, Engell's Walsh Garage that sold Texaco products. At Walsh Station located five kilometers to the south, Cherwaty's Service sold Fina products[16] during the early years of his business. He would keep the business selling Petro-Canada products before passing away in 2008 at the Leisure World in Brantford.[17]
Unfortunately, the local gasoline retailers have all gone out of business.[16] The gas station at the general store belonging to the parents of local petroliana collector Alex Colwell handled Supertest products for oil and automobile gasoline.[16] Supertest was an all-Canadian company that operated until being bought out by BP Canada in the 1970s (which was bought out by Petro-Canada in 1983).[18]
Natural gas production is found throughout the Walsh area; this production spreads as fast east as Vittoria and as far west as Jericho and Silver Hill.[19] More than 40,000 acres or 1.7×109 square feet of petroleum and mineral leases are within the boundaries of Walsh along with the nearby communities of Walsingham and Houghton. Approximately 85 businesses and residences are served by this company through a special agreement with Union Gas.[20]
In 2001, Haldimand-Norfolk was dissolved into two separate single-tier counties. Walsh became part of the newly formed County of Norfolk.
Donnybrook Fair[edit]
An annual fair held in the hamlet called the Donnybrook Fair attracts kids and adults from the area in the middle of September.[21]
It has been held since 1857, with the fair growing in size and quality every year. Children who attend school within the immediate vicinity are allowed to enter any artwork that they produced themselves in addition to their own crafts and agriculture-related artifacts. They are typically between the ages of 5 and 13. Homeschooled children may also enter the contests. In the 2011 edition of the Donnybrook Fair, these local students have managed to win $1346 in tax-free cash. This monetary award encourages children to save up for higher education opportunities. The short-term effects of the award system encourages children to work on their innovative spirit and improve their work ethics. Although the winner of the Donnybrook Fair demolition derby is no longer assured a spot in the Norfolk County Fair version of the event, the prize money keeps increasing and the event is done over a traditional dirt track. Fundraising for the Donnybrook Fair involves a Victoria Day brunch, an annual spring barbecue, and numerous raffles.[21]
Notable people[edit]

Annaleise Carr, the youngest person to swim across Lake Ontario
Egerton Ryerson, Methodist minister, educator, politician, and public education advocate in early Ontario history
Joseph Ryerson, soldier, United Empire Loyalist and father of Egerton
David Tisdale, Canadian politician
Aquila Walsh, Canadian civil engineer, politician, and civil servant
William L. Walsh, Canadian lawyer and judge

Climate[edit]
Walsh traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone; even with the recent epidemic of mild winters and extremely warm and dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Walsh throughout the decades.
The warmest summers that Walsh has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July[22]), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.[23]
Should the sea levels rise by 60 metres or 200 feet, Walsh is not located close enough to salt water to be affected directly by flooding.[24] However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources and would have to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from hundreds of miles away. Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources hundreds of miles away like Los Angeles; which is located in the middle of a desert.
