Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.

Exchange-Traded Funds

                Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in worldwide markets. ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day. ETFs combine the characteristics of a mutual fund with the convenience and trading flexibility of stocks. ETFs offer investors the potential advantages of low operating costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.

 Implications:  Existing home sales took a breather in June, giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month.  Sales of previously-owned homes fell 1.8% in June to a 5.52 million annual rate, but are still up 0.7% from a year ago.  Going forward, it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month, but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going.  That being said, tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds.  Inventories have now fallen on a year-over-year basis for 25 consecutive months and are down 7.1% from a year ago.  Inventories are now the lowest for any June since at least the late 1990s.  This has also affected the months' supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was 4.3 months in June, down from 4.6 months a year ago.  According to the NAR, anything less than 5.0 months is considered tight supply, a benchmark which hasn't been exceeded since November 2015.  The good news is that demand for existing homes in June was so strong that 54% of listings were on the market for less than a month.  Higher demand and a shift in the "mix" of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices, which have now risen for 64 consecutive months on a year-over-year basis, and reached a new record high in June.  The strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes, signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market.  Tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing, tilting development toward higher-end homes.  The NAR suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices.  Although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, it's important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards, incomes are growing, and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again.

   Moderate Growth for Q2






Since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1%.  The second quarter of this year doesn't look much different.  Our calculations suggest real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in Q2, exactly the same as the consensus forecast.
That's an acceleration from the 1.4% pace in Q1 and we expect better growth ahead. But consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from Washington, DC.  Instead, it's going to take some concrete steps, like less regulation, lower tax rates, less spending, and a more free-market approach to health care.        
Here's how we get to 2.5% for Q2.
Consumption:  Automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a 12.3% annual rate in Q2.  "Real" (inflation-adjusted) retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a 1.2% rate, but growth in services was strong, in part due to a rebound in (seasonally-adjusted) utility output after unusually mild weather in January and February.  Our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services, combined, grew at a 2.9% annual rate in Q2, contributing 2.0 points to the real GDP growth rate (2.9 times the consumption share of GDP, which is 69%, equals 2.0).
Business Investment:  After clicking on all cylinders in Q1, business investment grew more modestly in Q2.  Investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a 4% rate, but commercial construction fell at about a 7% pace.  Combined, it looks like they grew at a 1.7% rate, which should add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth.  (1.7 times the 13% business investment share of GDP equals 0.2).
Home Building:  While boosting utilities in Q2, the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction.  Home building looks like it grew in Q2, but at a 2.5% annualized pace rather than the 12.9% pace in Q1.  The trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise, as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing.  In the meantime, a 2.5% growth rate will add 0.1 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (2.5 times the home building share of GDP, which is 4%, equals 0.1).
Government:  Both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in Q2.  On net, we're estimating that real government purchases were up at a 1.4% annual rate in Q2, which would add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (1.4 times the government purchase share of GDP, which is 17%, equals 0.2).
Trade:  At this point, we only have trade data through May.  Based on what we've seen so far, it looks like net exports should subtract 0.3 points from the real GDP growth rate in Q2.   
Inventories:  We have even less information on inventories than we do on trade, but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than they were in Q1, which should add 0.3 points to the real GDP growth rate.
Keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the GDP release and those figures could change our forecast as well.  But, for the time being, you can put it all together, and get an estimate of 2.5% for Q2.  
No one should be excited or dismayed by this report.  It is the epitome of the Plow Horse pace of growth we've had for the past eight years.   Hopefully, Washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last Plow Horse reports we have to see.

   Housing Starts Increased 8.3% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Starts • Housing


 Implications:  After falling for three consecutive months, housing starts rebounded strongly in June, beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year.  Even though both single-family and multi-unit starts were responsible for the gain in June's headline number, in the past year single-family starts are up 10.3% while multi-unit starts are down 12.9%.  The "mix" of construction has been generally shifting toward single-family building and this is a good sign for the overall economy.  When the housing recovery started, multi-family construction led the way. But the share of all housing starts that are multi-family appears to have peaked in 2015, when 35.7% of all starts were multi-family, the largest since the mid-1980s, when the last wave of Baby Boomers was growing up and moving to cities. In June, the multi-family share of starts was 30.1%.  The shift toward single-family is a positive sign for the economy because, on average, each single-family home contributes to GDP about twice the amount of a multi-family unit.  Based on population growth and "scrappage," housing starts should eventually rise to about 1.5 million units per year. In other words, much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us.  Another bright spot in today's report was that housing completions rose 5.2% in June and are now up 8.1% in the past year.  Further, building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since 2015 in June.  Expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones.  In other recent housing news, the NAHB index, which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated 64 in July from 67 in June.  Expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs, faster wage growth, and, for at least the time being, optimism about more market-friendly policies from the Trump Administration, continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders.  On the factory front, the Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing sentiment in New York, fell to a still healthy 9.8 in July from 19.8 in June. Finally, on inflation, import prices fell 0.2% in June but are up 1.5% from a year ago.  Export prices also fell 0.2% in June, but have increased 0.6% in the past year.  Both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in June 2016.

   Hey Government: It's Time to Get Serious!



Posted Under: Government • Monday Morning Outlook • Spending • Taxes


At eight years, the current economic recovery is the third longest on record.  Personal income, consumer spending, household assets, and net worth, are all at record highs.  Stock markets are at record highs.  Corporate profits are within striking distance of their all-time highs.  Federal tax receipts are at record highs.  
So, how is it possible that the federal budget, along with some state and local budgets, still look like they're in the middle of a nasty recession?
The answer: Government fiscal management is completely out of control.  Politicians find time to fret about Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods and won't stop bashing banks, but they've lost their ability to deal with their own fiscal reality.
The federal government is projected to run a nearly $700 billion deficit this year, and long-term forecasts suggest trillion dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.  Illinois and the City of Chicago are running chronic deficits, while New Jersey and New York are fiscal basket cases.
This makes the politicians of the 1990s look downright responsible.  In 1999, after a 10-year recovery, these entities were all running surpluses. But even if this recovery lasts 12 years, deficits will persist.  And what happens if there's another recession?
Politicians have claimed intellectual support for their fiscal irresponsibility from John Maynard Keynes.  He believed in deficit-spending to help cure the problems of weak consumer spending in a recession.  As a result, the Panic of 2008 gave cover to grow government, and they did so in spectacular fashion.  But that "emergency" spending then morphed into permanent overspending and chronic deficits.
Tax rates are higher today than in 1999, and the economy is bigger, but governments have consistently outspent the ability of taxpayers to fund it.
Even Keynes thought the government should roll back spending and get budget deficits under control in better economic times.  But politicians are long past seeking his intellectual support.  They love to lecture business-people about greedy human nature, yet can't turn that analysis on themselves.
Businesses and entrepreneurs create new things and build wealth.  Politicians redistribute that wealth.  And while some of what government does can help the economy, like providing defense or supporting property rights, the U.S. government has expanded well beyond that point.  Politicians have never been this reckless or fiscally irresponsible.
Whenever we say this, people ask; "what would you cut from the budget?"  And then, if you are actually brave enough to answer, you get attacked for "not caring." 
This needs to stop.  Illinois is in a death spiral.  Tax rate increases will chase more productive people out of the state, while ratcheting spending higher.  And just like Detroit and Puerto Rico, the state will go bankrupt.
The U.S. government is on this path, but, because it has the ability to fund itself with the best debt in the world, a true fiscal day of reckoning is still 15-20 years away.
Government spending needs to be peeled back everywhere.  It's no longer a case of picking and choosing.  And until that happens, the fiscal irresponsibility of the government is the number one threat to not only America, but the world.
No matter what politicians tell us, any pain caused by private sector greed will pale in comparison to the mayhem that collapsing governments can create.  Just look at Venezuela or Greece!  It's time to reset America's fiscal reality.  And if that means debt ceiling brinksmanship, shutting down the government, or moving to a simple majority on spending decisions, so be it.  It's time to get serious!

   Industrial Production Rose 0.4% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Industrial Production - Cap Utilization


 Implications:  Industrial production rose for the fifth consecutive month in June, beating consensus expectations and signaling an uptick in activity across the board.  The headline measure for industrial activity rose 0.4% in June and is now up 2% from a year ago.  Manufacturing, which excludes mining and utilities, bounced back in June, rising 0.2%.  This gain was primarily due to a 0.7% jump in the volatile auto sector, though "core" industrial production, which is manufacturing excluding autos, rose 0.1% as well.  Manufacturing has begun to accelerate recently, up at a 3.2% annual rate in the past three months versus a gain of 1.2% in the past year.  And this isn't just due to auto production either, both "core" and auto manufacturing are showing similar accelerating patterns in the past three months versus their year ago measures.  Another major contribution to today's headline number came from mining which jumped 1.6% in June, and is now up at an 18.4% annual rate in the past three months versus 9.9% in the past year.  Further, oil and gas-well drilling posted its thirteenth consecutive gain in June, jumping 6.9%, and is now up a massive 115% at an annual rate in the past three months.  Based on other commodity prices, we think oil prices are below "fair value" range, but with oil companies profitable at current prices mining should stay in recovery after the problems of the past two years.

   Retail Sales Declined 0.2% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Retail Sales


 Implications:   Retail sales were soft again in June, but don't take that as a sign consumer spending is rolling over or the economy as a whole is getting weaker.  Total retail sales slipped 0.2% in June and half of the drop in overall sales was due to lower gas prices. This normal volatility causes retail sales to drop three or four months during a year, even in a growing economy.  "Core" sales, which exclude autos, building materials, and gas, were also down 0.2%.  In spite of the weak month, for the second quarter as a whole, core sales were up at a healthy 3% annual rate versus the first quarter, consistent with our forecast that "real" (inflation-adjusted) consumer spending on goods and services combined, rose at about a 3% annual rate as well.  This is not a sign of a dying consumer.  Even with the 0.2% decline in total retail sales in June, they're still up 2.8% from a year ago, which is outstripping the 1.6% increase in the consumer price index.  Note that one area of continuing strength is among non-brick and mortar retailers, where sales rose 0.4% in June, are up 9.2% from a year ago, and now make up 10.9% of sales, the largest portion on record.  Expect a rebound in retail sales in the months ahead.  The fundamental trends that drive growth in consumer spending continue to look good.  These include healthy job growth, wage growth, and very low consumer financial obligations relative to historical norms. Although household debt is at a record high, household debts are the lowest relative to household assets since the peak of the internet boom almost 20 year ago.  In other news this morning, business inventories increased 0.3% in May.  Plugging this into our forecast, suggests real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in the second quarter, a little faster than the 2.1% average since the economic recovery started in mid-2009.

   The Consumer Price Index was Unchanged in June



Posted Under: CPI • Data Watch • Inflation


 Implications:  Consumer prices were unchanged in June and have been tame over recent months, but cries that a lull in inflation should give the Fed pause are overblown.  Consumer prices are up 1.6% in the past year, compared to a 1.0% increase in the twelve months ending June 2016 and a 0.1% increase for the period ending June 2015.  In other words, inflation is still in a rising trend.  Energy prices fell 1.6% in June, while food prices were flat.  Strip out the typically volatile food and energy components, and "core" CPI rose 0.1% in June and is up 1.7% in the past year.  Medical care and rent costs led "core" prices higher in June, rising 0.4% and 0.3% respectively, more than offsetting declining prices for autos.  We expect rents to accelerate in the year ahead as supply constraints get tighter in the housing market.  Meanwhile, energy prices should stop falling and rebound a bit.  Combined, these forces should push the CPI back above 2% around the end of the year.  The best news in today's report is that real average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in June.  These earnings are up 0.8% over the past year, up at a 1.3% annual rate over the past six months, and a 1.9% annual rate over the past three.  This acceleration signals that a loose monetary policy has led to a tighter labor market.  Because the Fed believes in the Phillips Curve, the trend of accelerating price and wage gains should have Fed officials focusing more on the potential for inflation to rise faster than desired as the jobless rate continues to fall below their long-term target.  That's why we expect the Fed to stick to their plan of starting to unwind the balance sheet while also raising rates one more time in 2017.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Insured Municipals Income Trust (IMIT0689)
	
		





Objective
The Insured Municipals Income Trust, a unit investment trust, invests in a portfolio of insured tax-exempt municipal bonds. The trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income* and to preserve capital.**
On the date of deposit, the bonds included in an Insured Municipals Income Trust have been rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if not rated as of the date of deposit, are insured by a bond insurer rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's. While no representation is made as to the insurer's ability to meet its commitments, this rating is due to the claims-paying ability of the insurers that provide coverage on the bonds in the trust's portfolio not on units of the trust. 
For further details as to the terms and limitations of the insurance, please consult a prospectus.




* A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes
** Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below the par value of the bond, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units.
The insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust, not on units of the trust.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
Please see the Information Supplement  for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units.
The insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust, not on units of the trust.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
Please see the Information Supplement  for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

The ______________ Revocable Living Trust

I, ______________, presently of ______________, California, (the "Grantor") declare and make this revocable living trust (the "Living Trust"). This Living Trust will be known as The ______________ Revocable Living Trust.
	
BACKGROUND:


The Grantor presently owns property (the "Property") as described in Schedule A.

The Grantor wishes to ensure that this Property and any income derived from this Property is managed and eventually distributed according to the following terms.



Trust Purpose

This Living Trust is created for the benefit of the Beneficiaries to ensure they are well provided for after the death of the Grantor, however during the lifetime of the Grantor, the interests of the Grantor will be considered primary and superior to the interests of the Beneficiaries. With this purpose, the primary asset management goal for this Living Trust will be the protection of the value of the Property. The secondary asset management goal for this Living Trust is to generate income and growth at a reasonable risk.

Trustee

During the lifetime of the Grantor, and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor will serve as the primary trustee (the "Primary Trustee") of this Living Trust.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust. If the Grantor should recover such that they are no longer considered incapacitated then the Grantor will resume their control of the management of this Living Trust.

Beneficiaries

Upon the death of the Grantor, the following individual(s) will comprise the beneficiaries (the "Beneficiaries") of this Living Trust: 

the residuary beneficiary, ______________ of ______________, California; and

any heir or issue of those beneficiaries that is entitled to a benefit under this Living Trust in the place of any then deceased beneficiary.



Assign and Convey Property to Living Trust

______________, as Grantor, has or will assign, convey and deliver all of the rights, title and interest in the Property as described in Schedule A of this document as a gift and without consideration, to be held by this Living Trust.

Amendment During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, alter or amend this Living Trust on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. Amendments may include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Grantor may change the number and identity of the Grantors, the Trustees, the Successor Trustees or the Beneficiaries.

The Grantor may add or withdraw property from this Living Trust.



This Living Trust may not be amended after the death of the Grantor.

Revocation During Grantor's Lifetime

At any time during the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the Grantor may, subject to the other provisions of this section, revoke this Living Trust in its entirety on delivery to the Successor Trustee of a written instrument signed by the Grantor. In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

After the death of the Grantor, the Qualified Beneficiaries may, by unanimous vote of all of the Qualified Beneficiaries, remove a Trustee for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Where there are no other resources available, and where the Trustee is compelled to do so, the Trustee may resolve any legally enforceable debts, taxes, reasonable funeral expenses, burial expenses and any expenses related to the final illness of the Grantor out of the resources of this Living Trust.

The Trustee may make the Final Distribution in any combination of cash and property. Property selection and valuation in the course of the Final Distribution will be made in the good faith discretion of the Trustee and will be binding on all Beneficiaries.



It is incumbent on the Trustee to act as fiduciaries, in good faith and in the best interest of the Living Trust.

All decisions of the acting Trustee, made in good faith, regarding the management of this Living Trust will be final and binding on all parties.

The above authority and powers granted to the Trustee are in addition to any powers and elective rights conferred by state or federal law or by other provision of this Living Trust and may be exercised as often as required, and without application to or approval by any court.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

						Frequently Asked Questions
Why should I have a Living Trust?A Living Trust is a useful estate planning tool that allows the user to arrange how some or all of their assets will be managed after their passing. A Last Will and Testament may help achieve a similar goal, but a Living Trust does not need to go through complicated and potentially expensive probate procedures. What is community property?In a community property jurisdiction, most property acquired during the marriage (except for gifts or inheritances) — the community property — is owned jointly by both spouses and is divided upon divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership is automatically presumed by law in the absence of specific evidence that would point to a contrary conclusion for a particular piece of property.Community property retains its community character when a couple move from a community to a noncommunity State.  Any property that each partner brings into the marriage or receives by gift, bequest or devise during marriage is called separate property (i.e., not community property).In the United States there are ten community property jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Alaska  allows couples to opt into a community property arrangement.If you have community property, then a joint living trust for married or domestic couples may be appropriate; otherwise, you are usually better off having individual living trusts.  If you want to proceed with a joint living trust, you should review all state law related to joint revocable trusts and property transfer considerations in your state of residence. In addition to being a community property or a non-community property state, your state may have other specific considerations related to creation of joint revocable trusts.

Upon the death of or during the incapacity of the Grantor, then ______________ of ______________, California (the "Successor Trustee") will serve as the acting Trustee of this Living Trust.

In the event of such revocation, the remaining Property will revert to the Grantor after all the debts and expenses attributable to the Living Trust have been paid.

This Living Trust may not be revoked after the death of the Grantor.

Distributions During the Lifetime of the Grantor

During the lifetime of the Grantor and while the Grantor is not incapacitated, the acting Trustee will distribute as much of the income and principal of the Living Trust to the Grantor as the Grantor may request. While the Grantor is incapacitated and no longer able to manage or continue to manage their own affairs, then the acting Trustee may withhold or make payments out of the resources of this Living Trust of any amount that the acting Trustee in their sole judgment deems appropriate for the maintenance, comfort and welfare of the Grantor.

Distributions Upon Death of the Grantor

Upon the death of the Grantor, and after resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will expeditiously act to distribute the remaining Property as directed in this section.

After resolving all applicable legal debts and obligations of the Grantor, the acting Trustee will distribute the remaining property in this Living Trust in EQUAL shares (individually the "Share" and collectively the "Shares") to the following Beneficiaries:

______________ of ______________, California.



Where a Beneficiary is a Minor Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution then the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Minor Beneficiary in a separate trust for that Minor Beneficiary under the same terms and conditions as outlined in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Minor Beneficiary until that Minor Beneficiary reaches the age of majority whereupon the then acting trustee(s) will pay or transfer the rest and residue of that Share to that Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Minor Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



Where a Beneficiary is an Adult Dependent Beneficiary at the time of the Final Distribution, the acting Trustee may, at their sole discretion:

Continue to act as trustee(s) by holding the Share of any Adult Dependent Beneficiary in a separate trust, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and to keep that Share invested, and pay the income or capital or as much of either or both as the then acting trustee(s) consider advisable for the maintenance, education, advancement or benefit of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary; or

Pay or transfer all capital, assets and property of that Share or the amount remaining of that Share of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of that Adult Dependent Beneficiary subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.



If any of the named Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days but do leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then the Specific Gift or the Share designated for that Beneficiary, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will be distributed per stirpes among those surviving heirs or issue. Where those surviving heirs or issue are not of the age of majority, the acting Trustee may pay or transfer all capital, assets and property attributable to those minor heirs or issue of that Beneficiary to any parent, custodian or guardian of those minor heirs or issue, subject to the same terms and conditions contained in this Living Trust, and the receipt by that parent, custodian or guardian will discharge all duties and obligations of the acting Trustee.

If any of the residual Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor, then the Share designated for that Beneficiary, will revert to the residue of this Living Trust.

If all of the successor Beneficiaries do not survive the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days and do not leave an heir or issue who survives the Grantor by at least thirty (30) days, then all of the remaining property in this Living Trust, of whatever kind and character, and wherever located, will revert to the estate of the Grantor.

If any of the real property to be distributed in this Living Trust remains subject to a mortgage at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that mortgaged property will take that property subject to that mortgage and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have the mortgage paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

If any of the personal property to be distributed in this Living Trust is subject to any encumbrances or liens at the time of the Final Distribution, then the Beneficiary taking that property will take that property subject to those encumbrances or liens and the Beneficiary will not be entitled to have any encumbrance or lien paid out or resolved from the remaining assets or residue of this Living Trust.

Trustee Bond

Subject to the laws of the State of California and any other applicable jurisdiction, no bond or security of any kind will be required of any Trustee appointed in this Living Trust agreement.

Trustee Liability

The Trustee will not be liable to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries for any action or failure to act resulting in loss or harm to this Living Trust, the Grantor or to the Beneficiaries except in the case of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or reckless indifference to the purposes of the trust or the interests of the Beneficiaries. A Trustee will only be responsible for his or her own acts and no Trustee will be liable for any act or actions occurring in the periods before or after the tenure of that Trustee. Any outstanding liabilities of a dead, resigning or removed Trustee are not discharged or affected by the Trustee's death, resignation or removal.

Trustee Death or Resignation

A Trustee may resign at any time for any reason upon at least 30 days' notice to the Grantor, if the Grantor is still alive, to any remaining Trustee, if there are any, and to the Qualified Beneficiaries. If a Trustee dies, that Trustee will cease to be a Trustee as of the date of their death. 

Trustee Removal

At any time after the death or disability of the Grantor, a Trustee or a Beneficiary may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to remove a Trustee. A Trustee may also be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.

Trustee Replacement

At any time where the Grantor is alive and not incapacitated and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by the Grantor.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where a Trustee has been removed, died, resigned or is no longer able to act as Trustee for any reason, and where a replacement Trustee is deemed necessary by the remaining acting Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a majority vote of all acting Trustees still able and authorized to act.

Where the Grantor is dead or incapacitated, and where the Living Trust is left with no Trustee, a replacement Trustee may be appointed by a unanimous vote of the Qualified Beneficiaries.

Revocable Living Trust Information
Alternate Names:
A Revocable Living Trust is also known as:

Living Trust
Grantor Trust
Inter-vivo Trust

What is a Revocable Living Trust?
A Revocable Living Trust is used in estate planning to designate who will receive your property when you die. The term "revocable" means that a trust can be amended or revoked at any time by its creator, and assets can be added or removed from the trust as needed. 
Parties in a Living Trust

Grantor/Trustor: The grantor, also called a trustor, is the individual who creates and funds the trust.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who will be managing the trust's assets. The trustee is most often the grantor, but he or she may assign someone else to be in control of the trust.
Co-grantors/Co-trustees: These two individuals, usually spouses, own and control the trust together. When one co-trustee dies, the other assumes full responsibility for the trust.
Successor Trustee: The successor trustee is the individual appointed to retain control of the trust when the primary trustee passes away or becomes incapacitated.

What Types of Property Can go Into a Living Trust?
Property with high monetary value is placed into a trust to protect it until the assets are ready to be transferred to the intended beneficiaries. Some examples include:

Real estate
Securities, such as stock, bonds, or mutual funds
Business interest
Bank/cash accounts and notes payable
Valuable personal property, such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, and more

Typically, property with low monetary value or assets that need to be insured, like vehicles, are not placed into a trust.
How do I Make a Living Trust?
To set up a Living Trust, you first create a Revocable Living Trust document and appoint a trustee. You may then list the property you will place in the trust, as well as your beneficiaries.
After executing your Living Trust document properly, you will need to transfer your property into the trust. This can be done by naming the trustee, for the trust, as the owner of your assets.
For instance, if you wish to put real estate in your trust, you need to transfer ownership of your property to that of the trust with a Quitclaim Deed or Warranty Deed, listing the trustee as the owner, for the trust.
Who Should Have a Living Trust?
Revocable Living Trusts are beneficial for those with complicated estate plans, and a significant amount of assets. With a trust, the individual, as trustee, retains control of their assets until they pass away or become incapacitated. It also allows a successor trustee to easily take over the duties and maintenance of the trust if you are suddenly injured or in an accident, and shields your finances and last wishes from the public probate process.
Other reasons someone might set up a trust is if they own real estate in another state, or wish to ensure ongoing financial support to a loved one after their death.
Those with relatively straightforward estate plans or couples who don't have many assets may not need a Living Trust.
Revocable Living Trust vs. Will
A Living Trust is similar to a Last Will and Testament in that it allows an individual to control what happens to their assets after death. The main difference is that a Living Trust does not need to go through probate, therefore lowering the cost and time it takes to distribute your assets after death.
Much like an executor carries out estate plans in a will, a successor trustee carries out the instructions in a Living Trust.
If you create a Living Trust, you still need to have a Last Will and Testament for any property you left out of the trust.
What is the Difference Between a Living Trust and a Living Will?
A Living Trust and Living Will are both used in estate planning. However, a trust is intended to secure assets, and control property, whereas a Living Will is a document used to spell out your medical wishes for your family and health care representatives if you suddenly become incapacitated.
Related Documents:

Last Will and Testament: A document that allows you to control where your assets go after death, and to name guardians for dependent children.
Living Will/Health Care Directive: A document used to express your medical wishes should you ever become unable to make health care decisions for yourself.
Quitclaim Deed: A document used to transfer a property title between two parties, without the warranties of a full, clear title.
Warranty Deed: A deed used by a seller to transfer property, with the guarantee of a clear title, to a buyer.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
