JetTool FT-Series
The JetTool FT-Series Waterjet Cutting Systems are one of the smallest and most economical robotic waterjet trimming solutions. Each FT-Series waterjet system features one or two wall-mounted DRS AccuTrim™ robots, each plumbed for high-pressure waterjet delivery, equipped with a high-performance waterjet nozzle and DRS' exclusive 6th-axis coil for improved part accessibility.
The FT-Series waterjet cutting systems are ideal for trimming fabric and non-woven materials, composites and plastics. They can be programmed to trim a variety of part sizes and shapes.
Safety is our number one priority. Each system is equipped with a variety of safety features (such as light curtains or scanners) designed to separate the operator from the trimming area, which results in a safer and more ergonomic operating environment.

            Property Description
    


This wonderful home sits on a beautiful homesite that backs to a conservation area. The split bedroom floor plan was designed for function and for privacy with a private master retreat. As you enter the front hall, you'll find an expansive great room that opens to a covered patio ideally located for outdoor living at its finest. An open kitchen with an eat-at island and elegant stainless steel appliances offers abundant storage with its closet pantry and 42-in. upper cabinets. Another great feature of this kitchen is that the sink looks out to the backyard allowing you to keep an eye on the kiddos as they play. The secondary bedrooms and bath are located off the kitchen towards the front of the home, while the secluded master suite is on the opposite side and sits at the rear of the home. The master suite features a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bath that includes a walk-in shower, large linen closet, and an executive-height vanity with dual sinks.
