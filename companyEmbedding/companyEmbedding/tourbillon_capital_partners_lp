Each of Long Alpha LLC, Long Alpha Ltd and Global Master Fund have entered into notional principal amount derivative agreements (the “Derivative Agreements”) in the form of cash settled swaps with respect to 1,012,413, 5,084,859 and 8,350,594 Shares, respectively (representing economic exposure comparable to approximately 1.2%, 5.9% and 9.7% of the Shares, respectively). Collectively, the Derivative Agreements held by the Reporting Persons represent economic exposure comparable to an interest in approximately 16.8% of the Shares outstanding. The Derivative Agreements provide each of Long Alpha LLC, Long Alpha Ltd and Global Master Fund with economic results that are comparable to the economic results of ownership. The Derivative Agreements do not provide the Reporting Persons with the power to vote or direct the voting or dispose of or direct the disposition of the shares that are referenced in the Derivative Agreements (such shares, the “Subject Shares”). The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership in the Subject Shares. The counterparties to the Derivative Agreements are unaffiliated third party financial institutions.

 
 

 
On November 12, 2015, the Reporting Persons entered into a Joint Filing Agreement (the “Joint Filing Agreement”),
in which the Reporting Persons agreed to the joint filing on behalf of each of them of statements on Schedule 13D with respect
to the securities of the Issuer to the extent required by applicable law. The Joint Filing Agreement is attached as Exhibit
99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

 
 

 
Other than as described herein, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships among the Reporting
Persons, or between the Reporting Persons and any other person, with respect to the securities of the Issuer.
