Upon acquisition NRIA has devised a 
17-month development plan that may 
be extended to a maximum of 20-
months but also may be accelerated 
that includes a complete renovation to 
efficiently maximize  modernize the 
usable square footage. The renovation 
period will be followed by an 
estimated 3-month marketing process 
completed by marketing partner: 
Compass whereby the finished 
condominium units proposed floor 
plans have been conservatively 
estimated to command ≈1400psf - 
1450psf based on a current sales 
comparison analysis.  
 
Accredited investors have the 
opportunity to invest and receive a 
12.0 annualized net return paid 
monthly in a Preferred Equity position 
guaranteed by the Sponsor. The 
investment is senior to the Sponsor’s 
equity but junior to first lien 
construction debt which is also 
guaranteed by the Sponsor and/or 
Borrowing entity. Investors will receive 
100 of principal and their targeted 
12.0 net return before the Sponsor 
participates in sale proceeds.  
 
NRIA is a private investment 
management and development firm 
with extensive experience in ground-
up construction and complete 
renovation of planned unit 
developments and townhomes in the 
northeast specifically the Philadelphia 
area and now expanding rapidly into 
areas of NYC. Over 700 construction 
starts successfully executed since 
2010 please see track record with 
over 20 projects currently progressing 
in Brooklyn and Philadelphia. 
 
NRIA’s investment process includes:  
i Targeting core urban areas in the 
midst of gentrification where we 
believe assets are located directly 
in the path of long-term rent unit 
sales and property value growth  
ii Acquiring what we feel is 
significantly underutilized real 
estate where we can create value 
in the community and for our 
investors  
iii Maintaining a highly-controlled 
audited development process and 
leveraging extensive underwriting 
credit and capital markets 
expertise to prudently execute on a 
growing opportunity set ultimately 
offering investors a scalable and 
repeatable investment profile. 
National Realty Investment Advisors “NRIA” or “Sponsor” 
invites accredited investors the opportunity to participate in 
the short-term acquisition complete renovation and 
conversion of a four-unit multifamily property the 
“Property” into a boutique three-unit high-end 
condominium development located in the prime Carroll 
Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn NY. The Property is 
currently under contract and will be NRIA’s seventh 
Brooklyn development of similar size  scope since mid-Q2 
2016. 
 
The Property is more specifically located on Summit Street 
between Hicks  Henry just 2.5-miles south of Manhattan 
1.5-miles from the Brooklyn Bridge and within a short-
walking distance to numerous subway lines making for an 
easy commute anywhere in NYC.  
 
The unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline 
background picture is the actual view from the Property’s 
to-be completed roof-deck a view which will remain intact 
given the lack of land and/or developable air rights in the 
area.

Estimated Condo Approval Timeline: 2-months after closing to finalize DOB plans +/- a couple weeks. Once plans are complete it is approximately 7-to-8 months max to

Estimated 3- month marketing time for the 
three-units followed by a projected sell-out by 
month 17-to-18.

Strong Seasoned Established Sponsorship: NRIA has a 10+ year track record across development construction management private equity capital markets asset management and operational expertise. The 
firm has successfully executed hundreds of construction starts within core urban markets since 2006 and consistently partners with many of the same regional team members to provide a highly-audited efficient 
development process within the Philadelphia and NYC markets. NRIA’s superior track record supports a growing investor base which ultimately creates a liquidity profile that is quite unique in real estate development. 
Notable milestones: 700+ starts since 2010 alone ≈500M in completed unit value since 2010.  
 
Unique Risk / Reward Investment Profile: Defined as a short duration 17-to-18-month high-yield investment - offering a 12.0 net return paid monthly.  NRIA believes the current pay structure compensates 
investors immediately and throughout the development process with an additional illiquidity premium generally reserved for longer-term investment profiles.   
 
Equity Cushion upon Exit and additional Sponsor Credit Enhancements: NRIA conservatively estimated total gross and net sales proceeds of 6.475 million and 6.183 million respectively implying an as-
completed PSF price of 1427 weighted average range: 1400psf - 1450psf compared to the breakeven PSF price of 1273 assuming a maximum project term of 20-months which would also leave investors 
with their preferred return and principal. Note as a normal course of due diligence NRIA had a third party “as completed” valuation done which yielded a gross value of 6.90 million 6.6 greater than our original 
conservative estimate. This equity cushion insures against a certain margin of error with the Sponsor eligible for profits only after sell-out. The Sponsor has made other significant credit enhancements available to the 
investors through:  
i The borrowing entity Summit Street Capital 143 LLC and flowing through to the managing member entity NRIA Brooklyn II LLC executing recourse to standard lender carve-outs and/or completion 
guarantees in addition to the completion guarantee provided by the general contractor. This structure is intended to mitigate and distribute any perceived risk associated with growing contingent liabilities. Due to 
the current ongoing negotiations with the construction lenders there also may be an element of cross-collateralization with the underlying Property and similar NRIA sponsored loans. The final structure will be 
detailed in the operating agreement however NRIA anticipated these structural nuances and enhanced the investors position further through … 
ii The NRIA Buy-Back agreement Put-Option whereby NRIA will acquire and pay investors for any unsold finished units at the end of the investment term in an amount guaranteed to return all investor capital. In 
the unlikely event the targeted sellout price points were not met the investment stability  low correlation of the NYC housing market vs. other markets broader SP and/or REIT volatility etc. see further 
information clearly make this an ideal longer-term rental investment for one of NRIA’s many high-net-worth partners utilizing their pledged asset loan option further information available.   
iii The NRIA fixed contractor cost agreement project management guarantees which covers all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates the need for additional investor capital calls.  
 
Ultimately these structural features further illustrate NRIA’s ability to execute and speak to how high we rank capital preservation.

The Property is located in a Prime Urban Growing area of Brooklyn: NYC’s largest and fastest growing borough population growth: +5.3 2010 – 2015 Brooklyn has over 2.6 million residents and if it was 
defined as its own City it would be the 4
th
 largest in the US. The Property is more specifically located within the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn and is just 2.5-miles from Manhattan and centrally located 
within walking distance to public transportation subway: nine separate lines. Brooklyn has emerged as an incubator for technology advertising media design and innovation which is shown through the i  ≈120 
increase in patent filings in Brooklyn over the last 5-years alone and ii the number of adults with advanced degrees moving to Brooklyn tripling from 2009 to 2013
1
 . Population  job growth shortage of new 
“affordable” supply continued household formation lack of developable air rights in the neighborhood and interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future are all important underlying fundamentals that should 
continue to drive robust growth for many years to come.  
 
Cost Efficiency: NRIA’s proprietary construction bidding process volume of purchasing and history with a core-team of development partners contractors architects engineers building suppliers etc. have 
effectively created certain economies of scale as it relates to overall project costs. Therefore NRIA will have a fixed contract cost agreement in place with our GC which will cover all cost overruns during the duration of 
the project and eliminates potential delays due solely to cost disputes etc. Construction costs for 143 Summit Street are estimated at 360psf with an appraised quality standard of “Q1” exceptional high-end custom 
build which is far less than quotes given by “retail” contractors as high as ≈550psf+.

Still if one were to argue we are heading towards 
a housing “bubble” there are three main 
obstacles to such a conclusion
1 
other than Price-
to-Income ratio note the NE region remains well 
below Western US regions charted below left. 
i Are there non-financial reasons for a high- 
PTI ratio Answer: Yes significant supply 
constraints in NYC especially Brooklyn 
where a lack of developable air rights will 
continue to provide a supply/demand 
equilibrium  
ii Are credit conditions deteriorating Answer: 
No and by extension 
iii Has leverage increased Answer: No. Why 
is the housing market in a better overall 
position today Simple – due to regulation 
lenders do not have an active securitization 
market to sell subprime loans nor would it 
be profitable for a lender given regulated 
reserve requirements. 
 
Population growth / household formation job 
growth a prolonged low-interest rate 
environment and lack of available “affordable” 
supply especially within NYC all bode very well 
for this specific type of short-term housing 
investment.  
 
US / NYC Housing Market 
 
 
Unprecedented monetary stimulus has led a long rally in 
treasury rates charted left: averaged 4 6-months prior 
to the decline in the NY Condo Price Index today 
≈1.6. 
 
As housing dynamics shift from market-to-market areas 
of NYC including Carroll Gardens the Property’s 
neighborhood actually witnessed an overall increase in 
home ownership rates throughout the broader US decline 
illustrated above  ≈28.7 mid-2000 to ≈37.1 by the 
end of 2014.  
 
Housing Prices: The US SP Case-Shiller 20-City Index 
declined ≈34 peak mid ‘06 to trough early ‘12 
while the SP Case-Shiller NYC Condominium Index 
declined ≈16 early ‘08 to early ‘12 charted above left.  
As illustrated due to insatiable demand NYC condo 
prices have surpassed the previous ‘height’ however 
today the credit  interest rate markets are vastly 
different with the 10-yr treasury ≈240bps lower than it 
was going into the previous ‘height’. 
 
The resiliency of the NYC housing market will 
undoubtedly continue as demand supports a shortened 
timeframe to find a floor in housing prices as well as 
rebound once that floor is found. The fact that the NYC 
markets followed the broader US housing market into the 
financial crisis by at least a year and a half US peak mid 
‘06 NYC peak early ‘08 allows for sufficient lead time to 
determine the viability of an investment as a rental.

SP  NYC Housing Correlation  
As broader markets have increasingly become more correlated over the 
years it is prudent for any Investor to be well educated on all variables within 
the credit equities and rates market. 
 
The first chart left simply illustrates the SP Index and NYC Condo Prices 
SP Case-Shiller NYC Condo Price Index back 15+ years. It is important to 
see at certain times when the equities market SP sold-off example: tech-
bubble of 2000 the NYC Condo market held-up relatively well. 
 
The second chart below left illustrates the year-over-year price changes in 
each Index over the same time frame. It is clear that the volatility in the 
equities market is much greater than that of the NYC Condo market in fact 
the correlation
1
 of the two over the last 15+ years is  35.   
 
Given this information the Property’s investment profile should be viewed as 
a stable short-duration investment and the fact these high-end “affordable” 
units do not compete with certain pockets of NYC that can be oversupplied 
with over-priced skyscraper units.  
 
 
 
 
 
1. Measured through a regression analysis. Based on the number of 
data points below ≈60 is generally considered uncorrelated.

The level of new “affordable” housing inventory in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn 
remains extremely low as a result there a limited number of good comparable sales. That 
said “145 Summit Street” is directly adjacent to the subject Property and commanding well 
above our projected sell-out value on a PSF basis.  
 
The lack of developable land and/or air rights will keep the supply/demand dynamic of 
condominium units stable for many years to come.

Upon acquisition, NRIA has devised a
17-month development plan (that may
be extended to a maximum of 20-
months, but also may be accelerated)
that includes a complete renovation to
efficiently maximize & modernize the
usable square footage. The renovation
period will be followed by an
estimated 3-month marketing process
(completed by marketing partner:
Compass), whereby the finished
condominium units (proposed floor
plans) have been conservatively
estimated to command ≈$1,400psf -
$1,450psf based on a current sales
comparison analysis.
Accredited investors have the
opportunity to invest and receive a
12.0% annualized net return, paid
monthly, in a Preferred Equity position
guaranteed by the Sponsor. The
investment is senior to the Sponsor’s
equity but junior to first lien
construction debt, which is also
guaranteed by the Sponsor and/or
Borrowing entity. Investors will receive
100% of principal and their targeted
12.0% net return before the Sponsor
participates in sale proceeds.
NRIA is a private investment,
management, and development firm
with extensive experience in ground-
up construction and complete
renovation of planned unit
developments and townhomes in the
northeast, specifically the Philadelphia
area and now expanding rapidly into
areas of NYC. Over 700 construction
starts successfully executed since
2010 (please see track record), with
over 20 projects currently progressing
in Brooklyn and Philadelphia.
NRIA’s investment process, includes:
(i) Targeting core urban areas in the
midst of gentrification, where we
believe assets are located directly
in the path of long-term rent, unit
sales, and property value growth,
(ii) Acquiring what we feel is
significantly underutilized real
estate, where we can create value
in the community and for our
investors,
(iii) Maintaining a highly-controlled,
audited, development process, and
leveraging extensive underwriting,
credit, and capital markets
expertise to prudently execute on a
growing opportunity set, ultimately
offering investors a scalable and
repeatable investment profile.
National Realty Investment Advisors (“NRIA” or “Sponsor”)
invites accredited investors the opportunity to participate in
the short-term acquisition, complete renovation, and
conversion of a four-unit multifamily property (the
“Property”) into a boutique three-unit high-end
condominium development, located in the prime Carroll
Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. The Property is
currently under contract, and will be NRIA’s seventh
Brooklyn development of similar size & scope since mid-Q2
2016.
The Property is more specifically located on Summit Street,
between Hicks & Henry, just 2.5-miles south of Manhattan,
1.5-miles from the Brooklyn Bridge, and within a short-
walking distance to numerous subway lines making for an
easy commute anywhere in NYC.
The unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline
(background picture) is the actual view from the Property’s
(to-be completed) roof-deck; a view which will remain intact
given the lack of land and/or developable air rights in the
area.

Estimated Condo Approval Timeline: 2-months after closing to finalize DOB plans (+/- a couple weeks). Once plans are complete, it is approximately 7-to-8 months (max) to
get through the NY AG Real Estate Dept. Therefore, NRIA has an estimated outside date of 12-months from signed contract or 10-months from closing (+/- a couple weeks).
Estimated 3- month marketing time for the
three-units, followed by a projected sell-out by
month 17-to-18.
Construction Timeline: NRIA expects the construction phase to last an estimated 14-months, commencing once all permits are procured within
45-days of closing.

1. Includes increase in FAR, common area loss, plus additional sellable space to-be created (i.e. 50% of outdoor terraces).
2. As a normal course of due diligence, NRIA had a third party “as completed” valuation done, which yielded a gross value
of $6,900,000 (6.6% greater than our original conservative estimate).

Strong, Seasoned, Established Sponsorship: NRIA has a 10+ year track record across development, construction management, private equity, capital markets, asset management, and operational expertise. The
firm has successfully executed hundreds of construction starts within core urban markets since 2006, and consistently partners with many of the same regional team members to provide a highly-audited, efficient
development process within the Philadelphia and NYC markets. NRIA’s superior track record supports a growing investor base, which ultimately creates a liquidity profile that is quite unique in real estate development.
Notable milestones: 700+ starts since 2010 alone, ≈$500M in completed unit value since 2010.
Unique Risk / Reward Investment Profile: Defined as a short duration (17-to-18-month), high-yield investment - offering a 12.0% net return, paid monthly. NRIA believes the current pay structure compensates
investors immediately and throughout the development process with an additional illiquidity premium generally reserved for longer-term investment profiles.
Equity Cushion upon Exit, and additional Sponsor Credit Enhancement(s): NRIA conservatively estimated total gross and net sales proceeds of $6.475 million and $6.183 million, respectively, implying an as-
completed PSF price of $1,427 (weighted average, range: $1,400psf - $1,450psf), compared to the breakeven PSF price of $1,273 (assuming a maximum project term of 20-months), which would also leave investors
with their preferred return and principal. Note, as a normal course of due diligence, NRIA had a third party “as completed” valuation done, which yielded a gross value of $6.90 million (6.6% greater than our original
conservative estimate). This equity cushion insures against a certain margin of error, with the Sponsor eligible for profits only after sell-out. The Sponsor has made other significant credit enhancements available to the
investors through:
(i) The borrowing entity (Summit Street Capital 143, LLC), and flowing through to the managing member entity (NRIA Brooklyn II, LLC) executing recourse to standard lender carve-outs and/or completion
guarantees, in addition to the completion guarantee provided by the general contractor. This structure is intended to mitigate and distribute any perceived risk associated with growing contingent liabilities. Due to
the [current] ongoing negotiations with the construction lender(s), there also may be an element of cross-collateralization with the underlying Property and similar NRIA sponsored loans. The final structure will be
detailed in the operating agreement; however, NRIA anticipated these structural nuances and enhanced the investors position further through …
(ii) The NRIA Buy-Back agreement (Put-Option), whereby NRIA will acquire and pay investors for any unsold finished unit(s) at the end of the investment term in an amount guaranteed to return all investor capital. In
the unlikely event the targeted sellout price points were not met, the investment stability & low correlation of the NYC housing market vs. other markets, broader S&P and/or REIT volatility, etc. (see further
information), clearly make this an ideal longer-term rental investment for one of NRIA’s many high-net-worth partners utilizing their pledged asset loan option (further information available).
(iii) The NRIA fixed contractor cost agreement (project management guarantees), which covers all cost overruns during the duration of the project and eliminates the need for additional investor capital calls.
Ultimately, these structural features further illustrate NRIA’s ability to execute, and speak to how high we rank capital preservation.

The Property is located in a Prime, Urban, Growing area of Brooklyn: NYC’s largest and fastest growing borough (population growth: +5.3%, 2010 – 2015), Brooklyn has over 2.6 million residents, and if it was
defined as its own City it would be the 4th largest in the US. The Property is more specifically located within the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, and is just 2.5-miles from Manhattan, and centrally located
within walking distance to public transportation (subway: nine separate lines). Brooklyn has emerged as an incubator for technology, advertising, media, design, and innovation, which is shown through the (i) ≈120%
increase in patent filings in Brooklyn over the last 5-years alone, and (ii) the number of adults with advanced degrees moving to Brooklyn tripling from 2009 to 20131 . Population & job growth, shortage of new
“affordable” supply, continued household formation, lack of developable air rights in the neighborhood, and interest rates remaining low for the foreseeable future, are all important underlying fundamentals that should
continue to drive robust growth for many years to come.
Cost Efficiency: NRIA’s proprietary construction bidding process, volume of purchasing, and history with a core-team of development partners (contractors, architects, engineers, building suppliers, etc.), have
effectively created certain economies of scale as it relates to overall project costs. Therefore, NRIA will have a fixed contract cost agreement in place with our GC, which will cover all cost overruns during the duration of
the project and eliminates potential delays due solely to cost disputes, etc. Construction costs for 143 Summit Street are estimated at $360psf with an appraised quality standard of “Q1” (exceptional, high-end custom
build), which is far less than quotes given by “retail” contractors as high as ≈$550psf(+).

Still, if one were to argue we are heading towards
a housing “bubble;” there are three main
obstacles to such a conclusion1 other than Price-
to-Income ratio (note, the NE region remains well
below Western US regions, charted below left).
(i) Are there non-financial reasons for a high-
PTI ratio? Answer: Yes, significant supply
constraints in NYC, especially Brooklyn,
where a lack of developable air rights will
continue to provide a supply/demand
equilibrium,
(ii) Are credit conditions deteriorating? Answer:
No, and by extension,
(iii) Has leverage increased? Answer: No. Why
is the housing market in a better overall
position today? Simple – due to regulation,
lenders do not have an active securitization
market to sell subprime loans, nor would it
be profitable for a lender given regulated
reserve requirements.
Population growth / household formation, job
growth, a prolonged low-interest rate
environment, and lack of available “affordable”
supply, especially within NYC, all bode very well
for this specific type of short-term housing
investment.
US / NYC Housing Market Unprecedented monetary stimulus has led a long rally in
treasury rates (charted left: averaged 4% 6-months prior
to the decline in the NY Condo Price Index, today
≈1.6%).
As housing dynamics shift from market-to-market, areas
of NYC, including Carroll Gardens (the Property’s
neighborhood) actually witnessed an overall increase in
home ownership rates throughout the broader US decline
illustrated above (≈28.7% mid-2000 to ≈37.1% by the
end of 2014).
Housing Prices: The US S&P Case-Shiller 20-City Index
declined ≈34%, peak (mid ‘06) to trough (early ‘12),
while the S&P Case-Shiller NYC Condominium Index
declined ≈16% (early ‘08 to early ‘12, charted above left).
As illustrated, due to insatiable demand, NYC condo
prices have surpassed the previous ‘height’; however,
today the credit & interest rate markets are vastly
different, with the 10-yr treasury ≈240bps lower than it
was going into the previous ‘height’.
The resiliency of the NYC housing market will
undoubtedly continue as demand supports a shortened
timeframe to find a floor in housing prices as well as
rebound once that floor is found. The fact that the NYC
markets followed the broader US housing market into the
financial crisis by at least a year and a half (US peak mid
‘06, NYC peak early ‘08), allows for sufficient lead time to
determine the viability of an investment as a rental.

S&P & NYC Housing Correlation (?)
As broader markets have increasingly become more correlated over the
years, it is prudent for any Investor to be well educated on all variables within
the credit, equities, and rates market.
The first chart (left) simply illustrates the S&P Index and NYC Condo Prices
(S&P Case-Shiller NYC Condo Price Index) back 15+ years. It is important to
see at certain times when the equities market (S&P) sold-off (example: tech-
bubble of 2000), the NYC Condo market held-up relatively well.
The second chart (below, left) illustrates the year-over-year price changes in
each Index over the same time frame. It is clear that the volatility in the
equities market is much greater than that of the NYC Condo market, in fact,
the correlation1 of the two over the last 15+ years is < 35%.
Given this information, the Property’s investment profile should be viewed as
a stable, short-duration investment, and the fact these high-end “affordable”
units do not compete with certain pockets of NYC that can be oversupplied
with over-priced skyscraper units.
1. Measured through a regression analysis. Based on the number of
data points, below ≈60% is generally considered uncorrelated.

143 Summit, Conservatively Estimated Sell-Out $1,400psf - $1,450psf
The level of new “affordable” housing inventory in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn
remains extremely low, as a result there a limited number of good comparable sales. That
said, “145 Summit Street” is directly adjacent to the subject Property, and commanding well
above our projected sell-out value (on a PSF basis).
The lack of developable land and/or air rights will keep the supply/demand dynamic of
condominium units stable for many years to come.
