Thought leadership - 25/07/2017
Brexit can no longer be ignored by a troubled charity sector



Charities in the UK were quiet around the country’s EU Referendum vote in June 2016.  Except for those lamenting the likely loss of EU funding, the majority of charities in the UK did not see Brexit as a pressing priority, since most deliver their services in the UK.


	 



Investment Strategy - 24/07/2017
CIO Viewpoint: Emerging Markets - can outperformance continue?





	Emerging markets were star performers in the first half of 2017, and we retain our long-standing overweight to emerging market equities and local currency debt. Here we consider risks ahead - in US rates, oil, China and Brazil – and how investors should navigate this changing landscape.

	Stéphane Monier
	Head of Investments, Lombard Odier Private Bank
	 



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 21/07/2017
Asset Allocation – Towards an inflexion point in ECB policy





	The “goldilocks” economic environment of improving growth and stable inflation  leads us to maintain our risk-on investment stance.

	Now that political concerns have abated, investor focus is shifting back to fundamentals. The particularly improved picture in the Eurozone warrants continued preference for European equities.

	The corollary is that an inflexion point in ECB non-conventional monetary measures lies ahead, quite probably the main game changer of coming quarters: we have thus begun to position portfolios for euro appreciation.

	The impact of a tighter ECB stance on European bond markets will need to be closely monitored: higher core yields, wider spreads?

	Oil seems the only potential disruptive factor in this ultra-low volatility world. At this point, we reaffirm our range-bound scenario.



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 20/07/2017
Emerging Markets - China spreading its influence





	Asian economic and trade conditions are looking good, with China progressively replacing the US as the dominant force in the region.

	Reduced dependence on the US market makes Asian exporters less vulnerable to any protectionist measures that could be taken by the Trump administration.

	Downside risks to the Russian economy have subsided, but the same cannot be said about Brazilian politics.



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 19/07/2017
Japan - As good as it gets





	Japan’s cyclical conditions remains solid, with growing domestic consumption and investment – and even incipient signs of wage inflation in some segments of the labour market.

	The monetary policy framework unfortunately ties the economic outlook largely to external factors such as crude oil prices, US fiscal policy and geopolitics.

	The recent Tokyo assembly election results will drive doubts about Prime Minister Abe’s political longevity, heralding a return of factional competition and leadership uncertainty.



Thought leadership - 18/07/2017
Rethinking family governance



The wealth and structure of your family or your family business will change in line with economic, technological and sociological developments, and with new generations taking over the reins. These changes may not always have positive repercussions on your wealth, and could even diminish it. 


	 



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 17/07/2017
Europe - Euroscepticism losing ground





	Euroscepticism is on the wane, after a series of populist party defeats in recent elections. Nevertheless, the situation in Italy and the popularity of Five Star Movement bear close monitoring.

	The European economic recovery is broadening, with improving external demand adding to already robust domestic activity.

	Progressive (rather than sharp) ECB policy normalisation is likely going forward.



Thought leadership - 13/07/2017
France Embraces Digital Revolution



Benoit Peligry, local managing director at Lombard Odier’s Paris office, and Coralie Jaxel, private banker in charge of the initiative, discuss our partnership with France Digitale, and the opportunities and challenges facing start-ups and entrepreneurs in France.


		 



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 12/07/2017
United States - Neither inflation, nor recession





	The multi-year recovery of the US economy proceeds apace, with no signs of overheating.

	The lack of inflationary pressures should limit the Fed’s leeway to raise rates much further, paving the way for balance sheet management.

	Recession signals are also absent for now, pushing that risk out at least 12 to 18 months.



Quarterly Investment Strategy - 10/07/2017
Mid-year review: so far, so good





	Halfway into the year, let us pause to reflect on the global economic and financial situation. The good news is that many of the risks outlined in our 2017 outlook have abated, buttressing our view that a worldwide recession is not on the horizon.

How will Brexit shape Britain’s relationship with the continent?

Does Brexit really signal the end for globalisation?


By John Arlidge
Wednesday 21 September 2016



contact us

 The world changed forever on 23 June 2016, when the British public voted to leave the European Union (EU) after more than 40 years. The immediate fallout was extreme: global stock markets tumbled, while the pound plummeted to a 31-year low. Much of this initial reaction has since been reversed, with European stock markets including the FTSE 100 rebounding to pre-referendum levels. But with years of exit negotiations ahead, the Brexit effect is far from over.

 Following are just two views on what is an extraordinarily multi-faceted subject. The picture may still be developing but it’s already time to “rethink Brexit”.
Brexit Globalisation








The UK’s historic vote to leave the European Union opened debate in all parts of the world on the cracks in the philosophy of a European community. What impact does Brexit still to have on our markets? 

 Globalisation is good. Or, rather, it used to be. Britain’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union is making many rethink the liberal economic order.

 Many Britons voted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc in protest at the free movement of people and money that they blame for impoverishing them and making it harder for them to find school places for their children and hospital appointments for their family.

 Their action has encouraged others. Most notably in Europe and the US, where antipathy towards globalisation crosses the political spectrum.

 As isolationist sentiment grows, its impact is beginning to be felt in the markets. One of the reasons why sterling fell in value by around 10% after the Brexit vote in June is that investors believe Britain will be a less competitive economy outside the integrated EU economy and the Eurozone. Beyond Europe, figures from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) show that export growth among developing countries fell to a meagre 1.3% in 2014 - a precipitous decline from more than 30% in 2010.

 In July 2016 the IMF slashed its forecast for global trade growth for the umpteenth time. This year will be the sixth year in a row that world trade has been flat or falling as a share of the global economy - after decades when trade was rising faster than the world economy and the engine of prosperity for emerging market economies.

 Small wonder that many are now calling time on an economic order that has endured since the latter half of the last century. Martin Wolf now questions whether capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible.

 capitalism and liberal democracy might turn out to be incompatible

 The good news for those who believe that free global trade is a long-term net win for trading partners and for global prosperity is that, while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world, others are forging ahead.

 while some western governments and voters may want to detach from an interconnected world, others are forging ahead

 WTO figures show that while overall export growth among developing countries may be slowing, trade between developing nations is rising sharply. Some 52% of developing countries’ exports went to other emerging economies in 2014 up from 38% 20 years ago. Trade between China and India was $1.7bn in 1997. By 2014 it had reached $72bn India’s total trade with Africa grew more than 60% in only four years, to almost $48bn in 2014-15

 Chinese companies invested $111bn around the world in 2015 - more than ten times the amount in 2005, figures from the American Enterprise Institute show. The total that Indian companies have invested abroad - $139bn in 2015 - has risen 43% in the past five years.

 What’s more, there are signs of a rearguard action by the liberal market brigade. French - yes, French - Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron has resigned from the government. The 38-year-old former investment banker is expected to run for the presidency under a pro-integration, pro open markets banner. Polls in France show also support for EU rising since Brexit vote. In the Spanish general election, that took place just after the Brexit referendum, support for the mainstream centre right rose, while the radical fringe lost support.

 Perhaps the shock of Brexit has given the supporters of globalisation just the jolt they needed. It is some - small - comfort for “Bremain” supporters if their loss turns out to be globalisation's gain.

  Samy Chaar on Brexit


By Jessica Bown
 Wednesday 21 September 2016

Lombard Odier’s Chief Economist Samy Chaar believes the short-term impact of the Brexit vote on global stock markets has already been erased, but that the ongoing uncertainty is a serious risk. What impact has the result of the European Union (EU) referendum had on European stock markets?

What impact has the result of the European Union (EU) referendum had on European stock markets? 
 Global markets all went down on the morning after the vote. However, if you look at any European index now, they are all trading back at above June levels. In other words, the effect has been completely erased.

What impact do you expect it to have longer term?
 Europe currently provides 50% of foreign investment into the UK, so Brexit could be a real game changer for the UK economy. European markets may also be affected if other EU countries vote to leave the union, but this seems unlikely at this stage.

Does Brexit threaten London’s status as a financial hub?
 The short answer is yes. Of the 400 major banks in the City, more than two thirds are foreign, and a big chunk are there to operate in Europe. However, cities such as Paris and Frankfurt are not ready to replace London as Europe’s main financial hub. So it is not the end of the City as we know it.

Do you believe Brexit will have political ramifications elsewhere in the world?
 Internationally, anti-establishment sentiment is pushing people towards political extremes. But while there is exasperation with the EU in other European countries, these countries have stronger ties to the union, not least because they have the euro. Even in Italy, there is little appetite to return to the lira.

What do you expect to happen to UK interest rates?
 Short term, I do not expect UK interest rates to change. However, sterling has taken a hit and the UK has very little manufacturing. The higher cost of imports will therefore drive inflation, creating another problem for the Bank of England.

What effect will Brexit have on real estate in the UK?
 Lower interest rates are good news for property investors – and the depreciation of the pound acts as a cushion. But the prime London property market is dependent on investment from Europe, Russia and the Middle East. So there is vulnerability, especially as these properties are so overvalued.

What are the biggest risks facing investors during the exit negotiations?
 Uncertainty is the undoubtedly the biggest issue for investors at this time. It’s going to be a long process and, for the UK, a lot depends on the economic model put forward by Theresa May. We should have a better idea of what she is planning after the Autumn Statement on 23 November 2016.

What can investors do to protect themselves against the risks linked to Brexit?
 Investors should think on a global scale and seek exposure to countries that will not be impacted by this issue. Emerging markets are one example of this. They are volatile, but could provide a 6% yield. Our view is to have a well-balanced portfolio that preserves your capital and gives you a little something on top.

What investment opportunities may arise from Brexit?
 One possibility is that, as the balance of power in Europe shifts, the Eurozone – rather than the EU, which is bigger and less flexible – will wield greater international power.

How will young entrepreneurs change the face of wealth?



By Amy Guttman
Wednesday 21 September 2016



contact us

 There is a new status quo in the world of power and ambition. Millennial entrepreneurs lead the charge in innovation and investment, and there are more millionaires under the age of 21 than ever before. But as bedrooms become boardrooms and university assignments become the next tech start-ups, how will this new generation change the face of wealth?
The millennial generation








 The millennial generation is defined by entrepreneurship more than anything else. And, with more millionaires under the age of 21 than ever before, they are changing the face of wealth and investing. Millennials are not only creating disruptive technologies; they’re expecting the same thinking applied from the companies they do business with. Innovation, seamless ease of use, and transparency are now key components of the value chain. That’s good news for the rest of us, as it’s forcing traditional companies across multiple sectors to adapt or be surpassed.

 Technology and attitudes about wealth are just two of the things that separate today’s young entrepreneurs from other generations.

 These fresh-faced founders grew up customising their own Nikes; even X-box controllers were produced by their own design. It’s no wonder tailored services are now expected, rather than seen as an extra. And when they see a gap in the market, they set up their own companies to address those needs.

 Take 26-year old Londoner Daniel Attia. He didn’t think estate agents were earning their 2% (on average) fees, so he co-founded Yopa.co.uk, an online home buying and selling service with a simple, stratified fee structure. The site launched last year and is creating a buzz in the UK’s billion-pound property business.

 Attia and his business partners together have decades of experience in the property market. They’ve seen how it works from the inside, but are young and hungry enough to follow their instinct, which is that there’s a better, more democratic way to do business. Crucially, they also know that if they don’t disrupt traditional, heavily fee-based industries, someone else will.

 “This is the last real archaic industry that we could see that really hasn’t been touched for so many years. It was just waiting for someone to come and really change it and disrupt it,” Attia says.

 Clients choose from three different fee tiers with total transparency. For entrepreneurs like Attia, that transparency, and strong customer service are the cornerstones of any new business these days. His office responds to calls and emails seven days a week. “Eventually, we want a member of our team to be in the office 24 hours, every day.”

 The benefits of an increasing push from millennial entrepreneurs to deliver on service, convenience and price is creating a positive impact across all sectors.

 There’s a sense that the 20-something tech founders know more about almost everything than any other generation. But, the irony about these young entrepreneurs making their first millions is that their attitudes towards wealth and investing are totally different from those of their parents and other generations.

 Adults born after 1985 grew up in a recession which, understandably, helped shape a fairly conservative view towards investing in the stock market. It also created a sensitivity to market volatility. Although millennials have less financial knowledge than their parents, they have a faster route to wealth, not just from their own successful startups, but also through inheritance.

 More millennial millionaires have inherited wealth than any other generation, according to a study published earlier this year that found that 45 percent of millennials (aged 18-35) had affluent parents, compared with just 28 percent of Gen-X millionaires and 18 percent of baby boomer millionaires. The fiscal safety net has helped drive entrepreneurship among millennials, but is also pushing changes in the way financial advisors interact with customers.

 One California public relations director recently lamented about new client meetings with young tech founders. Typically an hour is scheduled, yet young entrepreneurs are insisting on meetings of no more than 30 minutes. Millennials are changing the rules – replacing long, fancy lunches for short meetings over coffee. Financial advisors are honing their three-minute elevator pitch, rather than poring over pages of documents to prove the value of an investment.

 young entrepreneurs are insisting on meetings of no more than 30 minutes.

 By extension, young entrepreneurs want to be talked to in clear, straightforward terms. Not for them opaque fee structures wrapped up in complicated jargon. Because of startups like Yopa, and Antlos, which allows the non-elite to charter boats and yachts AirBNB-style with upfront pricing, fees without the cloaked mystery are becoming the norm, whether it’s renting a yacht, or making an investment. A report on millennial wealth management by Deloitte suggests performance-based fees, rather than flat fees.

 This is a generation that has taken investment clubs to the next level. Entire online communities connect investors around the world to share ideas and strategies. Millennials are the generation that made cutthroat a bad word, and collaboration paramount. Their willingness to embrace radical transparency, and disclose their holdings to members of their community, online or otherwise, is no different. Entrepreneur Jon Medved (not a millennial) founded OurCrowd to democratise venture capital. With a minimum net worth of USD $1M, anyone can invest alongside billionaires and venture capital gurus. The price of entry is just USD $2,500 and OurCrowd investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, GE and others.

 Millennials are the generation that made cutthroat a bad word, and collaboration paramount.

 The opportunity to get in on an Uber or Google before the share price skyrockets is one benefit of sites like OurCrowd. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, who pledged 99% of their shares in the social media site, with a value of USD $46B, to charitable causes, represent their generation. Other millennials may not have the resources to give away a billion dollars a year for the next three years the way Zuckerberg can, but the commitment to philanthropy and social causes is an important factor for these new millionaires when deciding where to put their money. For this generation, money is not the sole indicator of success, nor do material goods provide the instant gratification they seek; it’s quality of life that matters most.

 Seventy percent of America’s 2016 university graduates are more concerned with office culture than compensation. Nearly all of them believe it’s important to work for a socially responsible company and value personal and professional growth over a higher income. That could explain why, in the city of Chicago, alone, the number of MBAs taking jobs at technology firms (rather than finance) has risen from 6% to more than 12% since 2007.

 Further proof resides in Silicon Valley. Stock options and more zeros on their annual salaries aren’t the things that tempt hotshot developers to switch companies. It’s the flexible work hours, a positive environment, and convenient amenities that have the real value. The ability to work remotely full-time, or even for a few months a year, along with authenticity – a brand that’s true to its customer and its employees are like gold dust. They apply the same expectations of an employer to the companies they work with or patronise, which means that we’re only going to see more brand partnerships be it a social cause, creative or tech.

 There is a sense of obligation to create positive change in the world, which makes alternative or impact investments attractive to 70% percent of millenials. The desire to play an active role in the world isn’t limited to business. It affects their decisions across all aspects of their lives: how and where to travel, and which experiences to seek.

 There is a sense of obligation to create positive change in the world, which makes alternative or impact investments attractive to 70% of millenials.

 It’s never been more important for financial services and other companies to either adapt to suit these new customers, or partner with businesses who can fill the gaps. The emerging affluent are now those with investable assets of USD$50,000 - 250,000 and an annual income of $100,000. The face of wealth is changing and millionaire millennial entrepreneurs are here to stay. After all, young founders may start small, but when they work out the secret to a successful startup, how high is up?

Lombard Odier was founded in 1796 in Geneva, where it has its headquarters. The bank, which has been a family business for seven generations, is run by its partners. They are both owners and managers, and they are equally involved in strategy and management as well as client services.
The bank, which is present in all the world's major financial centres, has a network of 26 offices covering 19 jurisdictions and employs around 2,180 people.
Some years ago, Lombard Odier decided to accelerate the development of its private-client activities in Europe, Asia and Switzerland, strengthen its asset management services, and make its technology platform available to finance professionals.
Key figures[edit]

Activities[edit]
The group is organised around three areas of activity with total client assets of CHF 224 billion.
Private clients[2]
Lombard Odier offers its private clients a range of wealth management solutions such as portfolio management under a discretionary or advisory mandate, succession planning, tax reporting, or custody services.
Asset management unit[5]
Through its branch LOIM (Lombard Odier Investment Managers), Lombard Odier offers its clients risk-based asset allocation, themed equity investments, convertible bonds, and absolute return strategies.
Technology and banking services
Lombard Odier provides clients of banking and technology services with access to its IT and operational infrastructure, as well as global custody and reporting services.
Other[edit]
