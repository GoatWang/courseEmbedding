Zacks Investment Research Downgrades Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) to Strong Sell

					Posted by Michael Walen on Jul 13th, 2017 // No Comments 




Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “strong sell” rating in a report issued on Tuesday. 
According to Zacks, “Avon has lagged the broader industry in the last six months, largely due to its dismal surprise history. The company has posted lower-than-expected bottom-line results for three straight quarters now, with a loss in the last quarter. Avon continues to face lower Active Representatives, though it is on track to improve the same. Estimates have been going down ahead of the second quarter release. The company remains prone to stiff competition, and other macroeconomic hurdles. Further, management expects the second quarter to remain troubled. However, we remain impressed with Avon’s progress with its Transformation Plan, which started its second year, this quarter. The company is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Also, it is confident of achieving its long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.”

Product Overview

                        The case is designed to explore the structure and rationale behind the standard compensation arrangements in the private equity (PE) industry. It effectively introduces students to commonly used terms of limited partnership agreements (LPAs), such as fees, carried interest, and preferred terms or hurdle rates. The backdrop for the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund (OPERF) case is the changed market conditions following the 2007 financial crisis that spurred a reevaluation of the basic terms of LPAs across the PE industry. 

This case has been taught in a second-year elective course on entrepreneurial finance and private equity and would be suitable for similarly focused courses on venture capital, private equity, or entrepreneurship. The case can also be used in an investment class designed to explore private equity as an asset class.

                    
Learning Objectives
? Provide an understanding of the basics terms of compensation for PE funds.
? Distinguish the tradeoffs between fees and carried interest.
? Outline the benefits and drawbacks of various fee structures.
? Develop an ability to model the cash flows to LPs and GPs of a PE fund.
? Construct commonly used performance metrics, such as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) of LP and GP cash flows, to assess fund performance.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: August 08, 2011

 The case is designed to explore the structure and rationale behind the standard compensation arrangements in the private equity (PE) industry. It effectively introduces students to commonly used terms of limited partnership agreements (LPAs), such as fees, carried interest, and preferred terms or hurdle rates. The backdrop for the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund (OPERF) case is the changed market conditions following the 2007 financial crisis that spurred a reevaluation of the basic terms of LPAs across the PE industry. This case has been taught in a second-year elective course on entrepreneurial finance and private equity and would be suitable for similarly focused courses on venture capital, private equity, or entrepreneurship. The case can also be used in an investment class designed to explore private equity as an asset class.
