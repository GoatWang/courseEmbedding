CloseTruly Protect Your Family.
Introducing the Multi-Secure, Fast Access SMART 2™.
Sign up for Exclusive UpdatesPIN Code Access
The SMART 2™ prevents unauthorized firing but unlocks in under a second with your PIN code. Releasing the grip safety re-locks the gun in one-third of a second and guards against take-away.
Secured System
Our patented THEFT GUARD™ system deters unauthorized handling, tampering and theft with a loud motion-triggered alarm. Resists physical hacking and there’s no wireless access. Outside of a larger safe, no other gun can protect like this.
Practical, Reliable, Ready
The SMART 2™ is the first practical user-authorized gun. It has a long life battery, and will be fully tested to rigorous standards and certified by third party labs. The reliability of the locking system will be several times greater than that of the base firearm.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why do I need the Smart 2™?

To protect my home and family, my gun needs to be instantly available, but keeping a loaded, unlocked accessible gun has safety and legal risks.
Why not just use a gun safe or trigger lock?

A conventional trigger lock and key are not practical if the gun is needed in an instant. The Smart 2™ allows faster access than a gun safe or trigger lock, and can be moved to where you are, for example from your bedside to your kitchen drawer. The Smart 2™ also features a 12-hour unlock mode to provide the readiness of a conventional gun when desired. In addition a small gun safe can be stolen.
Is the Smart 2™ a “smart gun”?

The patented Smart 2™ – 9MM pistol is nothing like those referred to in the media as “smart guns”. The SMART 2™ uses a PIN code lock which is very simple and more practical than technology such as fingerprint readers or “RFID” that require companion rings or watches. Additionally, our exclusive THEFT GUARD and other features protect against unauthorized handling, tampering and theft, which puts the Smart 2™ in a whole new category.
How can I trust that it is reliable?

The Smart 2™ will be fully tested to rigorous standards and certified by third party labs. It will meet, or exceed, the upcoming performance and reliability standards for personalized guns released by the National Institute of Justice. The reliability of the locking system will be significantly greater than the reliability base firearm.
The Smart 2™ is built upon proven rugged technology, such as the technology found on aircraft, in automobiles, and in the military. Methods and means to make our electronics and systems rugged are well known. They are in widespread use in life-critical and battle-critical situations.
Should a gun rely on batteries that may fail at a critical time?

The SMART 2™ will feature a long life battery, like those in critical electronics we depend on every day, such as smoke detectors, heart pacemakers. A low battery indicator blinks when it’s time to change the batteries, and if ignored, an alarm will sound.
Why a PIN code?

A PIN (Personal Identification Number) code entry can be rehearsed, memorized and completed in a second. The durable lighted keypad can be used without problem in any environment. PIN codes entry is one of the most proven and commonly used methods of user verification today, with thousands of code combinations possible. Combined with our THEFT GUARD alarm, PIN codes are quite secure.
A PIN Code is not as fast as an unlocked Gun

While the Smart 2™ may not work for individuals wanting to keep a loaded and unlocked gun nearby, it’s a better alternative to a trigger guard or gun safe, offering a multi-secure and fast access solution. It also has an optional 12-hour unlock mode, so it can function as a conventional gun when needed.
What is Theft Guard and how does it work?

A: THEFT GUARD is a motion sensitive alarm system that sounds an ear-piercing alarm if the Smart 2™ is moved or handled without the proper PIN code entered within a countdown period, for example, after 10 seconds. It protects against unauthorized handling, tampering and theft. It can be optionally turned off.
Can the Smart 2™  be “hacked” or externally controlled?

The Smart 2™ is designed to be “un-hackable”. A gun that can be hacked, controlled or disabled by someone else (including the government or terrorists) should not be sold since such a weakness could deny your right to keep and bear arms and to defend yourself. The SMART 2’s only input is the keypad, and it can only be unlocked with your PIN code. It does not have any wireless communication, such as WiFi, RFID,Bluetooth or GPS.
Can the locking components be tampered with or disabled by a teen with a screwdriver or wrench?

The gun safety components are locked in the grip when the gun is locked, deterring a potentially tragic result. Handling the Smart 2™ for longer than the allotted time will sound its THEFT GUARD alarm.
What’s wrong with fingerprint readers?

Fingerprint readers have significant reliability issues. In real-world use, fingerprint based locks are not reliable, especially when accessed with damp, greasy, moisturized, gloved, or wet hands, or when the gun is dirty or dusty.
Why not an RFID gun?

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) devices operate reliably, but require a companion ring or watch, that can be stolen with the gun and prove impractical for most people. If left on a dresser, an RFID device could tempt a curious child to experiment, and may not protect the owner in a take-way situation. Wireless technologies in general are less secure.
Do you support “smart gun” mandates?

No, we are against these mandates. They are unnecessary and hinder the free market. Mandates limit the constitutional rights of citizens to buy the gun of their choice. Specifically, the smart gun mandate in New Jersey has been shown to hinder the sale and distribution of safe gun technology. Mandates backfire and diminish the citizen’s right to bear arms, while slowing safer gun developments over the past for 15 years. The Smart 2™ will stand on its own merits and should neither be mandated nor prevented from being sold.

Safety First

Commitment to Safety
 We all know how important it is to maintain a safe work environment, safety impacts every aspect of what we do.  What we accomplish, create, deliver and install would not be possible without our employees.  Our employees truly are, our most valued resource.
As a company, of course, we strive to accomplish production & delivery goals each work day.  However, we also stress safety precautions, to ensure our employees wellbeing.  Pre-cast Concrete Products of Maine, Inc., offers our employees many different resources to maintain a “safety first” work environment.

Each work morning, our employees participate in stretching exercises to keep the mind and body flexible and healthy.
Every work morning during stretches and the morning production meeting, safety topics are brought forward for open conversation amongst the crew. It is an active way for our employees to communicate together to plan for the safest route of completing their daily tasks.  Each of our employees have been trained that safety starts with them, they have a responsibility to conduct themselves in a safe working manner, and we have a responsibility to give them the tools they need in order to achieve this.
When “Near Misses” or actual “Accidents” happen, we work in a swift manner to investigate the miss or accident, and utilize information we compile, to help better train our employees on specific issues. We do this in the hopes that if an accident occurs, we can at least provide practical, positive training to reduce the risk of the same accident happening again and make our employees aware of potential hazards they may not have been aware of.
Training, training and more training! Our employees attend a “Safety Meeting” every Monday, and once a month, all of our employees participate in a “Safety Training”.
All of our production and delivery staff perform morning inspections of their work space, tools, machinery, forklifts and trucks. Faulty equipment can harm an otherwise safe employee.  We place a high priority on Lock Out-Tag Out procedures, and reporting tools and devices that are not functioning properly.
We are also aware that Health, Finances, Emotional and Physical issues can have an impact on our employee’s ability to retain a “safety” state of mind. Precast Concrete Products of Maine, Inc., proudly offers our employees a benefits package that includes Medical coverage, HSA Savings, IRA Savings, paid Holidays and at least 80 hours of paid vacation time every year.  We encourage our employees to participate in preventative health screenings and to take full advantage of the wellness programs our medical insurance provides.

Safety is a top priority!  To provide complete customer satisfaction from sales to delivered product, we need ALL of our employees here to complete their respective jobs.  We can’t afford to lose any of our valued employees due to injury.  With that said, we are grateful for the hardworking and safety minded employees that we have.  Periodically, when the team has achieved a long period of time with no accidents – we treat our staff to a “Safety Lunch”.  We do this as a token of gratitude and respect, because our staff has EARNED it.  We hope you enjoy these views of the Safety Lunch on July 2, 2015.
