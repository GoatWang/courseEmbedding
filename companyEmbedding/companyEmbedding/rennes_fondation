Home 
                                    Foundation Waterproofing Products







 Your 
                                    home is a long-term investment that requires 
                                    home foundation waterproofing products that 
                                    last as long as your home. If it fails, moisture 
                                    will have free passage through your foundation 
                                    waterproofing and any cracks or voids and 
                                    into your home. This can attract mold and 
                                    mildew, decrease the indoor air quality and 
                                    lower your homes value. It's important to 
                                    consider home foundation waterproofing products 
                                    that not only keep exterior moisture out but 
                                    also allow interior moisture to escape. 
 
What do Home Foundation 
                                    Waterproofing Products Do?

 Home foundation waterproofing 
                                    products are designed to be a barrier that 
                                    prevents water or moisture from entering your 
                                    home.   
Types of Home Foundation 
                                    Waterproofing Products

There are 2 basic types 
                                    of home foundation waterproofing products. 
                                    Spray-on home foundation waterproofing products 
                                    and polyethylene foundation waterproofing 
                                    membranes such as . 
                                    It's very important to consider which home 
                                    foundation waterproofing products to use. 
                                      
Installing Home 
                                    Foundation Waterproofing Materials
 When installing your 
                                    Residential foundation waterproofing products 
                                    consider how they work and what benefits they 
                                    offer during the normal wear and tear of your 
                                    foundation wall.

                                    of Superseals home
                                    foundation waterproofing  




 
                                    Water or solvents are carriers of an asphalt, 
                                    rubber or latex protective coating. When applying 
                                    these coatings, special equipment and sprayers 
                                    are needed. Once applied, the carriers evaporate 
                                    leaving the asphalt, rubber or latex in place 
                                    on your foundation wall. These installation 
                                    methods can be uneven or trap water and moisture 
                                    between the protective coating and the foundation 
                                    wall. If your foundation cracks after the 
                                    application of a coating, the coating may 
                                    crack with the foundation resulting in unprotected 
                                    gaps in your foundation wall and easy access 
                                    for moisture and water into your home.


 
                                    home foundation waterproofing membrane is 
                                    made of a 24-mil high-density polyethylene. 
                                    A  
                                    installation is quick and easy. You just roll 
                                    it out, fasten it to the wall, with common 
                                    tools, back fill and walk away. Its thickness 
                                    is uniform and will never be uneven or require 
                                    constant measurements with a coating thickness 
                                    gauge. It also does not trap water against 
                                    your foundation wall and provides moisture 
                                    and water with a drainage path to the footing 
                                    drain for removal.

Reading Bye Bye Foundation claims on the company website, it’s easy to think that this cosmetic is a miracle product. The manufacturer makes many claims about it, including how easily it can provide full coverage of blemishes and skin imperfections, and how it can actually heal the skin through a combination of potent moisturizers. Such claims about Bye Bye Foundation are quite stunning, and if true, would make this product a great addition to any skin care routine. However, some skin care experts point to potential flaws with this foundation from IT Cosmetics. Further, some Bye Bye Foundation reviews suggest that perhaps this product wasn’t as effective as the consumer hoped it would be, especially for the price. To better understand how this product works and what it can achieve, let’s take a closer look at Bye Bye Foundation and the manufacturer’s claims.Related: The best foundations for dry skin.About Bye Bye FoundationBye Bye Foundation is marketed by a company called IT Cosmetics. The brand was co-founded by Jamie Kern Lima, a former news anchor who suffers from rosacea and hyperpigmentation issues. According to Ms. Lima, one of the biggest challenges she faced as a newswoman was all the time she had to spend doing make-up, to cover all of her skin imperfections before tapings.Eventually, Ms. Lima decided to partner with skin care experts (like plastic surgeons and dermatologists) to start a skin care brand that could be easily used by other women to look their best. Thus, Bye Bye Foundation was developed, along with other products in the IT Cosmetics line.And our #1 recommendation in 2017 is Advanced Dermatology. Excellent. How Bye Bye Foundation WorksThe idea behind Bye Bye Foundation is to help the consumer achieve several things with just one product.Designed for individuals with hyperpigmentation and blemishes, the primary purpose of this foundation is to cover up skin imperfections. According to the manufacturer, Bye Bye Foundation achieves this with special light-reflecting pigments, which can diffuse light in a way that blurs the appearance of skin problems.In addition to creating coverage, Bye Bye Foundation is also claimed to have a number of ingredients that can boost skin health with regular use. In this way, IT Cosmetics suggests that this foundation is a cosmetic product that also heals the skin.The other main goal of Bye Bye Foundation is to protect the skin from future damage. As such, the manufacturer formulated this product with SPF 50+ protection, to neutralize harmful UV radiation which causes the development of dark spots on the face, and leads to the degeneration of collagen fibers.How to Use Bye Bye FoundationBye Bye Foundation is a cosmetic product that is meant to be applied in the morning. Before use, it’s a good idea to thoroughly cleanse the face, in order to remove dirt and oil buildup that accumulated overnight.When the skin has been cleansed, Bye Bye Foundation should be gently applied to the face and under eyes, to cover up skin imperfections and create and even skin tone. A moisturizer can be applied beforehand, for additional moisturization.Bye Bye Foundation IngredientsIn order to achieve all of the promises made by the manufacturer, Bye Bye Foundation includes quite a few ingredients that can have profoundly different purposes.For example, this foundation provides UV protection with common sunscreen ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium oxide. To achieve the moisturizing effects, this product includes chemicals like hyaluronic acid, aloe, and caprylyl glycol.In addition, Bye Bye Foundation also contains ingredients like licorice root, to brighten skin; vitamin E, to repair skin damage; and riboflavin, which may help reduce the appearance of rosacea.Because Bye Bye Foundation is often sought out by consumers with moderate to severe skin concerns, it’s highly advisable to seek the advice of a dermatologist to discuss the full ingredient list in detail, to avoid potential side effects.Where to Buy Bye Bye FoundationBye Bye Foundation can be purchased directly from the manufacturer’s website, as well as from a number of online retailers. However, because of the relatively high cost of this product (approximately $65 for a little over an ounce), it’s a good idea to read vendor reviews, to ensure that the seller is reputable. Otherwise, there is a chance of being sold an expired or counterfeit product.Bye Bye Foundation ReviewsThe reviews for Bye Bye Foundation are somewhat mixed, which can make it difficult for a consumer to make an educated decision. However, one important point is that many negative reviews for this product seem to stem from questionable practices by sellers.For example, some negative Bye Bye Foundation reviews suggest that the purchaser was enrolled into an auto-ship program when buying this product without realizing it. It’s understandable how this could cause some frustration among consumers. However, it appears that the company no longer engages in this practice – though it’s still important to read the terms and conditions carefully (including when the purchase is made through affiliate channels).Bye Bye Foundation Side EffectsDue to the large number of ingredients in Bye Bye Foundation, there is also an increased chance of side effects due to allergies and irritation. For example, some reviewers suggested that this product caused irritation and redness. Therefore, it’s important to first conduct a skin patch test on a small, discreet part of the skin, to see how your skin reacts to Bye Bye Foundation.        Tags: make up
