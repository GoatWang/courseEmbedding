Its mission then: to handle the personal investments of the two founders and their friends. Through time, that mission has expanded. Moors & Cabot manages the assets of thousands of investors from our Boston headquarters and branch offices throughout the country.

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At Moors & Cabot Inc, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Rutland, VT area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Rutland, VT); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Contact us over the web by clicking the email button, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes - we will use our expertise to your advantage.

Securities Fraud Litigation in California: For Investors
One of the most debilitating and infuriating losses one can sustain is when they have been duped or defrauded by a person in a position of fiduciary duty, namely their investment adviser or stockbroker. If you have been defrauded, or suspect that you have been defrauded, by your investment adviser, a stockbroker, or a brokerage firm, there are steps you can take to recover your losses. If you are not versed in securities fraud litigation and the relevant laws relating to securities fraud, the first step to take is to contact an experienced, qualified investment and securities fraud attorney who can recognize the telltale signs of fraud and advise you of your legal options.
Successfully Recovering Investors' Cash
At The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates, we have almost 60 years of combined experience practicing law, and 35 years of serving clients who have sustained losses due to securities fraud in California. We have successfully filed suit against some of the largest brokerage firms, investment brokers and stockbrokers and recovered millions of dollars for our clients, including Merrill Lynch, J.P. Morgan Securities, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and many others. See for yourself the list of some of our recoveries in cases that we have won for our clients in the past.
If a broker fails to properly manage your account, the brokerage fails to supervise your broker properly, your broker is guilty of negligence, recommending unsuitable securities, misrepresentation, theft, unauthorized trading, selling away, churning, or a breach of their fiduciary duty, you may have a case. We are dedicated to our clients and passionate about defending the rights of those who have been defrauded and taking action in securities litigation or arbitration. The worst thing one can do is wait to talk with a qualified securities fraud attorney when facing losses due to fraud.
Contact us today to schedule a confidential and private consultation with our attorneys.

California Securities Fraud Attorney
Investment Fraud and Securities Arbitration
At The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates, we provide experienced legal counsel to individuals, trusts, estates, and others who have suffered significant financial losses through the illegal activities of brokerage firms, financial advisors and stockbrokers. Practicing law since 1975, our founding attorney, Mr. Evans, specializes in securities arbitration matters, which is currently 95% of the practice of the firm. He limits his representation to public customers.

Why work with our firm?

Our legal team has litigated hundreds of securities arbitration claims
We have tried more than 80 cases to a conclusion at the FINRA
We have represented public individuals in mediation and with many other securities fraud matters
Attorney Evans has proudly represented hundreds of other public investors in their disputes
We have a history of success
Our objective is to assist our clients to take legal action to recover the maximum possible of their losses


Highly Knowledgeable in Security Issues
Our firm offers the highest quality, professional legal representation in securities arbitration, 
	securities mediation and 
	securities litigation. With extensive experience in 
	recognizing investment losses and identifying illegal activities through an in-depth analysis of the 
	P&L and other financial data, we can quickly ascertain if your losses are the result of 
	misconduct, 
	churning, 
	unauthorized trading, or if your investment was placed in 
	unsuitable securities, as well as cases of 
	overconcentration, 
	selling away, or 
	fraud.

Helping You Procure What Has Been Lost
If you lost significant value due to misrepresentation/omission, 
	theft/conversion, or 
	Ponzi schemes, you will require legal representation with extensive knowledge and experience to assist you to take action and protect your interests. With over 20 years of experience in 
	common claims, matters involving 
	suitability, 
	negligence, 
	breach of fiduciary duty, and 
	state securities laws, you can have confidence that your interests will be carefully protected.

We offer our services in cases of significant losses in:

Annuities
Reverse convertibles
REITs
TICs
Principal protected notes
Stocks
Bonds
Mutual funds
UITs

Whether your portfolio losses are related to structured products, 
	promissory notes, 
	private placements, 
	limited partnerships, or 
	options, we have the experience and depth of experience necessary to seek justice and recovery of losses through arbitration or in court.

One of the most common defenses asserted by the securities industry is that damages are limited to Net-Out-of-Pocket losses. This NOP Myth can be defeated only by careful claims analysis, pleading specific causes of actions, and presenting detailed damages models. Our lengthy experience in securities arbitration provides clients with opportunities to defeat the NOP Myth and recover a proper measure of damages."
Persistent and Passionate Legal Assistance - Call 888-527-3427!
These are complex issues that are usually heavily contested by corporate securities law defense attorneys representing the investment firm, brokerage, financial advisor or broker. It is necessary that you have an equally experienced California securities attorney with a record of success in arbitration, mediation, and at trial to represent you and protect your interests. We urge you to contact our firm to discuss your situation, and we can advise you as to the best course of legal action, based upon the circumstances of your case and the financial losses involved.

Securities Law Attorney
For over three decades, The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates have been providing skilled and dedicated legal representation to public investors. Your investment broker or firm has a legally enforceable responsibility to act solely on your benefit when investing your money and providing financial services to you. If they have acted improperly, you have legal recourse, which we can provide. We provide services to our clients in the following areas:
Securities Arbitration: Our practice specializes in securities arbitration matters. We have litigated hundreds of securities arbitration claims and have also tried more than fifty (50) cases to conclusion at the NASD. Arbitration decisions are legally binding and normally avoid lengthy and costly litigation.
Securities Mediation: Mediation is another alternative to securities litigation. A neutral third party will work with the disputing parties and attempt to help them reach agreement. Unlike arbitration, the final settlement reached through mediation is not legally binding.
Securities Litigation: It is normally recommended that resolution be reached through arbitration or mediation. This is not always possible, and sometimes is not what is best for the investor. Litigation can also be used in combination with the alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
Types of Cases We Handle
Negligence:

	These are losses due to the negligent failure to follow express instructions given to a broker as well as the negligent failure of a broker’s firm to properly supervise the broker’s activities. Negligence may also include a broker’s failure to recommend investments which are consistent with a customer’s stated investment objectives and a customer’s risk tolerance.
	

Suitability:

	These are losses resulting from investments and investment vehicles, including stocks, annuities, bonds, and options which were unsuitable based upon a client’s risk profile and/or investment objectives, even if the customer ratified or otherwise acquiesced to the broker’s “suggestion” that he/she make the investment.
	

Failure to Supervise the Activity of a Customer Account:

	A brokerage firm has an affirmative duty to formulate and implement layers of supervision to assure that a customer’s account is being monitored to prevent wrongful and sometimes abusive conduct which could result in customer losses. If trading in a client’s account is inappropriate in light of the customer’s stated investment objectives and level of risk tolerance, proper supervision should identify any “red flags” in a timely fashion, and intervention by a supervisor should protect the customer against losses that flow from the unsuitable trading.
	

Failure of the Brokerage Firm to Adequately Supervise the Broker:

	Brokerage firms must also formulate and implement systems of supervision over its individual brokers. This includes closely monitoring the broker’s trading patterns across the broker’s entire “book of business”, usually on a daily basis. If brokers’ supervisors negligently or intentionally choose to “look the other way”, notwithstanding obvious “red flags”, the brokerage firm may be held liable for the customer’s losses.
	

Breach of Fiduciary Duty:

	In California, as a matter of law, a broker owes clients a fiduciary duty in the discharge of his duties. This means a broker owes the “highest” duty of loyalty and “highest” duty to always act in a manner consistent with the client’s best interest ahead of his own. Therefore the conduct of a broker is subject to heightened scrutiny insofar as how a recommendation to a customer might benefit the broker.
	

Misrepresentation and Fraud:

	When recommending or soliciting the purchase or sale of an investment, a broker is obligated to make a full disclosure of all material facts including, but not limited to, any risk of loss of principal, all fees and costs associated with the investment product (including commissions), the existence and availability of other similar investments, and any other material disclosures which might reasonably impact the customer’s decision to invest his/her funds.
	

Overconcentration and Lack of Diversification:

	Brokers have a duty to recommend a diversified portfolio. Diversification manages and limits investment risk. Investing a disproportionately large portion of a client’s portfolio in a single market sector (i.e. all technology or telecommunication stocks), a single investment vehicle (i.e. all stocks or annuities and no bonds or fixed income securities), or a single asset class (i.e. all funds invested in growth equity mutual funds and little or none in fixed income funds), creates unacceptable “concentration risk.”
	

Churning of an Account:

	Churning is excessive trading or turnover of an account in order to generate broker commissions. This may also include unjustified mutual fund switching or so-called IRC Section 1035 switching of variable annuities.

Frequently Asked Questions
Answers to Common Securities Fraud Concerns
When you give your money to a broker or investor, that individual is bound by a fiduciary duty, which means that he has an obligation to act for your benefit. As we have seen from the headlines in recent years, a fair amount of corruption has plagued the securities industry and investment world.
If you have concerns about your investments, look through the frequently asked questions and answers provided below and then call an experienced lawyer at The Law Offices of Jonathan W. Evans & Associates. Our firm limits our representation to public customers and since 1975 we have been helping public investors to successfully resolve their arbitration claims and investor disputes.
What are the signs of securities fraud?
There are actually many signs and we will give a few here. Unsolicited investment offers from strangers is probably the first sign. You may have had trusted friends "rave" about high returns in a short period of time. Promises of high returns in short time periods, even when recommended by a trusted friend is a red flag. High-pressure sales pitches are high-risk signs that you should definitely avoid completely. If your broker is unwilling to take the time to properly and adequately inform you about investments, he is not doing his job. There are many other signs. If you are worried, call us.
How do I find someone I can trust to handle my investments?
This is an excellent question, but a challenge to answer. Based on news that some of the largest and most trusted firms have been quite corrupt, it may seem impossible to determine. The best answer is, do your homework. Take your time, ask lots of questions. Look at their Internet presence. Talk to several brokers, hopefully based on referrals from trusted friends or family members. Do not be afraid to ask any question, no matter how simple it may seem. Note how you are responded to. Trust your instincts. Do not trust the hype.
What is the difference between mediation and arbitration?
Both securities mediation and 
	securities arbitration are used as an alternative to litigation when resolving disputes. An unbiased, third party is used in both. The arbitrator will make a final decision after reviewing the case and listening to both parties' arguments. The final decision in arbitration is legally binding. The mediator discusses possible solutions with the parties and encourages them to resolve the conflict on their own.

What is your best option in California?
To get all of your questions answered, we recommend that you speak with us at your earliest convenience. We provide trusted legal representation and have been doing so for over three decades. You can feel confident that we can provide you with the information you need to determine your best course of action.
