Consensus Ratings for Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico S.A. B. de C.V. (NYSE:BSMX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $7.80 (24.20% downside)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We face strong domestic competition in all aspects of our business from other 
Mexican financial groups, commercial banks, insurance companies and securities 
brokerage houses, as well as from non-Mexican banks and international financial
institutions. Banco Santander Mexico competes for both commercial and retail 
customers with other large Mexican banks, including subsidiaries of foreign 
banks, which, like Banco Santander Mexico, are a part of financial groups. In 
some parts of Mexico, Banco Santander Mexico also competes with regional banks.
Banco Santander Mexico also competes with certain non-Mexican banks 
(principally those based in the United States and Spain) for the business of 
the largest Mexican industrial groups and government entities, as well as high 
net worth individuals. 

Banco Santander Mexico’s principal competitors are BBVA Bancomer, S.A., 
Institución de Banca Múltiple, Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer; Banco Nacional 
de México, S.A., Integrante del Grupo Financiero Banamex, which is part of 
Citigroup; Banco Mercantil del Norte, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, 
Grupo Financiero Banorte; HSBC México, S.A., Institución de Banca Múltiple, 
Grupo Financiero HSBC; Banco Inbursa, S.A., Institución de Banca Multiple, 
Grupo Financiero Inbursa; and Scotiabank Inverlat, S.A., Institución de Banca 
Múltiple, Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat. Some of the banks with which 
Banco Santander Mexico competes are significantly larger and have more 
financial resources than Santander Mexico, including a larger asset size and 
capital base. 

The following table shows the rankings and market share of Banco Santander 
Mexico and Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico among the seven largest private 
banks and seven largest private financial groups in terms of total assets in

     Scotiabank.  

(2)  Among the seven largest private financial groups in Mexico in terms of 
     total assets: Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico, Grupo Financiero BBVA 
     Bancomer, Grupo Financiero Banamex, Grupo Financiero Banorte, Grupo 
     Financiero HSBC, Grupo Financiero Inbursa and Grupo Financiero Scotiabank.

(3)  We calculate market share based on information published by the CNBV.  

(4)  Defined as total non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans.  

(5)  We calculate the efficiency ratio as administrative expenses divided by 
     total income, using information published by the CNBV.  

(6)  We calculate ROAE based on annualized net income for June 30, 2012, and we
     have used an average of shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2011 and 
     June 30, 2012.  

Our prestige and leadership has been recognized in the Mexican financial 
system, as well as in the broader Mexican business community. Also in 2011, 
América Economía ranked Banco Santander Mexico as the sixth overall best bank 
in Latin America and the first in Mexico, and Global Finance recognized 
Santander as the safest bank in Mexico, in each case based on criteria defined 
in the respective publications. In 2010 and 2012, Euromoney named Banco 
Santander Mexico the overall best bank in Mexico, and in 2012, Euromoney also 
recognized our private banking unit as the best in the “super affluent” 
category, defined as clients worth between U.S.$500,000 and U.S.$1.0 million. 

The banking sector in Mexico can be classified into two groups: the mature, 
established “large banks” and the recently created “new banks.” As of December 
31, 2011, the four largest banks, BBVA Bancomer, Banamex, Banorte and Banco 
Santander Mexico, held in the aggregate 68.4% of the total deposits in Mexico, 
followed by a total of 19.9% held in the aggregate by HSBC, Scotiabank and 
Inbursa, all of which are established large banks. The remaining 11.7% was 
distributed among 35 other banks. 

We also compete with credit unions in Mexico. Credit unions are financial 
institutions that are formed for the purpose of providing access to funding 
and favorable conditions for savings and receipt of loans and financial 
services. Credit unions do not provide services to the public in general, since
they are only authorized to carry out transactions with their members. The 
operation of a credit union is carried out by its own members. In order to be 
a member of a credit union, one must comply with the eligibility requirements 
established for that organization and acquire a certain number of shares of 
the credit union. 

The deposits of members with a credit union are not subject to any form of 
deposit insurance. There are credit unions for many different economic groups,
ranging from fishermen to industrialists, but there are also “mixed” credit 
unions that accept members who perform different economic activities and 
“social sector” credit unions that serve economic sectors that are unable to 
access traditional financial institutions due to social, economic and 
geographic conditions. 

Commercial banks in Mexico also compete in the retail market with non-banking 
institutions known as Sofoles and Sofomes, which focus primarily on offering 
consumer, commercial and mortgage loans to middle- and low-income individuals.
Until recently, the commercial credit market for middle- and low- income 
individual customers has been serviced almost exclusively by non-banking 
institutions. Currently, more than 50 non-banking institutions are licensed to 
operate in Mexico. Mexican non-banking institutions may engage in certain 
specific lending activities, but are prohibited from engaging in many banking 
operations, including receiving deposits, foreign trade financing, offering 
current accounts and engaging in foreign currency operations. Traditional banks
have begun to extend their credit services to the markets previously dominated 
by Sofoles and Sofomes. 

At the beginning of 2008, the Mexican Banking Law (Ley de Instituciones de 
Crédito) was modified to, among other things, grant authority to the CNBV (with
the assistance of other regulators, but having primary responsibility) to 
authorize the creation of banks solely to engage in certain activities (which 
is intended to incentivize competition, reduce required capital considering 
their risk exposure and improve the attention to certain industries and 
regions) as compared to so-called “universal” banks, such as Banco Santander 
Mexico. As a result of the reduced capital requirements and potential reduced 
operational costs that are likely to apply to this type of bank, there could be
increased competition as a result of the creation of more banks to target 
specific market niches. To the best of our knowledge, as of December 31, 2011, 
the CNBV has not granted any authorization for the creation of this kind of 
limited operation bank. 

In addition, commercial banks will probably face increasing competition from 
Sofoles and Sofomes as a result of reforms to several financial laws, which 
have been enacted with the main purpose of deregulating lending activities in 
Mexico, including financial leasing and factoring activities. 

Commercial banks also face increasing competition from securities firms and 
other financial intermediaries that can provide larger companies with access to
domestic and international capital markets as an alternative to bank loans. 

In the brokerage services sector, Casa de Bolsa Santander, our broker-dealer 
subsidiary, competes with 34 other brokerage houses, 18 of which are part of a 
financial group and the rest of which are independent. As of December 31, 2011,
Casa de Bolsa Santander ranked in sixth place in terms of amount traded on the 
Mexican Stock Exchange with a share of 6.38%.


Company Description
We are the second largest financial services holding company in Mexico based on
net income and the fourth largest financial services holding company in Mexico 
based on total assets, loans and deposits as of June 30, 2012, in each case as 
determined in accordance with Mexican Banking GAAP,


 according to information 
published by the Mexican National Banking and Securities Commission ( Comisión 
Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, or CNBV). Through our bank and other 
subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of financial and related services, 
principally in Mexico, including retail and commercial banking, securities 
underwriting and brokerage and custody services, and asset management. Our 
principal subsidiaries are Banco Santander Mexico, our commercial bank 
subsidiary, Casa de Bolsa Santander, our brokerage subsidiary, and Gestión 
Santander, our asset management subsidiary. As of June 30, 2012, we had total 
assets of Ps.837.1 billion (U.S.$62.4 billion) and shareholders’ equity of 
Ps.97.7 billion (U.S.$7.3 billion), and for the six months ended June 30, 2012,
we had net income of Ps.9.4 billion (U.S.$0.7 billion), which represented a 
return on average shareholders’ equity, or ROAE, of 19.9% for that period. Our 
most significant subsidiary is Banco Santander Mexico, which as of June 30, 
2012 accounted for 99.8% of our total assets and 101.1% of our shareholders’ 
equity, and for the six months ended June 30, 2012 accounted for 98.0% of our 
net income. As of June 30, 2012, Banco Santander Mexico had total loans net of 
allowance outstanding of Ps.338.0 billion (U.S.$25.2 billion), total deposits 
of Ps.489.1 billion (U.S.$36.5 billion) and 1,097 branches located throughout 
Mexico. 

We offer a differentiated financial services platform in Mexico focused on the 
client segments that we believe are most profitable, such as high- and mid-
income individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, while also 
providing integrated financial services to low-income individuals, as well as 
to medium and large companies in Mexico. We began to implement our client 
segmentation strategy in 2008 through the development of our information 
technology systems, product offerings, distribution channels and internal 
practices.

operating segments of the Bank and their main focus.

Banco Santander, S.A., or Banco Santander Spain, is our controlling shareholder
and owns, directly or indirectly, 99.9% of our total capital stock. We believe 
that our relationship with Banco Santander Spain and the Santander Group as a 
whole offers us significant competitive advantages over other financial 
services holding companies in Mexico. As of June 30, 2012, the Santander Group 
had total assets of €1,292,677 million (U.S.$1,626,191 million), shareholders’ 
equity of €81,821 million (U.S.$102,931 million) and a market capitalization of
€49,261 million (U.S.$61,970 million). It also generated an attributable profit
of €1,704 million (U.S.$2,144 million) in the six months ended June 30, 2012. 
We represented approximately 12% of the Santander Group’s attributable profit 
in the six months ended June 30, 2012, making us the third largest contributor 
of attributable profits to the Santander Group. We also represented 
approximately 4% of the Santander Group’s assets in the six months ended June 
30, 2012. 

In Latin America, the Santander Group was one of the overall largest banking 
groups in terms of assets as of December 31, 2011, based on publicly available 
annual reports. The Santander Group had 5,991 branches, 90,622 employees and an
attributable profit of €2,240 million (U.S.$2,818 million) for the six months 
ended June 30, 2012, according to the interim report of the Santander Group for
the first half of 2012.
