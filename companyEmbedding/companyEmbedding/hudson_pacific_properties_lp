(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us or our representatives in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other filings or reports filed with the SEC, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as amended, and  Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:   adverse economic or real estate developments in our target markets;   general economic conditions;   defaults on, early terminations of or non-renewal of leases by tenants;   fluctuations in interest rates and increased operating costs;   our failure to obtain necessary outside financing or maintain an investment grade rating;   our failure to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness and maintain dividend payments;   lack or insufficient amounts of insurance;   decreased rental rates or increased vacancy rates;   difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;   our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;   our failure to maintain our status as a REIT;   environmental uncertainties and risks related to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;   financial market fluctuations;   risks related to acquisitions generally, including the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business operations and the impact on customers, tenants, lenders, operating results and business; the inability to successfully integrate acquired properties, realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or capitalize on value creation opportunities;   changes in real estate and zoning laws and increases in real property tax rates; and   other factors affecting the real estate industry generally.  Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Historical Results of Operations  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. for the three months ended March 31, 2017 represents an update to the more detailed and comprehensive disclosures included in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. Accordingly, you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the information included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the unaudited financial statements included in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In addition, some of the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act or Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry growth for the first quarter and beyond. See "Forward-Looking Statements."

All amounts and percentages used in this discussion of our results of operations are calculated using the numbers presented in the financial statements contained in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report rather than the rounded numbers appearing in this discussion. The dollar amounts included in the tables in this discussion of our results of operations are presented in thousands.  Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the three months ended March 31, 2016  Net Operating Income  We evaluate performance based upon property net operating income ("NOI") from continuing operations. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities or cash flows as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations, as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. All companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. We calculate NOI as net income (loss) excluding corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gains/losses on sales of real estate, interest expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI on a cash basis is NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to revenue and expenses.  Management further analyzes NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups:   Same-Store Properties-which includes all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1, 2016 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of March 31, 2017; Non-Same-Store properties, development projects, redevelopment properties and lease-up properties as of March 31, 2017 and other properties not owned or not in operation from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017.  The following table reconciles net income to NOI:   Three Months Ended March 31, Percentage 2017 2016 Dollar Change Change Net income $ 24,153 $ 5,976 $ 18,177 304.2 % Adjustments: Interest expense 21,930 17,251 4,679 27.1 Interest income (30 ) (13 ) (17 ) 130.8 Unrealized (gain) loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments (6 ) 2,125 (2,131 ) 100.3 Other (income) expense (678 ) 24 (702 ) 2,925.0 Gains on sale of real estate (16,866 ) (6,352 ) (10,514 ) 165.5 Income from operations 28,503 19,011 9,492 49.9 Adjustments: General and administrative 13,810 12,503 1,307 10.5 Depreciation and amortization 70,767 68,368 2,399 3.5 NOI $ 113,080 $ 99,882 $ 13,198 13.2 % Same-Store NOI $ 76,195 $ 73,577 $ 2,618 3.6 % Non-Same-Store NOI 36,885 26,305 10,580 40.2 NOI $ 113,080 $ 99,882 $ 13,198 13.2 %  The following table summarizes certain statistics of our Same-Store office and media and entertainment properties:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Same-Store office statistics: Number of properties 34 34 Rentable square feet 8,336,019 8,336,019 Ending % leased 96.3 % 95.9 % Ending % occupied 95.8 % 94.4 % Average % occupied for the period 95.6 % 93.6 % Average annual rental rate per square foot $ 40.24 $ 38.93 Same-Store media and entertainment statistics: Number of properties 2 2 Rentable square feet 879,652 879,652 Average % occupied for the period 90.3 % 81.6 %  The following table gives further detail on our NOI:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Same-Store Non-Same-Store Total Same-Store Non-Same-Store Total Revenues Office Rental $ 81,972 $ 51,544 $ 133,516 $ 78,513 $ 37,714 $ 116,227 Tenant recoveries 12,930 4,471 17,401 16,892 3,641 20,533 Parking and other 4,040 1,859 5,899 4,089 1,443 5,532 Total office revenues 98,942 57,874 156,816 99,494 42,798 142,292 Media & Entertainment Rental 6,685 - 6,685 6,028 - 6,028 Tenant recoveries 665 - 665 199 - 199 Other property-related revenue 4,042 - 4,042 4,969 - 4,969 Other 77 - 77 49 - 49 Total Media & Entertainment revenues 11,469 - 11,469 11,245 - 11,245 Total revenues 110,411 57,874 168,285 110,739 42,798 153,537 Operating Expenses Office operating expenses 26,965 20,989 47,954 31,210 16,493 47,703 Media & Entertainment operating expenses 7,251 - 7,251 5,952 - 5,952 Total operating expenses 34,216 20,989 55,205 37,162 16,493 53,655 Office NOI 71,977 36,885 108,862 68,284 26,305 94,589 Media & Entertainment NOI 4,218 - 4,218 5,293 - 5,293 NOI $ 76,195 $ 36,885 $ 113,080 $ 73,577 $ 26,305 $ 99,882  The following table gives further detail on our change to NOI:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 as compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Same-Store Non-Same-Store Total Dollar Change Percent Change Dollar Change Percent Change Dollar Change Percent Change Revenues Office Rental $ 3,459 4.4 % $ 13,830 36.7 % $ 17,289 14.9 % Tenant recoveries (3,962 ) (23.5 ) 830 22.8 (3,132 ) (15.3 ) Parking and other (49 ) (1.2 ) 416 28.8 367 6.6 Total office revenues (552 ) (0.6 ) 15,076 35.2 14,524 10.2 Media & Entertainment Rental 657 10.9 - - 657 10.9 Tenant recoveries 466 234.2 - - 466 234.2 Other property-related revenue (927 ) (18.7 ) - - (927 ) (18.7 ) Other 28 57.1 - - 28 57.1 Total Media & Entertainment revenues 224 2.0 - - 224 2.0 Total revenues (328 ) (0.3 ) 15,076 35.2 14,748 9.6 Operating expenses Office operating expenses (4,245 ) (13.6 ) 4,496 27.3 251 0.5 Media & Entertainment operating expenses 1,299 21.8 - - 1,299 21.8 Total operating expenses (2,946 ) (7.9 ) 4,496 27.3 1,550 2.9 Office NOI 3,693 5.4 10,580 40.2 14,273 15.1 Media & Entertainment NOI (1,075 ) (20.3 ) - - (1,075 ) (20.3 ) NOI $ 2,618 3.6 % $ 10,580 40.2 % $ 13,198 13.2 %  NOI increased $13.2 million, or 13.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily resulting from:   A $3.7 million, or 5.4%, increase in NOI from our Same-Store office properties resulting primarily from increased rental income relating to leases signed at our 1455 Market Street (Uber Technologies, Inc. and Vevo), 625 Second Street (Github and Blue Jeans) and Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm) properties at a higher rate than expiring leases, partially offset by a reduction in rental income at our Towers at Shore Center property due to a lease renewal at market rates lower than expiring rates. In addition, the increase was partially offset by tenant recoveries and tax adjustments relating to the prior year for our Rincon Center, Clocktower Square and 1455 Market Street properties.   A $10.6 million, or 40.2%, increase in NOI from our Non-Same-Store office store properties resulting primarily from increased rental income relating to the commencement of Netflix's lease at our Icon property, higher rents and occupancy at our Metro Center (Qualys, Inc. and BrightEdge) property and a number of acquisitions in 2016, which include 11601 Wilshire (acquired July 2016), Hill7 (acquired October 2016) and Page Mill Hill (acquired December 2016 (collectively "2016 Acquisitions"), partially offset by the sale of our Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016), One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) and 222 Kearny Street (sold in February 2017) properties.   A $1.1 million, or 20.3%, decrease in NOI from our Same-Store media and entertainment properties resulting primarily from lower other property-related revenues and higher operating expenses. The decrease was driven by unusually high production activity by a stage user in the first quarter of 2016, which normalized in the most recently completed quarter, as well as the use by Netflix of a stage for storage purposes in connection with its move into Icon over the most recent quarter. Additionally, the increase in operating expense was largely due to higher occupancy and expense savings associated with a property tax reassessment in 2016. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in rental revenues resulting primarily from higher occupancy and an increase in tenant recoveries largely stemmed from higher recoveries for current and prior year expenses attributable to KTLA at Sunset Bronson Studios.  Office NOI  Same-Store  Same-Store office rental revenue increased $3.5 million, or 4.4%, to $82.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $78.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to leases signed at our 1455 Market Street (Uber Technologies, Inc and Vevo), 625 Second Street (Github and Blue Jeans) and Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm) properties at a . . .

Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. Enters New Term Loan Credit Agreement with Financial Institutions
Nov 20 15
Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) entered into a new term loan credit agreement with each of the financial institutions party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, as lead arrangers for the 5-Year Term Loan Facility, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and U.S. Bank National Association, as lead arrangers for the 7-Year Term Loan Facility, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent for the 5-Year Term Loan Facility, U.S. Bank National Association, as syndication agent for the 7-Year Term Loan Facility, and MUFG Union Bank N.A., as documentation agent with respect to the 5-Year Term Loan Facility. The New Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $175 million (the 5-Year Term Loan Facility) and an unsecured 7-year delayed draw term loan credit facility in the amount of up to $125 million (the 7-Year Term Loan Facility). The Operating Partnership intends to use the amounts available under the 5-Year Term Loan Facility and the 7-Year Term Loan Facility to repay outstanding borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Operating Partnership is the borrower and Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. is the guarantor under the New Credit Agreement. If the company fails to maintain a credit rating of at least BBB- from S&P or Baa3 from Moody's, or in certain other limited circumstances, the subsidiaries of the Company that own unencumbered properties will also be required to become guarantors under the New Credit Agreement. For borrowings under the 5-Year Term Loan Facility, the Operating Partnership may elect to pay interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus 130 basis points to 220 basis points per annum or a specified base rate plus 30 basis points to 120 basis points per annum, depending on the company's leverage ratio. For borrowings under the 7-Year Term Loan Facility, the Operating Partnership may elect to pay interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus 160 basis points to 255 basis points per annum or a specified base rate plus 60 basis points to 155 basis points per annum, depending on the company's leverage ratio.

This
Current Report on Form 8-K is filed by Hudson Pacific Properties,
Inc. (the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, and
Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. (the “Operating
Partnership”), a Maryland limited partnership of which the
Company serves as the sole general partner.  

Item 8.01.
Other Events.

On
November 28, 2016, the Company and certain funds affiliated with
Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. (the “Selling
Stockholders” or the “Farallon Funds”) completed
an underwritten public offering of 18,699,017 shares of common
stock of the Company, $0.01 par value per share (the “Common
Stock”), consisting of 17,533,099 shares offered by the
Company and 1,165,918 shares offered by the Selling Stockholders.
The offering generated net proceeds for the Company and the Selling
Stockholders of approximately $569.8 million and $37.9 million,
respectively, before expenses. The Company did not receive any
proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock by the Selling
Stockholders but will pay approximately half of the expenses of the
offering with respect to the shares of Common Stock sold by the
Selling Stockholders, other than underwriting discounts, which will
be borne by the Selling Stockholders.

In
connection with the offering, the Company entered into an
underwriting agreement, dated November 21, 2016 (the
“Underwriting Agreement”), among the Company, the
Operating Partnership, the Selling Stockholders and Morgan Stanley
& Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”). The Underwriting
Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the
parties, and indemnification and contribution provisions under
which the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling
Stockholders have agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Pursuant to
the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, not to sell or transfer any shares of Common
Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for Common Stock for 30 days after November 21, 2016
without first obtaining the written consent of the Underwriter. A
copy of the Underwriting Agreement is attached as Exhibit 1.1
to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by
reference.

The
offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) on March 16, 2015 (File No. 333-202799), a base
prospectus, dated March 16, 2015, included as part of the
registration statement, and a prospectus supplement, dated November
21, 2016, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act. We are filing as Exhibit 5.1 to this Current Report
on Form 8-K an opinion of our counsel, Venable LLP, regarding
certain Maryland law issues concerning the shares of Common Stock
sold in the offering.

On
November 28, 2016, the Company used the net proceeds of the
offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, but before
estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, to acquire an
aggregate of 17,250,000 common units of partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership (the “Common Units”) from certain
entities affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and 283,099
Common Units from the Farallon Funds.

the requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations of
the Commission under the 1934 Act (the “ 1934 Act

Package or the Prospectus, or incorporated by reference therein,
regarding “non-GAAP financial measures” (as such term
is defined by the rules and regulations of the Commission) comply
in all material respects with Regulation G of the 1934 Act and

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, no
Transaction Entity has incurred or expects to incur liability under
(i) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or
withdrawal from, any “pension plan” or
(ii) Sections 412 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “ Code ”); each
“pension plan” for which any Transaction Entity would
have any liability that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all material
respects and nothing has occurred thereunder, whether by action or
by failure to act, which would cause the loss of such

disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules
and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its principal executive
officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, as

otherwise due and payable have been paid, except taxes and

taken and as to which adequate reserves have been provided. The
Company and its subsidiaries have filed in a timely manner all tax
returns that are required to have been filed by them pursuant to
applicable foreign, state, local or other law (other than United
States federal income tax law), except insofar as the failure to

and all such tax returns are correct and complete in all material
respects. The Company and its subsidiaries have paid all material

its existing insurance coverage as and when such policies expire or
(B) to obtain comparable coverage from similar institutions as
may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as now
conducted and at a cost that would not result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither of the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been
denied any insurance coverage that it has sought or for which it
has applied. The Transaction Entities, directly or indirectly, have

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
