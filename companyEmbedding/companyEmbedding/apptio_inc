I’ve been through five startups in my career and Apptio is by far the most exciting and promising one of the bunch. From the people to the technology to the market opportunity, everything is top notch. From a technical standpoint, the work is very challenging and demanding, yet we pay more than lip service to work/life balance

I joined Apptio a year ago where we were less than 150 employees. I have been enjoying being part of the growth and success of Apptio. I feel like we are a family animated by the same passion. In a year I was able to evolve into a new position with more management. Apptio gave me the opportunity to challenge myself and to always want to do better always with a smile! So if I have to describe Apptio I would say: great work environment, great people (including leadership), and opportunities to grow and be part of something big!

I could see we’d need better insight into the cost of all the things we were doing in order to really leverage acquisitions and grow this business. I couldn’t chase people at the end of every month to make sure that the numbers fit. The transparency we’ve put in place with Apptio allows me and the CFO to have a lot more confidence in the numbers.

The company was founded in 2007 by Sunny Gupta, Kurt Shintaffer and Paul McLachlan.[13] Prior to founding the company, Gupta and Shintaffer worked together at iConclude before it was purchased by Opsware in 2007.[9] In November 2007, the company received $7 million in funding from Madrona Venture Group and Greylock partners while it was operating in stealth mode.[14] Apptio raised an additional $14 million dollars in Series B funding from the newly formed Andersson Horrowitz fund in 2009.[6] In 2010, the company raised an additional $16.5 million in Series C funding led by Shasta Ventures, with participation from previous investors.[15] In March 2012, the company raised an additional $50 million in Series D funding to continue scaling, hiring and expanding its services.[16] In 2013, Apptio raised an additional $45 million in Series E funding, bringing its total raised to $136 million from firms including Greylock Partners, Madrona Venture Group, Janus Capital and T. Rowe Price.[4][11]
In March 2014, Apptio opened offices in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia.[17] In 2015, the company announced that it was adding an office in Denver.[18] Apptio added another international office in March 2016, when it announced it would open an office in Paris, France.[19]
On September 23, 2016, Apptio raised $96 million with its IPO.[3]

Apptio founded the Technology Business Management Council in 2012,[20] a non-profit organization that had over 2,900 CIOs[21] and other senior IT leaders by 2014.[20] It was reported by the Puget Sound Business Journal that the council “aims to help IT departments run like businesses by setting standards and best practices” .[22] The council held its first conference in November 2013.[12]
Awards and recognition[edit]
