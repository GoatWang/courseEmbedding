Carmex Everyday Lip Care | How to Get Healthy & Moisturized Lips



































































Everyday Lip Care
There are steps you can take to give your lips the care and protection they deserve to keep them healthy. It starts with finding the Carmex® lip balm that’s right for you. Check out the information below.
For more details about lip surfaces, texture, flexibility, color and contour, click here to download The Little Lip Book.

					What are “healthy” lips?				


The function of all surface tissues on the body, including the lips, is to protect the body from the outside environment. Such protection can only be accomplished if the lips are healthy. Healthy lips let us smile, whistle and kiss without discomfort, while protecting us from the harmful effects of the sun and wind.
So how do you get healthy lips? As the most delicate part of the face, lips have no oil glands of their own, so sometimes they need external moisture to keep them soft and healthy. That’s where Carmex® comes in.

					What can I do for dry, chapped lips?				


It’s the problem that plagues just about everybody: tender, dry lips that start cracking and rapidly get worse. The most common chapped lip causes are excessive lip licking, dehydration and damage from the sun.
Every time you lick your lips, it removes natural oils that keep moisture in your skin. In turn, that moisture evaporates, leaving behind dried-out, cracked lips with nothing to protect them.
Dehydration can happen when you spend too much time in dry environments (air conditioning and heating systems are culprits here), if you breathe through your mouth at night, and if you’re not drinking that all-important daily amount of water. In all cases, lip moisturizer can mean the difference between miserable lips and a huge smile.
Try Carmex® Classic Lip Balm for dry, chapped lips.

					How can I protect my lips from sun damage?				


Sun damage can lead to skin losing some of its elasticity, and unprotected lips are no exception. If you do not protect your lips from the sun you are increasing the risk of skin cancer or other undesirable skin conditions. However, you can protect your lips from sun damage by using a Carmex® lip balm with sunscreen designed specifically for the lips. Try and avoid glossy lip balms and lip sticks, which can actually magnify the sun’s rays.
Use your lip balm every day, even when it is cloudy because the sun’s rays can get through a cloudy sky. It is recommended to keep an SPF 15 or higher lip balm on hand and reapply it every two hours, including after eating or drinking. 
To keep your lips looking and feeling healthy, keep lips moisturized. When outdoors, use SPF 15 lip balm and avoid excessive exposure to the sun. Since sun damage happens over time, it’s never too late to start a good habit of making sure your lips are protected from the sun.
For sun-protecting lip balm, try Carmex Daily Care™.

					Should my lip care change each season?				


Many people have a daily skin care routine for their face, but forget about caring for their lips. The skin on our lips is softer, more sensitive and prone to damage when exposed to external elements. Since lips do not produce oil, they need extra care to stay hydrated.
During the summer, we tend to spend more time outdoors, exposing our lips to dryness, sunburn and sun damage due to heat and UV rays. During the winter, lip care can be even harder to maintain, as lips often bear the brunt of the elements, both indoors and out. Centrally heated homes and offices (which can be particularly dry) and whipping winter winds can take a toll on lips. UV rays can still do damage, even in the cold of winter.
So how can you help your lips weather the seasons? Here are 7 basic summer and winter lip care tips that can be applied year-round:

Do not lick your lips! Saliva draws moisture out of the lips as it evaporates and only makes the problem worse.
Drink plenty of fluids—especially water—and stay hydrated.
Use moisturizing lip balms that will seal in moisture and stay on your lips to help keep your lips hydrated. If you are not allergic to sunscreen, use a product with SPF 15 or higher—not just on sunny days, but every day.
Lipsticks that are shiny or contain high gloss with little-to-no color can be potentially harmful to lips because they can attract UV rays. Try a triple-layer approach for added protection: apply a lip balm with SPF, followed by a colored lipstick, then finish it off with some shine.
Use equal parts brown sugar, water, salt and honey to exfoliate your lips and remove any chapped skin.
Cover your face. In the winter, especially on windy days, make sure you have a scarf or hat with a mask that covers your lips.
Use a humidifier in dry environments to help moisturize your skin and lips.

Try Classic Lip Balm in the winter and Sun-Protecting Lip Balm in the summer.

					Can I wear lipstick and lip balm?				


Lipstick should show off your lips—NOT highlight dryness, cracking or chapping. Here are 4 quick beauty tips for your lips so you can get the most flattering and long-lasting look from your favorite lipstick:

Exfoliate lips once or twice a week to keep them soft and supple.
This step removes all of the dead skin from your lips, leaving new skin cells to grow in their place. This can easily be done by combining equal parts brown sugar, water, salt and honey, and then gently scrubbing the mixture on your lips.
Apply a moisture-locking lip balm before any other lip product to keep lips smooth and hydrated.
Lipstick can accentuate every flake and crack if lips are dry and chapped. As added protection against dryness, it’s a good idea to also apply medicated lip balm to lips before bed each night to keep lips moisturized.
Apply lip liner.
Begin at the dip of the upper lip and trace the outer part of your lips. Once the lips are lined, use the same liner pencil to fill them in. Simply turn the liner onto its side and color in the rest of the lip. This step is important, as it will provide a foundation for the lipstick you apply on top.
Apply lipstick.
Now it’s time to apply lipstick. One of the things that will help your lipstick look its best is to apply it with a lip brush, instead of directly from the tube, to allow the color to get into the lip and stay longer. Dip the brush onto the lipstick, and pack the color onto the lips to get a sort of stained effect. Next, take a tissue and blot the lips a couple of times to press the color into your lips. Then, use the lipstick tube to apply the second coat of color.

(Not all ingredients are found in every product.)





Natural Ingredients
Ingredients for Relief and Comfort
Ingredients for Moisturization and Protection






					Natural Ingredients				


Aloe: Plant-derived extract that helps heal and soothe.
Aloe has been used for centuries to treat skin conditions as well as wounds. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, aloe relieves the pain of dry and chapped lips and skin. Another benefit of aloe is the hydrating effect that helps give a more youthful appearance wherever it’s applied.
Avocado Butter: Provides super moisturizing benefits.
Avocados have been used for health and beauty benefits for centuries because they’re loaded with nutrients, including vitamins A, B, C, E and K. Avocado butter is a powerful moisturizer and can provide protection against UV rays.
Beeswax: Naturally moistens and softens skin, plus protects against ultraviolet rays.
Worker bees spend their lives building this natural storage unit. Maybe that’s why beeswax helps create a natural, breathable barrier on the skin, protecting against dryness and irritants like the sun.
Candelilla wax: Gives our stick formula its staying power.
Candelilla wax is a plant-derived wax that slightly raises the melting temperature of our medicated lip balm stick formulas, allowing them to better maintain their shape and form. It also helps lips retain moisture over time.
Caprylic/capric triglyceride: A natural skin softener that helps prevent drying.
A natural fat that comes from coconuts, caprylic/capric triglyceride helps prevent drying, absorbs quickly and is so gentle it’s often used in formulations for sensitive skin.
Cocoa seed butter: An excellent natural emollient that helps moisturization.
Cocoa butter is natural fat extracted from the cocoa bean during the chocolate-making process. Used to treat skin conditions such as eczema and dermatitis, cocoa butter helps with moisturization, protects from environmental factors and helps prevent dryness and cracking.
Coconut oil: Natural moisturizer that helps hydrate and smooth skin.
Coconut oil is a natural moisturizer, like cocoa butter and lanolin. These and other emollients give you healthy-looking lips by moistening and preventing dryness and chapping associated with environmental effects.
Cold pressed cranberry seed oil: Hydrates and protects from free radicals.
Harvested from a chemical-free process, cold pressed cranberry seed oil is rich in antioxidants, vitamin E and essential fatty acids (EFAs) omega 3 & 6, providing hydration and protection from damaging free radicals that accelerate the appearance of aging.
Colloidal oatmeal: Soothes skin itch and irritation.
Colloidal oatmeal, also known as Avena sativa L., has been used for centuries as a soothing agent to help relieve itch and skin irritation. Colloidal oatmeal provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and comprises starches and beta-glucan that provide protective water-holding functions.
Meadowfoam seed oil: Adds long-lasting moisturization and rejuvenates lips.
Derived from a flowering herb plant native to the western United States, meadowfoam seed oil is easily and quickly absorbed by dry skin, plus it soothes irritations and adds a luxurious feel to lip balms and lotions.
Menthol: Cool and refreshing, menthol offers relief from discomfort.
The source of our refreshing tingle, menthol is derived from natural peppermint oil. Its anesthetic properties help soothe dry, chapped lips and cold sores.
Mineral oil: Makes the classic Carmex® Lip Balm formula smooth and squeezable.
Clear and odorless, mineral oil is added to the classic Carmex® Classic Lip Balm formula to make it squeezable, so chapped lips get a silky-smooth treatment.
Safflower seed oil: A botanical moisturizer that soothes and softens skin.
Safflower seed oil is a natural botanical extracted from the safflower seed. It contains omega 6 and other nutrients and acts as a powerful hydrator and skin lubricant, adding elasticity while preventing dryness and smoothing skin.
Shea butter: Helps with moisturization, quickly relieving dryness and cracking.
Natural shea butter is rich with fatty acids that help to maintain elasticity and softness. It protects against excessive dryness from free-radical and sun damage, plus soothes chapped lips almost immediately.
Vitamin E: Helps prevent drying, chapping and the formation of free radicals.
Offers a wide range of benefits for lips and skin. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals, helping to prevent premature aging as well as dryness and chapping. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, soothing damage from the sun, wind or excessively dry environments.

					Ingredients for Relief and Comfort				


Benzocaine: Works on contact to relieve pain and itch due to cold sores.
Benzocaine is an anesthetic agent used to relieve or numb pain, itch and discomfort from cold sores.
Camphor: Alleviates burning, itching and pain of chapped lips and skin.
Camphor is a compound that shares many properties with menthol, such as a cooling effect that relieves burning, itching and pain. An antimicrobial germ-fighter, camphor also acts as a mild local anesthetic.
Dimethicone: Relieves irritation and protects tender lips and skin.
Used at a low concentration, dimethicone helps with spreadability and protects lips and skin with a waterproof layer to preserve natural moisture and relieve discomfort from itching and dryness.
Phenol: Helps ease discomfort of dry lips.
Known for its mild local anesthetic effect, phenol reduces the itching and burning of chapped lips.
Salicylic acid: A mild exfoliant that allows moisturizers to be better absorbed.
In very small, yet effective amounts, salicylic acid helps to gently remove dead, cracked, peeling skin, without affecting the new layer of skin that is constantly renewing itself. This allows soothing ingredients, such as menthol and camphor, to soak in thoroughly and get to work more quickly.
Back to top






					Ingredients for Moisturization and Protection				


Allantoin: Helps with moisturization as it softens, plus helps heal chapping.
Acting as a softener, allantoin soothes irritations, plus helps reduce dryness and flaking. Allantoin also decreases itching by helping dead skin cells slough off, leaving new skin feeling soft and smooth.
Cetyl esters: Hydrate skin and give a silky feel to our lip balms.
Providing a silky, non-sticky glide, cetyl esters are waxes that thicken our lip balms to give them staying power, plus help to moisturize and preserve softness.
Lanolin: Helps protect skin and locks in moisture.
This exceptional, natural ingredient locks in hydration, softens and helps with moisturization. Lanolin mimics skin’s natural ability to provide the proper environment for healing and soothing lips as it restores elasticity.
Octinoxate and oxybenzone: Safe and effective sunscreen filters to protect against the sun’s damaging rays.
Help prevent sunburn and damage to lips, when applied liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.
Petrolatum: Effective in helping create a moisture barrier.
Petrolatum is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration for its effectiveness as a skin protectant. It creates a “bandage” between skin and its environment, penetrating the outermost lip and skin layers to aid in healing and to help prevent irritants and germs from penetrating cracks and cuts.

History[edit]
Alfred Woelbing began experimenting with creating his own line of lip balm and other cosmetic products in the early 1930s in Wisconsin. These were the beginnings of Carma Laboratories, Inc. After experimenting with his products, Woelbing created Carmex on his family's stove top. He began by selling the product from the trunk of his car. Popularity increased through word-of-mouth. During this time Woelbing and his wife poured their lip balm into the now well-known yellow-capped jars. Then in 1957, the family business moved out of the kitchen and into a rented facility in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa.[1]
After doing business like this, Woelbing discontinued making sales calls in 1972 which had mostly been in Wisconsin, Illinois and parts of Indiana. Woelbing's son Don joined the business in 1973 and introduced assembly lines to Carma Labs. In 1975,[2] due to the product's success, a new production facility was built in the southwest suburb of Franklin; production at the same facility continues to the present day.[2][3] The company employs about 100 people. It remains under the ownership of the founding family.[4][5]
Carma Labs began producing the product in squeezable tubes in 1988. In 1989 it began producing it in stick form which had been the longtime form factor for ChapStick and Blistex, Carma's major competitors in the lip balm market. After these expansions within the company's production, in 1993, it was estimated that 9% of the lip balm market was held by Carma Labs. Alfred Woelbing continued to drive to the offices every day until 1997 when he suffered a stroke.[5] He continued to come into the office at least once a week after this,[5] until he died in 2001 at age 100.[6]
The company continued further expansion under the management of Alfred's son Don and grandsons Paul and Eric.[6] In 2002, mint-flavored Carmex lip balm (SPF 30) joined original Carmex lip balm in the product line, and Carmex lip balm became available throughout North America, Australia, Europe, Asia and Africa. During 2006, Internet voters chose strawberry and cherry as the newest Carmex lip balm sticks.
Ingredients[edit]
In the United States, the active ingredients of Carmex lip balm are camphor (1.7%), menthol (0.7%), salicylic acid, and phenol (0.4%)[citation needed]. The inactive ingredients, in order of greatest used to least used in the product, are petrolatum, lanolin, cetyl esters, paraffin wax, cocoa butter, beeswax, and flavor.[7] However, this formula varies slightly around the world. For example, phenol is not included in Germany.[8] The use of phenol in cosmetics is prohibited in the European Union.
Salicylic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) almost identical to aspirin. In fact, aspirin's mechanism of action as an NSAID results from it being metabolized into salicylic acid.[9] It is often incorrectly thought to be a drying agent; however, this is not true. Salicylic acid works as a keratolytic, comedolytic, and bacteriostatic agent, causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth.[10][11]

History[edit]
Alfred Woelbing began experimenting with creating his own line of lip balm and other cosmetic products in the early 1930s in Wisconsin. These were the beginnings of Carma Laboratories, Inc. After experimenting with his products, Woelbing created Carmex on his family's stove top. He began by selling the product from the trunk of his car. Popularity increased through word-of-mouth. During this time Woelbing and his wife poured their lip balm into the now well-known yellow-capped jars. Then in 1957, the family business moved out of the kitchen and into a rented facility in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa.[1]
