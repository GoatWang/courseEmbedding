GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.
Operations[edit]
Key Figures[edit]

154,950 employees in close to 70 countries:

57,750 in electricity and gas
97,200 in services.


€69,883 billion in 2015 revenues.

In October 2009 ranked 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek study of the world's best companies.[31]

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.
Operations[edit]
Key Figures[edit]

Ranked #1 most valuable brand by Brand Finance among utilities.[39]
In October 2009 ranked 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek study of the world's best companies.[31]

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ head office


Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015[2]) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
Engie is a pioneer in nuclear energy in Europe with the development of the first pressurised water reactor built in Belgium. It is one of the few players in the sector to develop expert skills in both upstream (engineering, purchasing, operation, maintenance) and downstream (waste management, dismantling) activities. As a nuclear operator, ENGIE owns and operates seven reactors in Belgium through Electrabel, owns stakes in the Chooz and Tricastin plants in France (1,208 MW – the equivalent of one nuclear reactor) and has drawing rights in Germany.[4]
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Since the merger in 2008, the French state holds approximately a third of the company.[5] It adopted the "Engie" name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.[6]
The company holds a 35% stake in Suez Environnement, the water treatment and waste management company spun off from Suez at the time of the merger.[7] GDF Suez bought 70% of Britain's International Power in August 2010, creating the world's largest independent utility company.[8][9] The purchase of the remaining 30% was announced by GDF Suez in April 2012, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10][11] On July 1, 2015, the company announced the acquisition of solar parks developer Solairedirect, which makes it the largest solar power electricity producer in France.[12]
As of 2015, Engie employs 154,950 people worldwide with revenues of €69.9 billion. Engie is listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris and Brussels and is a constituent of the CAC 40 and BEL20 indices.

History[edit]
Background (before 2006)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
Prior to the GDF Suez merger plans in 2006, the company existed as two separate French multinational corporations - Suez S.A. and Gaz de France, with a heritage tracing two .
Suez was (and still remains, through GDF Suez as) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world as the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. One line of corporate history dates back to the 1822 founded Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). The origin of its name 'Suez' traces back to its other founding entity – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez founded in 1858 to build the Suez Canal. Suez S.A. was the result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
Gaz de France was created in 1946 along with its sister company Électricité de France (EDF) by the French Government. After the liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets, Gaz de France also entered into the electricity sector, having developed combined natural gas-electricity offerings. The company's capital was partially floated on the Paris Stock Exchange in July 2005, raising €2.5 billion for the French Government.[13]
Evolution of GDF Suez (2006 - 2008)[edit]
See also: Suez (company) and Gaz de France
On 25 February 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of water supply and treatment, waste management and energy company Suez and power firm Gaz de France, with the aim of creating the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[14] Since the French state owned over 80% of Gaz de France, it was necessary to pass a new law in order to make the merger possible. Whilst Nicolas Sarkozy was for several months opposed to the Villepin government’s plans for a merger of the two companies, preferring a three-way deal with Italy's Enel which would maintain a controlling stake for the state,[15] he subsequently accepted the government proposal.[16]
The plan for a merger between Gaz de France and Suez came under fire from the whole of the political left,[17] which feared the loss of one of the last ways of preventing the price rises experienced over the previous three years, and by the social Gaullists and trade unions.[18][19] In August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted a record-breaking 137,449 amendments to the proposed legislation. Under normal procedure, parliament would have been required to vote on the amendments, which would have taken 10 years.[20] The French Constitution does give the government options to bypass such a filibuster, but in the end these were not used.[21]
Law No. 2006-1537 of 7 December 2006 on the energy sector authorised the privatisation of Gaz de France. On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger, on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France.[22] Various holdings of Gaz de France and Suez had to be divested in order to satisfy the concerns of the European Commissioner for Competition: GDF agreed to sell its approximate 25% stake in Belgian electricity producer SPE for €515 million. The stake was purchased by fellow SPE shareholder Centrica which exercised its right of first refusal,[23] blocking a previous agreement to sell the stake to Électricité de France.[24] Suez, meanwhile, was forced to reduce its shareholding in natural gas distributor Fluxys[25] and sell its Belgian gas supply subsidiary Distrigas to Eni.[26]
GDF Suez (2008 - 2015)[edit]
The newly created GDF Suez came into existence on 22 July 2008; the world's second-largest utility with over €74 billion in annual revenues.[27] The deal resulted in the conversion of the French state's 80% stake in GDF into just over 35% of shares of the new company. The water and waste assets which formerly formed part of Suez were spun off into a new publicly traded company, Suez Environment, in which GDF Suez retains a stake.
In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded a deal according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.[28]
In July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez and E.ON €553 million both over arrangements on the MEGAL pipeline.[28][29] It was the second biggest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first one on the energy sector.[28][30]
In October 2009, GDF Suez placed 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek ranking of the "World's Best Companies", the highest-placed European firm.[31]
On 10 August 2010, the company announced a merger of its GDF SUEZ Energy International business unit, along with its operations within the United Kingdom and Turkey, with International Power. The acquisition created the world’s biggest independent power producer, and the enlarged company will retain International Power's listing on the London Stock Exchange and be 70% owned by GDF Suez.[8][9][32]
In December 2010, GDF SUEZ became the key founding member of the 'Medgrid' company[33] - a consortium of twenty plus utilities, grid operators, equipment makers, financing institutions and investors; which will implement the 'Medgrid project', a French renewable energy initiative within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM). The project, planned in North Africa, aims to promote and develop a Euro-Mediterranean electricity network of 20GW installed generating capacity, with 5GW being devoted for exports to Europe. The Medgrid together with the German initiated Desertec project[34] would serve as the backbone of the European Supergrid.[35][36]
On 16 April 2012, the purchase of the remaining 30% of International Power was announced by GDF Suez, and the transaction completed in July 2012.[10] GDF Suez was advised by Rothschild and Ondra Partners, while Barclays, Morgan Stanley and Nomura advised International Power.[10][11]
On 9 August 2013, GDF Suez, through its Energy Services business line, announced the purchase of Balfour Beatty’s UK Facilities Management business – Balfour Beatty WorkPlace. The legacy Cofely business incorporated the legacy Balfour Beatty Workplace Business which went on to aqquire Lend Lease FM in 2014 from Lend Lease Group giving the new business a substantial platform in the operation of PFI assets in the UK.
GDF Suez becomes Engie: 2015 - present[edit]
On April 24, 2015, GDF Suez announced it has changed its name to "Engie", in an effort to further expand the company's international footprint. CEO and Chairman Gérard Mestrallet said the new name was a symbol to meet the challenges of the energy transition and accelerate the group's development.[37]
In July 2015, Engie acquired 95% of Solairedirect, raising its photovoltaic production from 125 to 486 MW.
On 2nd March 2017, Engie acquired Keepmoat Regeneration for £330m.
Operations[edit]

Ranked #1 most valuable brand by Brand Finance among utilities.[39]
In October 2009 ranked 6th in an A.T. Kearney/BusinessWeek study of the world's best companies.[31]

Electricity generation[edit]
France[edit]
Thanks to former Suez subsidiaries such as Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR), Electrabel and Société Hydro Electrique du Midi (SHEM), GDF Suez is the second-largest generator of electricity in France[40] behind EDF.[41] The company indicated in December 2011 that ¾ of the group's production comes from sources that emit no CO2 principally hydroelectricity (through CNR and SHEM) and wind power, the latter of which both Gaz de France and Suez moved aggressively into in 2007 and 2008.[42] Recently acquired subsidiaries include La Compagnie du Vent (majority stake),[43] the wind farm business of Nass & Wind[44] and Erelia.[45] The company also operates a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant (DK6) in Dunkirk. With the stated aim of reaching a total production capacity of 10 GW by 2013, three gas-fired thermal power plants at Fos-sur-Mer, Montoir-de-Bretagne and Saint-Brieuc are currently in various stages of development, as is a solar panel project in Curbans.[42]
International[edit]
The GDF Suez group also generates electricity in a number of countries outside France. Most notably, the company is the leading producer in both Belgium and the Netherlands through Electrabel[46] (and the fifth-largest generator in Europe overall),[47] as well as the largest non-state owned generator in both Brazil[48] and Thailand[49] (thanks to majority stakes in ENGIE Brasil and Glow Energy respectively). GDF Suez also holds a 50% stake in NuGeneration (NuGen), a company planning to build a new nuclear power station of up to 3.6 GW capacity at Sellafield in the United Kingdom.[50] The other 50% of NuGen is held by Iberdrola. The company also operates in North and Latin America through its Suez Energy International unit, as well as in other European and Asian countries. The company generates electricity through various types of plants, including thermal power, nuclear power, combined heat and power, wind farms, hydroelectric and biomass.[51] Engie is currently developing a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant in Sinop, Turkey in partnership with Itochu and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.[52]
In November 2016, Engie signed an agreement with Moroccan energy company Nareva. The two companies are planning to develop energy assets in North and Western Africa that will produce 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts. The plans will take place between 2020 and 2025.[53]

Coal-fired power plants[edit]
In October 2015, Engie announced that it will no longer build coal-fired power plants. Gérard Mestrallet said projects for which Engie had already entered into firm commitments would be honored, but projects where contracts had not yet been signed will de facto be suspended. As a result, Engie abandoned two coal-fired power plants projects in Ada Yumurtalik (Turkey) and in Thabametsi (South Africa).[54] In February 2016, Engie announced the selling of its stakes in the Paiton power plant located in Indonesia and in the Meenakshi power plant located in India.[55] Engie also announced the closing of the Rugeley power station in England.[56]
In May 2016 Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher told a French Senate committee that it was planning a gradual withdrawal from coal-fired generation over the coming years. This could include closure of, or sale of its stake in, the lignite-fired Hazelwood power station in Victoria, Australia.[57]

GDF SUEZ




Assignment
GDF Suez selected eVision’s electronic logbook software to manage shift handover process more efficiently. Shift Vision has been implemented on E&P Norge’s Gjøa platform. Prior to the implementation of Shift Vision, eVision delivered a made-to-measure eLearning and training programme.
Profile
Engie (known as GDF Suez prior to April 2015) is a French multinational electric utility company, headquartered in La Défense, Courbevoie, which operates in the fields of electricity generation and distribution, natural gas and renewable energy. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.
The company, formed on 22 July 2008 by the merger of Gaz de France and Suez, traces its origins to the Universal Suez Canal Company founded in 1858 to construct the Suez Canal. Following the merger in 2008, the French state held approximately 35.7% of GDF Suez. It adopted the “Engie” name in April 2015 in order to emphasize the changing nature of its energy business and de-emphasize its historical role as a nationalized gas monopoly.

Suez S.A. was a leading French-based multinational corporation headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris,[1] with operations primarily in water, electricity and natural gas supply, and waste management. Suez was result of a 1997 merger between the Compagnie de Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux, a leading French water company. In the early 2000s Suez also owned some media and telecommunications assets, but has since divested these. According to the Masons Water Yearbook 2004/5, Suez served 117.4 million people around the world. The company conducted a merger of equals with fellow utility company Gaz de France on 22 July 2008 to form GDF Suez.[2] The water and waste assets of Suez were spun off into a separate publicly traded company, Suez Environnement.[2]

History[edit]
Suez was (and remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world, with one line of corporate history dating back to the 1822 founding of the Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter begunstiging van de volksvlijt (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). Its form prior to the GDF merger was the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. Its most recent name comes from the involvement of one of its several founding entities – the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez – in building the Suez Canal in the mid-19th century.
Merger with Gaz de France[edit]
On February 25, 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of Suez and Gaz de France, which would make the world's largest liquefied natural gas company.[3] The revenue of GDF was around 22.4 billion euros in 2005, compared to 41.5 billion for Suez. The CGT trade-union called the merger a "disguised privatization."[4]
On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger. The deal was conducted on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. The French state holds more than 35% of shares of the merged company, GDF Suez.[5] As a consequence of the conditions posed by the European Commission with regards to allowing the merger, on 29 May 2008 Suez sold its Belgian gas supplier Distrigas to the Italian company Eni for €2.7 billion.[6] On 22 July 2008 the group GDF Suez, a company of €74 billion of annual turnover, was officially created.[2]

GDF Suez
How GDF Suez accelerated their file access requests and improved employee satisfaction
PDF download





The Customer
Location: Paris, France
Industry: Energy
Products: DatAdvantage and DataPrivilege
GDF SUEZ’s headquarters are in France and the group has a global presence with representation in every continent. Its origins can be traced back to the early 19th Century, and today the Group’s businesses are developed around a model based on responsible growth, which champion current major energy and environmental challenges – meeting energy needs, ensuring the security of supply, combating climate change and optimising the use of resources.
With 219,300 people, the Group provides gas and electricity to millions of customers the world over (private individuals, professionals, businesses and local communities). Its strength lies in offering proposals based on a mix of energies and specific services that combine efficiency and safety with supply reliability. It prides itself on utilising high-performance production facilities combined with one of the world’s most diversified gas supply portfolios.
It is listed on the Brussels, Paris and Luxembourg stock exchanges and is represented in the main international indices: CAC 40, BEL 20, DJ Euro Stoxx 50, Euronext 100, FTSE Eurotop 100, MSCI Europe, ASPI Eurozone and Vigeo World 120.












A process that previously took five or six days now takes just a few hours.

– Thibaud Desforges, Tool and Processing Manager, GDF SUEZ





The Challenge
GDF SUEZ had 22,000 users accessing 11 terabytes of data, which was doubling year on year, stored within its French perimeter. At that time file access requests were a complex, two stage process – the request was made through a front end system, then translated and validated by the data owner, and then entered into separate back office system that initiated action by IT. For the IT team, receiving up to 50 to 60 permission requests a day, it was a complex and labour intensive process, and for the end users it was drawn out and frustrating.
In parallel, GDF SUEZ’s global internal ‘Income’ audit identified permissions as an area that would benefit from tighter controls. It highlighted a need for documentation that would verify all file access requests had the correct validation, and were registered within a single database.
Evaluation Parameters
Thibaud Desforges, GDF SUEZ’s Tool and Processing Manager, researched the market to evaluate potential solutions and selected Varonis DatAdvantage and DataPrivilege. Mr. Desforges explains, “There were three key reasons for our selection of Varonis. First is the graphical interface, particularly DataPrivilege’s, as it is very easy to manipulate and the interface is intuitive, especially for those users who do not work in the IT field. The second one was how powerful the combined solution is, especially in terms of capacity – we are managing over 350 servers. Lastly was the speed we were able to implement the solution across the GDF SUEZ perimeter. It took roughly between five and seven days which is exceptionally fast for this kind of solution.”
Security is another area that GDF SUEZ highlights as a strong point. After implementing DataPrivilege and DatAdvantage, the Group added DatAdvantage for Directory Services, which has allowed it to increase its security level checks in active Directory.
As part of the evaluation process, especially in context of the economic and financial climate, GDF SUEZ has to demonstrate return on investment (ROI) prior to any expenditure commitment. Varonis worked closely with Mr. Desforges to produce demonstrable metrics specific to GDF SUEZ that validated how the solution would yield tangible ROI for the Group.
The Solution
Prior to this project GDF SUEZ found it difficult to produce reports that identified data owners, nor who was accessing what files.
Since introducing Varonis DatAdvantage, GDF SUEZ is now able to accumulate its Active Directory user and group details, ACL information and all data access events – without requiring native OS auditing. This complete picture has allowed data owners to understand exactly how much information is stored on the servers, who can and who is accessing these files, and identify any user whose permissions need to be revoked. Mr. Desforges adds, “We’re always looking for ways to reduce IT expenditure and lowering expensive storage space is one example. The reports DatAdvantage produces allow us to identify files that are no longer accessed and, working with the data owners, these are archived, reducing the need to continuously increase server capacity.”
Arguably DataPrivilege is where the greatest benefit has been realised, enabling GDF SUEZ to dramatically improve and accelerate its file access requests. Using the configurable web interface, replacing the previous front and back end systems with a single self-service portal, users can request access for themselves via the DataPrivilege portal. The request is automatically routed to the appropriate data owner who confirms (or declines) the request, and, on approval, correct permissions are automatically provisioned.
Mr. Desforges confirms, “A process that previously took five or six days now takes just a few hours. As all records are documented, we’re able to produce reports that weren’t possible previously, that addresses the ‘Income’ audit requirement to document permissions validation. In terms of man-hours, theoretically the time saved from introducing DatAdvantage and DataPrivilege would allow us huge potential savings – freeing up staff for other tasks.”
GDF SUEZ has found users who have reacted positively to the introduction of DatAdvantage and DataPrivilege, as verified with a dramatic increase in employee satisfaction – from 70% to 91%, since deploying Varonis. Training has been relatively pain free – taking just a few hours for standard users, due largely to the friendly jargon free interface. Data owners have taken slightly longer to familiarise with the various elements, as is to be expected with a larger range of functionality, but are now able to take control and actively participate in the process.
Moving forward GDF SUEZ is looking to deploy DatAdvantage and DataPrivilege into its other territories, starting with Belgium in the near future.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
