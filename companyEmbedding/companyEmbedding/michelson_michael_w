Gary K. Michelson; SABIN Humanitarian Award Video

2015-11-19Christopher Edward JonesMMRF in Action


Dr Gary K. Michelson has this year been awarded the Albert B. Sabin Humanitarian Award in recognition of his significant and continual efforts to combat global health issues. Funding provided by Dr Michelson has in recent years supported numerous research programmes, allowing the progression of both lab-based vaccine development, and vaccine advocacy and education at a global, governmental level.

In a presentation ceremony held at the SABIN Vaccine Institute, Dr Peter J. Hotez, President of the Institute and Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine, spoke of his admiration for Dr Gary K. Michelson, whom he described as a man striving towards “humanitarian goals.”
Meanwhile Michael W. Marine, CEO of the SABIN Institute, claimed the Institute felt “very fortunate” to have Dr Michelson’s support in their mission to create “a world free of needless human suffering from vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases.”
Neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, have been a central focus of the programmes funded by Dr Michelson. NTDs primarily affect the most impoverished and vulnerable populations on Earth and have a devastating impact upon global human health. However due to lack of awareness amongst governing bodies, the vulnerability of affected populations, and lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies and private research institutes, global response to the growing problem of NTDs has been slow and lacking.
One particularly successful programme which Dr Michelson has funded is the NTD Special Envoy programme, which approaches the problem of NTDs from a political perspective by raising global awareness of NTDs and encouraging pro-activity from world governments. The initiative reaches out to countries where NTDs are endemic, offering encouragement and support, and also reaches out to G7/8 and G20 countries to promote a global response from the world’s wealthiest and most powerful governments and coalitions.



The latest Special Envoy for the Global Network, Dr. Mirta Roses Periago travelled to Canada in the Fall of 2014 to meet with government officials. Making a strong call for Canadian policymakers to add NTDs as a component to their development efforts, emphasizing the linkages to maternal, newborn and child health – including malnutrition – the primary focus for Canada’s development policy. Dr. Roses was also key, alongside the NGO effect:hope, in ensuring that Canadian officials raised the NTDs issue during a highly publicized meeting between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and NTDs advocate Bill Gates. This led to the Canadian government to call for NTD treatment to be raised during the June 2015 G7 Summit, hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Photo Credit: World Health Organization).

The effectiveness and successes of the programme led to NTDs being a heavily discussed subject at the G7 summit in June this year. During the summit, all G7 countries made a “firm commitment to advance the fight against NTDs and to alleviate the misery of vulnerable and neglected populations.” This commitment will manifest as monetary investment in both “prevention and control efforts” and “research and development” in the area of NTDs.
Many G7 countries have independently taken considerable, concrete steps towards creating programmes aimed at combatting NTDs.
The Canadian government this year announced $4.4 million funding for a project aiming to limit the impact of NTDs in North Africa. The funding recipient, an NGO named effect:hope, will aim to prevent the spread of NTDs in Côte-d’Ivoire and Kenya by delivering deworming treatments and Vitamin A tablets to children under the age of 5.
Meanwhile Japan has also shown a commitment to eliminating NTDs, with the Japanese Agency for Medical Research and Development agreeing to fund the International Joint Research Program to address NTDs in Africa. The $9 million initiative aims to encourage researchers in African countries to conduct research into NTDs, building upon the work of Japanese researchers.

During the Award ceremony, Michael W. Marine referenced these significant successes by describing the “game-changing impact” that Dr Michelson has had in “bringing NTDs to the consciousness of global decision makers.”
It is hoped that with the support of Dr Michelson, sustainable and meaningful progress towards easing the global burden of NTDs will continue, as with over 1.8 billion people across over 70 endemic countries currently at risk of being infected, it is clear that progress is desperately necessary to provide neglected populations with relief and protection from these debilitating diseases.
