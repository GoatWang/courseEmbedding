Our Strategies
Let's Plan Your Future






 





 



 



 
 
 





Kessler Investment Group (KIG) is dedicated to providing individually managed portfolios for individual investors and institutions. Kessler Investment Group manages client portfolios on a discretionary basis and is compensated exclusively by an asset-based fee. We do not charge or accept commissions.
Working with Kessler Investment Group is different than working with a traditional broker or investment salesperson. Here you will know that our incentive is aligned with yours. Our reward does not come from a corporate office and is not based on how much commission we generated for a brokerage firm. Client satisfaction is our reward and investment performance is the yardstick used to measure our success.
Below you will find information about our three investment strategies. Before opening an account, we will meet with you to fully assess your investment objective and determine which portfolio might be right for you.
 
Investment Strategies
At Kessler Investment Group, our goal is to help clients achieve their investment goals by delivering investment results that exceed their expectations.
 
The Dividend Income Portfolio

Objective
The Dividend Income portfolio is a diversified stock portfolio with the primary objective of providing a dividend yield that is consistent with that of the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index. The portfolio’s secondary objective is to protect capital.
Identify the Universe
The first step in the KIG investment process is to identify the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index sectors that are expected to outperform the broader market. To establish the list of sectors, the portfolio manager applies the proprietary AVP process. Once the sectors have been identified, the portfolio manager will “drill down” to find stocks that meet the KIG investment criteria. These criteria are designed to identify companies with the following qualities:
• Well-capitalized with strong balance sheet.
• A history of consistent and growing dividend payments.
Examine Cash Flow Characteristics
Strong companies pay dividends to shareholders out of cash flow. Historically, companies that have consistently increased their cash flows have rewarded their shareholders with increased dividends and superior total returns.
Select Companies
The stocks selected for the portfolio are those that meet the KIG investment objectives, trade at attractive valuations and are likely to exceed market expectations for future cash flows.
Kessler Investment Group, LLC is an Investment Adviser registered with the SEC. Advisory services are only offered to clients or prospective clients where Kessler Investment Group, LLC and its representatives are properly licensed or exempt from licensure.
 
 
The Balanced Portfolio

Objective
The Balanced portfolio is designed for investors looking for the stable income that can come from fixed income investments with the potential for growth that comes from equities.
Portfolio Construction
The portfolio is constructed by blending high-quality fixed income securities with the Dividend Income portfolio.
The target allocation of equity securities and bonds is determined based on the client’s initial interview at the time the account is opened. During annual reviews, or more frequently if necessary, the allocation will be adjusted so as to remain consistent with the client’s investment objective. Portfolio weightings of equities vs. fixed income will range in percentage from 70/30 equity/fixed income to 30/70 equity/fixed income as determined by the client’s objectives.
Fixed income securities are selected based on the client’s liquidity needs and risk profile.  KIG selects fixed income securities that are considered “liquid”, meaning there is an active market available for trading.  Fixed income securities selected may include, but are not limited to; individual bonds, preferred stocks, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Kessler Investment Group, LLC is an Investment Adviser registered with the SEC. Advisory services are only offered to clients or prospective clients where Kessler Investment Group, LLC and its representatives are properly licensed or exempt from licensure.
 
 
The Total Return Portfolio

Objective
The Total Return portfolio is a diversified, “go anywhere” portfolio which is comprised of individual stocks and/or bonds that KIG believes will deliver superior upside potential to that of the overall market as measured by the Russell 3000® Index. At KIG, we believe avoiding downside risk is a key ingredient to achieving the portfolio’s objective. This means the portfolio will not remain fully invested at all times. When market conditions dictate, the portfolio manager will reduce the portfolio’s exposure to the stock and/or bond market.
Identify the Universe
The first step in building the portfolio is to identify the stock market sectors which the KIG investment process determines may outperform the broader market. To establish the list of sectors, KIG applies the proprietary Active vs. Passive (“AVP”) process. Once the sectors have been identified, we drill down to find the stocks that meet our investment criteria. These criteria are designed to identify companies with the following qualities:  Well-capitalized with a strong balance sheet; Record of financial strength and profit growth
Examine the Technical Picture
The chart of a company’s stock price gives a history of what investors have been willing to pay for the company. KIG believes this is important information and gives the portfolio manager the opportunity to gauge whether the stock is over-owned or ready to be accumulated.
Stocks or Bonds?
The KIG approach is to use both stocks and bonds to achieve the portfolio’s objective of outperforming the broad market, as measured by the Russell 3000® Index.  At times, bonds offer a better opportunity for upside returns than stocks. To invest solely in stocks, when the objective is total return, decreases the chance for success.
Portfolio Selection
The stocks and bonds selected for the portfolio are those that meet the investment objective of the portfolio, exhibit attractive price charts and represent the “best of breed” within their sector.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
