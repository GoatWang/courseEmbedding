For individuals, families and institutions. For over 40 years.



Begun 40 years ago, Penn Davis McFarland still proudly serves our first and founding clients.
In 1977, Fred Penn, John Davis and John McFarland created our investment advisory firm to provide wealth and asset management for a select clientele.
The firm has grown. But we have succeeded in maintaining the same personal attention to detail and client needs that inspired us in the beginning. Perhaps this is because all of our founders are still active in the firm.
At Penn Davis McFarland, we strive every day to help our clients protect and grow their financial assets.

Single-minded focus on multi-generational wealth.



Investment management is seen by many as being all about assets and numbers. To us, though, the landscape is somewhat different.
Ours is a people business, focused on client service that produces, protects and preserves wealth. At Penn Davis McFarland, we preserve and grow wealth, making sure that capital is there for the next generation, and the next after that.
To accomplish this, we flexibly customize our approach to every client’s portfolio. We have no specific products to sell, which prevents conflicts of interest. We do not rely on titles like managing director or portfolio manager. We work as a team with one common goal – our client’s ongoing success.
Our style is best-described as communicative and open. We are known for our unbiased and objective client guidance.
Ours is a seasoned staff of investment professionals who provide close personal attention to our clients. We do this to ensure that every client is served by the expertise of the entire firm, not simply by an individual advisor.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
