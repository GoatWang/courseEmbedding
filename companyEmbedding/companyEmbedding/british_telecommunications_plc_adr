US dividends
BT's dividends are normally paid twice a year, with final dividends paid in September, and interim dividends paid in February. The dividend payment for ADR holders is normally one week after the payment date for the ordinary shares and the amount is translated from Sterling into US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the dividends were paid to holders of ordinary shares. With effect from 8 December 2015 the ratio of BT shares to one ADR changed from 10:1 to 5:1.
