From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert Jeremy Goltho Grantham CBE (born 6 October 1938) is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo (GMO), a Boston-based asset management firm. GMO is one of the largest managers of such funds in the world, having more than US $118 billion in assets under management as of March 2015.[1] Grantham is regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor in various stock, bond, and commodity markets, and is particularly noted for his prediction of various bubbles.[2] He has been a vocal critic of various governmental responses to the Global Financial Crisis.[3][4] Grantham started one of the world's first index funds in the early 1970s.[5]
In 2011 he was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets magazine.

Early life[edit]
Grantham was born in Ware, Hertfordshire[6] and grew up in Doncaster.[7] He studied Economics at the University of Sheffield. In 1966 he completed an MBA at Harvard Business School.
Investment philosophy[edit]
Grantham's investment philosophy can be summarized by his commonly used phrase "reversion to the mean." Essentially, he believes that all asset classes and markets will revert to mean historical levels from highs and lows. His firm seeks to understand historical changes in markets and predict results for seven years into the future. When there is deviation from historical means (averages), the firm may take an investment position based on a return to the mean. The firm allocates assets based on internal predictions of market direction.[8]
Views on market bubbles and the 2007-2008 credit crisis[edit]
Grantham has built much of his investing reputation over his long career by correctly identifying speculative market "bubbles" as they were happening and steering clients' assets clear of impending crashes. Grantham avoided investing in Japanese equities and real estate in the late eighties, as well as technology stocks during the Internet bubble in the late nineties.
In GMO's April 2010 Quarterly Letter Grantham spoke to the tendency for all bubbles to revert to the mean saying:


“
For the record, I wrote an article for Fortune published in September 2007 that referred to three “near certainties”: profit margins would come down, the housing market would break, and the risk-premium all over the world would widen, each with severe consequences. You can perhaps only have that degree of confidence if you have been to the history books as much as we have and looked at every bubble and every bust. We have found that there are no exceptions. We are up to 34 completed bubbles. Every single one of them has broken all the way back to the trend that existed prior to the bubble forming, which is a very tough standard. So it’s simply illogical to give up the really high probabilities involved at the asset class level. All the data errors that frighten us all at the individual stock level are washed away at these great aggregations. It’s simply more reliable, higher-quality data.[9]
”


In his Fall 2008 GMO letter, Grantham commented on the underlying causes of the world credit crisis:


“
To avoid the development of crises, you need a plentiful supply of foresight, imagination, and competence. A few quarters ago I likened our financial system to an elaborate suspension bridge, hopefully built with some good, old-fashioned Victorian over-engineering. Well, it wasn’t over-engineered! It was built to do just one under favorable conditions. Now with hurricanes blowing, the Corps of Engineers, as it were, are working around the clock to prop up a suspiciously jerry-built edifice. When a crisis occurs, you need competence and courage to deal with it. The bitterest disappointment of this crisis has been how completely the build-up of the bubbles in asset prices and risk-taking was rationalized and ignored by the authorities, especially the formerly esteemed Chairman of the Fed. ...[10]
”




“
I ask myself, ‘Why is it that several dozen people saw this crisis coming for years?’ I described it as being like watching a train wreck in very slow motion. It seemed so inevitable and so merciless, and yet the bosses of Merrill Lynch and Citi and even U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke — none of them seemed to see it coming.
I have a theory that people who find themselves running major-league companies are real organization-management types who focus on what they are doing this quarter or this annual budget. They are somewhat impatient, and focused on the present. Seeing these things requires more people with a historical perspective who are more thoughtful and more right-brained — but we end up with an army of left-brained immediate doers.
So it’s more or less guaranteed that every time we get an outlying, obscure event that has never happened before in history, they are always going to miss it. And the three or four-dozen-odd characters screaming about it are always going to be ignored. . . .
So we kept putting organization people — people who can influence and persuade and cajole — into top jobs that once-in-a-blue-moon take great creativity and historical insight. But they don’t have those skills.[10]

”


Grantham focused on the issue of personal traits and leadership in trying to explain how we reached the current economic crisis.
Views on fossil fuels and the Keystone pipeline[edit]
Grantham has repeatedly stated that the rising cost of energy - the most fundamental commodity - between 2002 and 2008 has falsely inflated economic growth and GDP figures worldwide and that we have been in a "carbon bubble" for approximately the last 250 years in which energy was very cheap. He believes that this bubble is coming to an end. He has stated his opposition to the Keystone Pipeline on the basis of the ruinous environmental consequences that its construction will bring to Alberta and to the entire planet due to the contribution that burning the extracted oil would make to climate change.[2][11]
Philanthropy[edit]
Grantham, together with his wife Hannelore, established the Grantham Foundation For the Protection of the Environment in 1997. Substantial commitments have been made to Imperial College London, the London School of Economics and the University of Sheffield, to establish the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, respectively, which will enable the institutions to build on their extensive expertise in climate change research.[12] The 2011 tax filing for the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment shows the Foundation donated $1 million to both the Sierra Club and to Nature Conservancy, and $2 million to the Environmental Defense Fund that year. The Foundation has also provided support to Greenpeace, the WWF and the Smithsonian. From 2006-2012, The Grantham Foundation for Protection of the Environment funded a $75,000 prize for environmental reporting. The prize was administered by the University of Rhode Island's Metcalf Institute for Marine & Environmental Reporting.[7][13]
Awards and honours[edit]
This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
Grantham was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for philanthropic service to climate change research.[14]

2009 Honorary degree, Imperial College, London.[15]
2010 Honorary degree, The New School, New York.[16]
2012 Honorary degree, The University of Sheffield.[17]

Jeremy Grantham

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert Jeremy Goltho Grantham CBE (born 6 October 1938) is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo (GMO), a Boston-based asset management firm. GMO is one of the largest managers of such funds in the world, having more than US $118 billion in assets under management as of March 2015.[1] Grantham is regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor in various stock, bond, and commodity markets, and is particularly noted for his prediction of various bubbles.[2] He has been a vocal critic of various governmental responses to the Global Financial Crisis.[3][4] Grantham started one of the world's first index funds in the early 1970s.[5]
In 2011 he was included in the 50 Most Influential ranking of Bloomberg Markets magazine.

Early life[edit]
Grantham was born in Ware, Hertfordshire[6] and grew up in Doncaster.[7] He studied Economics at the University of Sheffield. In 1966 he completed an MBA at Harvard Business School.
Investment philosophy[edit]
Grantham's investment philosophy can be summarized by his commonly used phrase "reversion to the mean." Essentially, he believes that all asset classes and markets will revert to mean historical levels from highs and lows. His firm seeks to understand historical changes in markets and predict results for seven years into the future. When there is deviation from historical means (averages), the firm may take an investment position based on a return to the mean. The firm allocates assets based on internal predictions of market direction.[8]
Views on market bubbles and the 2007-2008 credit crisis[edit]
Grantham has built much of his investing reputation over his long career by correctly identifying speculative market "bubbles" as they were happening and steering clients' assets clear of impending crashes. Grantham avoided investing in Japanese equities and real estate in the late eighties, as well as technology stocks during the Internet bubble in the late nineties.
In GMO's April 2010 Quarterly Letter Grantham spoke to the tendency for all bubbles to revert to the mean saying:


“
For the record, I wrote an article for Fortune published in September 2007 that referred to three “near certainties”: profit margins would come down, the housing market would break, and the risk-premium all over the world would widen, each with severe consequences. You can perhaps only have that degree of confidence if you have been to the history books as much as we have and looked at every bubble and every bust. We have found that there are no exceptions. We are up to 34 completed bubbles. Every single one of them has broken all the way back to the trend that existed prior to the bubble forming, which is a very tough standard. So it’s simply illogical to give up the really high probabilities involved at the asset class level. All the data errors that frighten us all at the individual stock level are washed away at these great aggregations. It’s simply more reliable, higher-quality data.[9]
”


In his Fall 2008 GMO letter, Grantham commented on the underlying causes of the world credit crisis:


“
To avoid the development of crises, you need a plentiful supply of foresight, imagination, and competence. A few quarters ago I likened our financial system to an elaborate suspension bridge, hopefully built with some good, old-fashioned Victorian over-engineering. Well, it wasn’t over-engineered! It was built to do just one under favorable conditions. Now with hurricanes blowing, the Corps of Engineers, as it were, are working around the clock to prop up a suspiciously jerry-built edifice. When a crisis occurs, you need competence and courage to deal with it. The bitterest disappointment of this crisis has been how completely the build-up of the bubbles in asset prices and risk-taking was rationalized and ignored by the authorities, especially the formerly esteemed Chairman of the Fed. ...[10]
”




“
I ask myself, ‘Why is it that several dozen people saw this crisis coming for years?’ I described it as being like watching a train wreck in very slow motion. It seemed so inevitable and so merciless, and yet the bosses of Merrill Lynch and Citi and even U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke — none of them seemed to see it coming.
I have a theory that people who find themselves running major-league companies are real organization-management types who focus on what they are doing this quarter or this annual budget. They are somewhat impatient, and focused on the present. Seeing these things requires more people with a historical perspective who are more thoughtful and more right-brained — but we end up with an army of left-brained immediate doers.
So it’s more or less guaranteed that every time we get an outlying, obscure event that has never happened before in history, they are always going to miss it. And the three or four-dozen-odd characters screaming about it are always going to be ignored. . . .
So we kept putting organization people — people who can influence and persuade and cajole — into top jobs that once-in-a-blue-moon take great creativity and historical insight. But they don’t have those skills.[10]

”


Grantham focused on the issue of personal traits and leadership in trying to explain how we reached the current economic crisis.
Views on fossil fuels and the Keystone pipeline[edit]
Grantham has repeatedly stated that the rising cost of energy - the most fundamental commodity - between 2002 and 2008 has falsely inflated economic growth and GDP figures worldwide and that we have been in a "carbon bubble" for approximately the last 250 years in which energy was very cheap. He believes that this bubble is coming to an end. He has stated his opposition to the Keystone Pipeline on the basis of the ruinous environmental consequences that its construction will bring to Alberta and to the entire planet due to the contribution that burning the extracted oil would make to climate change.[2][11]
Philanthropy[edit]
Grantham, together with his wife Hannelore, established the Grantham Foundation For the Protection of the Environment in 1997. Substantial commitments have been made to Imperial College London, the London School of Economics and the University of Sheffield, to establish the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures, respectively, which will enable the institutions to build on their extensive expertise in climate change research.[12] The 2011 tax filing for the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment shows the Foundation donated $1 million to both the Sierra Club and to Nature Conservancy, and $2 million to the Environmental Defense Fund that year. The Foundation has also provided support to Greenpeace, the WWF and the Smithsonian. From 2006-2012, The Grantham Foundation for Protection of the Environment funded a $75,000 prize for environmental reporting. The prize was administered by the University of Rhode Island's Metcalf Institute for Marine & Environmental Reporting.[7][13]
Awards and honours[edit]

Grantham was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for philanthropic service to climate change research.[14]

Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. LLC


                  GMO, founded in 1977, is a privately held global investment management firm servicing clients in the corporate, public, endowment, and foundation marketplaces. As of December 31, 2012, we managed $106 billion* in client assets using a blend of traditional judgments with innovative quantitative methods to find undervalued securities and markets.

Our success in consistently providing value added performance across a broad range of asset classes is founded on several key factors that include: discipline, value orientation, investment research, and constant innovation (see GMO Qualities below). Our broad-based value added over benchmarks has led many of our clients to request that we allocate assets and advise them on a global scale

AXA Rosenberg Investment Management LLC


                  AXA Rosenberg Investment Management provides investment management services based on fundamental equity analysis using quantitative methods. The firm's investment approach is driven by bottom-up stock selection based on the rigorous fundamental analysis of company valuations and earnings combined with an understanding of both the stock specific and environmental risks that accompany this approach. AXA Rosenberg’s approach is applied globally and is implemented locally by experienced investment teams based in the US, Europe and Asia to create broadly diversified portfolios with a range of objectives from active equities (including enhanced index, large cap, small cap and “defensive equity income” type strategies) and \"\"SmartBeta\"\" strategies. The firm primarily invests in common stocks traded on the principal exchanges of major markets. The use of derivatives is currently not a strategic part of their investment approach. However, their goal is to be fully invested in equities at all times. As permitted, AXA Rosenberg may use stock index futures or ETFs to overlay cash or accruals and obtain exposure to the equity markets.

GMO proudly serves some of the most prestigious and sophisticated investors globally, focused on providing them with great investment results. We also work hard to partner with our clients by listening to them, answering their questions objectively, offering our insights proactively, finding ways in which we can add value for them, and following through on our commitments.  
Our client base is comprised primarily of institutions, including corporate and public defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans, endowments, foundations, and financial intermediaries.

GMO is a global investment leader with expertise in managing multi-asset class strategies as well as focused strategies in a number of specific asset classes. Our approach seeks to identify asset classes and securities for which we believe we can get paid to take risk and utilizes a long-term investment horizon, a belief in the power of mean reversion, discipline, conviction, and a commitment to research. We are willing to take bold, differentiated positions when opportunities warrant and have the patience and fortitude to invest with a long-term perspective. 
We have managed portfolios through multiple market cycles and we constantly re-examine market opportunities across asset classes, testing our assumptions and embracing changing market dynamics. We utilize this deep experience to construct portfolios that we believe will offer our clients superior investment results. We also leverage our proven expertise to develop unique, insightful market research and commentary for our clients. We succeed when our clients succeed.
