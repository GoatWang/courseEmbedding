I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN I ASKED MY DAD TO GIVE ME AWAY IN MY SECOND WEDDING.

Mrs Swyka
It was always a pleasure to serve you and Mr. Swyka at Agway, you both were always so pleasant.  We enjoyed customers like you.  In my travels, I saw that the saw blade at the end of your drive was missing, I knew Mr.  Swyka must have not been feeling well, it is the end of an Era.  
Best wished to you and your family,
We are sorry for your loss, they don't make them like that any more.

My Gig-gi was an intelligent man. The two things he would always ask me as soon as I said hello were "How's work treatin' you?" and "How are you doing in school?" The most important thing to him was to get the best education possible. His exact words that I will always live by are they can take away everything you have but they can't take away your education. You learn as much as you can so you can do whatever you want in life. He had only finished the 9th grade when he got pulled out of school to fight for our country, and I know for a fact that if he could, he would most definitely finish his high school education. However, he was such a gifted man for what knowledge he had. He taught himself a lot, such as how to create beautifully crafted wood pieces. I still have the rocking chair he made me when I was a little girl. This is why it was so heartwarming to see him smile the night of my graduation, he was proud of what I had done for him, even though he had done so much for me, his family, and our country. It was literally the least I could do.The stories he would share with all of us made for such a great laugh every now and again. My favorite will always be any story that involved his sly half-smirk that he would crack throughout telling his tale. We would only get a story when he was done his chores, with the help of my dad, and here recently his adopted grandson (my boyfriend, Matthew). He would always make sure his land, home, and his wife were all taken care of, no matter how much pain he was recently in. He worked as hard as he could up until a few days before the Lord called him up. I can only imagine him having a shot and a beer with God and all his war buddies having a grand celebration, looking over all the people he has made an impact on (which just so happened to be everyone that had the pleasure of meeting him).As I said my goodbye to him I could hear him say Yakshemash then I see him reaching his hand out for a firm handshake, followed by a

I grew up next door to the Swyka family. I saw first hand the wonderful man that he was and the relationships he had with his wife and children.  He was a very hard working man and took pride in his home, garden and everything else he did.  Even though my name is Penny...he always called me "Nickle".  Even when I saw him several years ago in the old Acme in Middletown when I asked him if he knew who I was...his answer with the great big smile of his..."Yes I do..your "Nickle".  I always thought the reason he called me that was because he thought I was worth more than a "Penny".  To the whole family...you are in my thoughts and prayers.  Keep all those great memories of him in your heart and he will always be with you.  Love to you all.

Nick and Millie were introduced to us when the local veterans of WWII were invited to a showing at Apex Piping of the  WWII Memorial Eagles which would be headed to Washington, D.C. for installation.  They instantly became not just an acquaintance, but also our friends.  
Both Nick and Millie have lived their lives with all of their priorities in order:  God first, their family second and everything else comes last.  Nick was a generous and gracious man who left his mark on you at your first introduction.   We will miss all the wonderful time we were able to spend when we would just "drop by" to visit.  There was always a warm welcome and many fun stories to share.
Here's to Nick until we meet again!  We will miss you.
Love and sympathy to every single one of the family.

My grandfather was the greatest man I ever knew.  I lived with him until I was three, and twice in college between boyfriends.  I stayed at his home every Thursday night, and every summer in between.  He drove me to school when I missed the bus, and picked me up from school if I was sick.  He helped me get an A in 6th grade history by coming to school and letting me interview him about the war, and in 9th grade English by helping me build a cemetery for Romeo and Juliet. He was always more than a grandfather to me.  He was a father, and in the end, the last thing he told me was how proud he was of the mother I'd become.

My grandfather always greeted me with a smile, a hug, and I know i will type it wrong... a Yakshamiesh... and if you didn't answer right..you got that look and then a smile.  I cherish every moment I spent with him and am honored to say that he was my Grandfather.  I will miss him dearly, but am so grateful for all the times we spent together.  Until we are reunited Gigi, you will always be in my heart!

Dad was a great Father, a constant teacher and a close friend. I feel so lucky that he was a part of my life for so long. He enjoyed time spent together more than anything. He gave everything and never asked for a thing in return. He loved laughter and enjoyed his shot and a beer. He was truly the salt of the earth.

When I think about dad, I think about a man that enjoyed simple things in life like nice weather to do a hard day's work in, a hot bowl of mom's chicken soup, a ride on the golf cart with Charlie, watching "Hee-Haw" and good conversation while having a shot and beer at the end of the day. If there was something he needed, a piece of furniture, a lamp, or a tool, he would much rather make it than buy it. He was an excellent carpenter, mechanic, electrician and plumber and strived for perfection in anything he had his hands in. One of his many great accomplishments was the beautiful home he built for his family without using drawings or power tools. Dad was such a hard worker, spending hours in the basement sharpening tools every evening after already putting in a hard day's work to earn a little extra money. He also received great satasfaction in passing on his knowledge, talents and wisdom to his children and grand children. He told so many interesting stories of his life before, during and after the war, yet I'm certain we didn't hear them all. He endured some very rough times throughout his life, times when there may have been no money, shoes or very little food, yet he still had fond memories of how he and his family found ways to get by. Rightfully so, there was a distinct proudness in his voice as he told stories of surviving those hard times. He was so arnry and loved practical jokes, even if it was one that ended up back-firing on him. One of my favorites was when he replaced the contents of a nearly empty bottle of scotch with some room temperature tea in preparation for our weekend shot and beer. He laughed so hard when he saw the reaction on my face to a sip of unsweetened tea instead fine scotch. I will never forget the laughter at that moment, nor will I forget the phone call I got on Wednesday evening of the following week when he proceeded to tell me that he dicided to have a shot and beer that day, forgetting all about the bottle that he had spiked with tea. I only wish I could have been there to  with him to share in the laughter when he realized that he tricked himself. He let you know when you made him proud and I can tell you from experience, it is one of the most rewarding feelings in the world to have earned the respect of such a great man, father and friend. We love you so much Dad!
