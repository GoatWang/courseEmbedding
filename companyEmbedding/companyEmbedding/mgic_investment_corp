Underwriting








				As mortgage professionals, our shared goal is to prudently qualify as many borrowers as possible so they can successfully maintain homeownership.
             





By carefully reviewing borrowers’ Credit, Capacity, Capital and Collateral (the Four Cs), we can piece together a comprehensive picture of risk. The presence of a high-risk factor in any one of these categories doesn’t necessarily threaten successful homeownership. But when a number of interrelated, high-risk characteristics are present without sufficient offsets or compensating factors, their cumulative effect dramatically increases the likelihood of default. The perspective we gain from evaluating the Four Cs gives us insight to loan quality. Underwriting for quality is an acquired art — not a cut-and-dried science. While there are general principles that apply, every loan file represents a unique situation.
Underwriting guides
Look to our Underwriting Guide and summaries for our most current Underwriting Requirements, which outline loan, borrower and property eligibility for mortgage insurance coverage and provide an overview of our underwriting philosophy.

Detecting Mortgage Fraud



Who Should Attend: Lenders
                                        Overview: Early fraud detection pays off for everyone. Mortgage fraud's damages cost money, time, energy and even relationships. How can you protect yourself and your company from it? Look for the red flags. Mortgage fraud costs the industry more than $1 billion a year, according to FBI estimates. It's not always easy to spot fraudulent activity, but you'll better protect yourself from potential losses by becoming familiar with some of the red flags that appear frequently in fraud cases. In this workshop, you'll learn to:• Understand what constitutes fraud, and when and where it's most likely to appear during the mortgage process.• Recognize geographic hot spots for fraud, as well as common schemes and motivations. • Keep an eye out for early fraud detection and prevention and identify red flags associated with potential fraud.• Understand your role in fraud prevention.

The formula for successful homeownership? Homebuyer education!

Some loan programs require homebuyer education. Consult with your lender to make sure you fulfill your homebuyer education requirements with an approved program.
Please note, our site does not fulfill Fannie Mae HomeReady® homebuyer education program requirements.

					Full Description



MGIC Investment Corporation, incorporated on June 21, 1984, is a holding company. The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides private mortgage insurance and ancillary services. The Company provides mortgage insurance to lenders throughout the United States and to government-sponsored entities to protect against loss from defaults on low-down payment residential mortgage loans. Its principal product is primary mortgage insurance. Through certain other non-insurance subsidiaries, the Company also provides various services for the mortgage finance industry, such as contract underwriting, analysis of loan originations and portfolios, and mortgage lead generation. The Company invests in sectors, such as corporate, tax-exempt municipals, taxable municipals, asset backed, Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pass-through certificates, escrowed/prerefunded municipals, United States treasuries, and equities and other. The Company's subsidiaries include Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC) and MGIC Indemnity Corporation (MIC).Mortgage InsuranceThe Company offers two principal types of private mortgage insurance: primary and pool. Primary insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure or sale approved by the Company (collectively, the claim amount). Primary insurance is generally written on first mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied single-family homes, which are one- to four-family homes and condominiums. Primary insurance can be written on first liens secured by non-owner occupied single-family homes, and on vacation or second homes. Primary coverage can be used on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument approved by the mortgage insurer. The borrower's mortgage loan instrument may require the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium. Most of its primary insurance in force (IIF) is borrower-paid mortgage insurance. Under the single premium plan, the borrower or lender pays in advance a single payment covering a specified term exceeding 12 months. Under the monthly premium plan, the borrower or lender pays a monthly premium payment to provide only one month of coverage. Under the annual premium plan, an annual premium is paid in advance, with annual renewal premiums paid in advance thereafter. Pool insurance is generally used as an additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers the amount of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if primary insurance is required on that mortgage loan, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan, which did not require primary insurance.Other Products and ServicesThe Company's contract underwriting services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance, as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. The Company provides various fee-based services for the mortgage finance industry, such as analysis of loan originations and portfolios, and mortgage lead generation.The Company competes with Arch Mortgage Insurance Company, Essent Guaranty, Inc., Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation and Radian Guaranty Inc.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Working with a Personal Financial Advisor
Whether you're new to investing or have been investing for years, you owe it to yourself to experience the difference of working with an Edward Jones financial advisor. Our firm is built to deliver personalized service, and we treat you with the respect you deserve. We've been doing it since 1922.
How we can help
We get it. Investing can be complicated. Ask all the questions you want, and we will answer them in plain English. Your financial advisor is your long-term financial partner. These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Are We Right for You?






Understands Me
I want to work with a financial advisor who really gets to know me and my family, our goals and what’s important to us.







Clearly Explains Investing
I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.







Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.







Meets on My Schedule
Meeting with my financial advisor should be convenient. And I want choices – whether that means meeting in person or over the phone.







Stays in Touch
I want my financial advisor to contact me to reassure me that I’m on the right track or make suggestions if I’m not. Even if I’m not expecting it.







Edward Jones & You
If these sound like qualities you’re looking for in a financial advisor, Edward Jones might be right for you.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!
