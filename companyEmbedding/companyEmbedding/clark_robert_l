                           worldwide
                           This book explores how rising pension and healthcare costs, along with workforce aging, are affecting pension and retirement
                              planning around the world. Many middle-aged workers now realize that they will have to work longer than intended, as they
                              begin to recognize that their retirement resources will be inadequate to finance retirement consumption. Volatile capital
                              markets, rising medical-care costs, and low saving rates make retirement behavior and policy a moving target. Olivia Mitchell,
                              executive director of The Pension Research Council at Wharton, and Robert L. Clark, Professor of Business Management and Economics
                              at North Carolina State University, explore these themes with colleagues, touching on a diverse set of issues ranging from
                              employment trends to pension accounting and investment, to retirement system overhaul. They illustrate how employers are actively
                              reformulating the meaning of work and retirement, seeking to encourage more people to work longer than ever before in the
                              face of projected labor shortages

                                 dimensions of public sector pensions from the colonial period until the emergence of modern retirement plans in the twentieth
                                 century. The authors emphasize how retirement plans can help achieve human resource objectives, how public sector pension
                                 policy has sometimes been influenced by other government objectives, and how early pension plans were funded."

                                 goals. This volume examines some of the most pressing employment and compensation issues confronting academic administrators."
                                 "This timely volume will appeal to academic administrators at colleges and universities in the US and internationally as they
                                 face the common challenges of rising employment costs, faculty again and global competition. Researchers interested in the

                              This fifteenth special report of the National Commission for Manpower Policy examines the interplay between the forces determining
                                 work schedules and the incidence and prevalence of unemployment. In the first chapter the author sets forth the major trends
                                 in hours of work and in the changing structure of the labor force that has led increasingly to families in which both spouses
                                 hold jobs. Chapter 2 focuses on how firms are likely to respond to changes in the demand for their products, both in periods
                                 of expansion and contraction, by altering their employment and hours of scheduling. Chapter 3 discusses existing public policies
                                 that influence the employment decisions of firms, including payroll taxes, fringe benefit policies, overtime legislation,
                                 and minimum wages. The fourth chapter discusses the potential influence of unemployment insurance, social security, private
                                 pension systems, and government fiscal policy on the labor supply. The sixth chapter briefly discusses jobs for the hard to
                                 employ labor force. The concluding chapter makes six policy recommendations to decrease the unemployment rate by encouraging
                                 a reduction in the hours of work and identifies areas where further research is needed. Cost calculations of reducing work
                                 hours and increasing the number of jobs are appended. (EM)

                              State and Local Retirement Plans in the United States explains how economic and political events have shaped the development
                                 of pension plans in the last century, and it argues that changes in the structure and generosity of these plans will continue
                                 to shape policy and funding in the future. It also brings to bear a new rationale to the policies behind public sector pension
                                 plans. The authors use the history of how early public pension plans were established, how they matured and how they have
                                 grown in generosity to analyse what changes may be expected in years to come. Unique in its scope, t

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Robert L. Clark can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
