ATLANTA, July 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Privet Fund Management LLC (together with its affiliates, "Privet"), the largest shareholder of Frequency Electronics, Inc. ("Frequency" or the "Company"), with ownership of just under 10% of the Company's outstanding common shares, today announced that it delivered a letter to the Company's CEO and copied the Board of Directors (the "Board").  In the letter, Privet discusses its attempts at constructive interaction with Company management and its frustration with the lack of any meaningful progress.  Privet states that, despite Frequency's development of mission critical products across many different client programs, shareholders have experienced a sustained period of share price underperformance.  








Privet also announced today that it submitted a letter to the Company dated July 5, 2016 nominating four highly-qualified director candidates for election to the Board at the Company's 2016 meeting.  Privet believes these candidates possess diverse skill sets directly relevant to Frequency's business and will effectively represent shareholders to drive sustainable value creation at Frequency.  Each director candidate's bio is included at the end of the below letter.  
Privet remains willing to pursue an open and constructive dialogue with management and the Board regarding all aspects of the Company's operations, corporate governance and opportunities to create value for shareholders.
The full text of Privet's letter is shown below:
July 5, 2016
Martin BlochFrequency Electronics55 Charles Lindbergh BlvdMitchel Field, NY 11553cc: Board of Directors
Dear Martin:
The purpose of this letter is to respond to your written communication to us following our most recent (fairly unproductive) series of discussions and to clearly articulate our view of the best path forward for the Company and its shareholders.  
BACKGROUND
Privet Fund LP, together with its affiliates, is the Company's largest shareholder, owning approximately 9.7% of the common stock of Frequency Electronics.  We have been shareholders of the Company for almost four years and believe that Frequency is deeply undervalued by the market.  During the course of our ownership, we have conducted extensive diligence pertaining to the Company, its products, its competitors and its end markets.  This analysis has led us to conclude that Frequency plays a critically important role for its customers across many different programs.  While we have determined that the Company's operations are inefficient and its capital discipline lacking, we believe that significant opportunities exist to create meaningful value that are within the control of management and the Board of Directors.
We are not the only shareholders who have been unable to realize any appreciation on our investment.  Over nearly every conceivable measurement period, Frequency's stock price has underperformed its peer group and the overall market by a significant margin.

RECENT HISTORY
In May 2015, news reports circulated stating that Frequency was possibly in the midst of a sale process.3  In response to these speculations, Privet pursued (and ultimately reached) an agreement with the Company that provided for the sharing of confidential information and board designation rights in exchange for a governance standstill for the 2015 Annual Meeting.  It was our hope that we would find it unnecessary to exercise our option to appoint someone to the board.  However, after closely observing and interacting with the Company, we are convinced that the incremental addition of just one board member is not sufficient for true value creation to occur at Frequency.    
As no favorable transaction has taken place in the period following our agreement, we have spent the past year observing firsthand the significant, tangible opportunities for corporate value creation that have not been clearly explored or, even more frustrating, have been ignored in favor of a singular focus on sales opportunities that have yet to materialize.  As one example, the act of promoting the Company's controller to replace the retiring CFO – while ignoring the multiple experienced financial professional candidates that we put forward – was an explicit endorsement of the status quo.  Additionally, demanding onerous confidentiality and standstill agreements as a condition to engaging with us to see if there was a basis for a shareholder friendly transaction further entrenched the present state of affairs.  We have great respect for your development and selling acumen, but if Frequency is going to succeed as a company – capable of delivering financial returns to its owners – rather than just a distinct product line, we believe real changes must be made. 
THE PATH FORWARD
We have maintained our significant ownership stake in the Company for multiple years for one reason: we believe Frequency is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to create value for shareholders that are within the control of management and the Board of Directors.  
As the Company's largest shareholder, we are highly incented to search for suitable solutions that can drive tangible value creation for shareholders.  We often encounter small public companies with a long-running disconnect between their market valuation and our estimate of intrinsic value.  Most of these companies believe they are managed better than they objectively are.  If one were to give a qualified and well-incented management team a desirable product and enough time, it would be reasonable to expect that company to grow in size and generate returns for shareholders.  As a contrast, in over 35 years of being public, Frequency has failed to grow into a larger company or generate any meaningful financial return.  In fact, the market currently values the entire enterprise at only $70 million – less than its tangible book value.  This is a frustration that should be shared by all Frequency stakeholders, especially management and the Board.
It is our belief that change is urgently needed on the Frequency Board.  The Company needs to drastically examine many facets of its business that we believe to be directly under the purview of the Board of Directors.  Further, we have seen no evidence of any sort of leadership and governance succession plan– a fact that we have continually called to your attention over the course of our ownership. We view this as a critical component of strategic planning for a founder-led company, still reliant on an (admittedly spry) 80-year-old CEO reporting to a Board with a median age of 80 and an average tenure of 27 years!  We question the independence of many of these directors and believe that some directors may have formed relationships over this time period that may render them unable to review managerial decisions and performance objectively or critically assess a broad range of alternatives.
Concurrent with this letter, please find our notice of nomination for the election of four director candidates: General Lance Lord, Ryan Levenson, James Henderson and Ben Rosenzweig.  We believe that each of these candidates brings a unique and relevant skill-set that can drive shareholder value creation at Frequency.  We are committed to maintaining Frequency's investments in mission critical components while simultaneously improving profitability by rigorously scrutinizing capital allocation decisions and taking decisive action where necessary.  We remain confident in the strategic value of the Company and believe that our candidates and involvement can bring about positive change.  
Our nominees have substantial experience operating and investing in many large and complex businesses, both within and outside the aerospace and defense sectors.  Given their experience, we believe our nominees are exceptionally qualified to represent shareholders by participating directly in the assessment and oversight of the Company's strategic plan.  We also believe our nominees possess the expertise, accountability and independence to help Frequency maximize shareholder returns.  
While we are disappointed that, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Frequency, we remain willing to continue engaging in discussions seeking a negotiated resolution.  However, we will not tolerate any maneuvers aimed at disenfranchising shareholders through delay or entrenchment.  We are resolute in our belief that meaningful board change is necessary to drive improved operational performance and we are prepared to exercise our rights as owners of the Company to achieve the qualified and independent oversight that shareholders deserve.
Best Regards,
Ryan Levenson and Ben RosenzweigPrivet Fund Management LLC

Strategy


Privet Fund Management LLC manages investment partnerships focused on making event-driven, value-oriented investments in small capitalization companies across all levels of the capital structure. Privetâs goal is to produce high long term absolute returns with low correlation to the broader markets.
Privet utilizes a research intensive approach, delving deep into business and situational fundamentals to identify low valuation investments tied to specific catalysts. Because of the exceptional knowledge threshold necessary to initiate investments, the Fund is run in a concentrated manner to ensure only the highest conviction positions influence 
	performance.
We believe that the "institutionalization" of the hedge fund industry has forced the vast majority of asset managers to myopically focus on liquidity and volatility management at the expense of returns. This dynamic has dramatically increased the number of companies for which informational asymmetry can be unearthed. In seeking to exploit this market inefficiency, the Fund targets small cap companies that have public market valuations significantly below our estimate of the private market value of the enterprises. Specific catalysts are identified or, if necessary, created that will drive convergence of public valuation and intrinsic value.

ATLANTA, March 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Privet Fund Management LLC (together with its affiliates, "Privet"), one of the largest shareholders of Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:   HDNG), with ownership of over 7.0% percent of the Company's outstanding common shares, today announced that it delivered a letter to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board").  In the letter, Privet outlines its significant concerns regarding the lack of accountability of management and the Board following a sustained period of both operational and share price underperformance.  Under Hardinge's current leadership, shareholder value continues to be destroyed through wasteful capital spending, a bloated operational footprint, entrenching governance practices and repeated financial underperformance.  Privet states that shareholders have lost confidence in the ability of Company leadership and that an independent, nationally-recognized investment bank should be retained to evaluate strategic alternatives in order to maximize shareholder value.
The full text of Privet's letter is shown below:
March 3, 2015
The Board of Directors
Hardinge Inc.
One Hardinge Drive
Elmira, NY 14902
Attn: Rick Simons, Chairman and CEO 
Dear Rick and Members of the Board of Directors (the "Board"),
Privet Fund Management LLC (together with its affiliates, "Privet") is one of the largest shareholders of Hardinge Inc. ("Hardinge" or the "Company"), owning approximately 7% of the Company's outstanding shares. We made our investment in Hardinge because we believe the Company is deeply undervalued by the market relative to the value of its assets and its competitive position within the machine tool industry.  Unfortunately, despite persistent opportunities for the Company to realize meaningful growth and profitability, Hardinge leadership has failed to create value for its shareholders over any reasonable time horizon.  
We believe that the Company's shareholders have a right to demand accountability from the stewards of their capital.  Shareholders have been more than patient in giving management and the Board repeated opportunities to demonstrate execution against communicated objectives.  Rather than taking decisive action to hold management accountable for years of empty promises and squandered capital spending, the Board has continued to plod along, tacitly approving mediocrity while putting virtually no personal capital at risk. 
Regrettably, it is too late for shareholders to believe any "action" or "plan" this Board may devise in response to our concerns.  At this point, we believe that the only way shareholders will feel that their interests are being truly considered is for the Board to immediately commence a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders.
A History of Underperformance
The Board of Directors and senior management team at Hardinge have been in place for a considerable amount of time.  Chairman/CEO Rick Simons has been at the Company since 1983 and has been a member of senior management since 1999.1 Of the six other directors, four have been on the Board for more than 11 years and three have been on the Board for over 20 years.  Over this same period of time, Hardinge shareholders have suffered through a sustained period of material underperformance.

We believe the primary reasons for this persistent underperformance have been management's poor record of capital allocation coupled with an inability to deliver upon stated financial goals.  With minimal senior leadership turnover during this period of substantial underperformance, shareholders are left to conclude that the Board is either incapable or unwilling to hold itself or management accountable.
Poor Track Record of Capital Allocation 
In late 2009, the Board was confronted with a proposal from Industrias Romi S.A. ("Romi") to purchase the Company for an all-cash price of $7.50-$8.00 per share.  That offer was summarily dismissed without any meaningful engagement by the Company or its advisors.  Even after Romi made its offer public and requested an open dialogue, the Board still did not engage with Romi or any other well-capitalized competitor in the hopes of procuring an acceptable price for shareholders, stating only that the Romi offer was "grossly inadequate" and "opportunistic."7 The Board's failure to get the most out of a potential acquirer by refusing to participate in discussions demonstrating the true value of the Company ultimately led Romi to bring its opening offer directly to Hardinge shareholders.  In spite of this, Romi raised its offer to $10.00 per share (a 105% premium over the Hardinge stock price when Romi first approached Hardinge), yet we could find no evidence that the Board engaged in a constructive dialogue.  In its public communications, management focused on highlighting previously enacted operational initiatives intended to increase the value of the Company, ostensibly to drive the share price well above the Romi offer over a reasonable period of time.   Unfortunately, neither these ambitious business goals nor the envisioned stock price appreciation have been achieved, while the nominal and opportunity costs have been borne by shareholders.
Using the May 2010 Romi tender offer of $10.00 as our commencement, we estimate Hardinge has spent $110 million in an attempt to grow the business through non-maintenance R&D, acquisitions and new facility construction in the five years following Romi's $117 million offer for the Company. That $110 million represents 75% of the Company's current market capitalization and 94% of the value offered to shareholders by Romi.

While the previous analysis compares the absolute value of the Company relative to the total amount reinvested in the business over the past five years, wasteful capital spending has coincided with roughly 10% shareholder dilution.  Examining the share price (the only metric that really matters) confirms that shareholders would have been better served by accepting the Romi offer and then redeploying those proceeds into nearly any other financial instrument.

Although the Company's filings did not disclose the internal forecasts and valuation metrics used by the Board and its financial advisor in concluding to reject the Romi offer, subsequent performance has led us to surmise that management is responsible for either preparing deeply flawed operating projections or failing to execute upon reasonable ones.  
No Accountability for Failed Financial Commitments 
The "2020 Vision" first presented to shareholders during the third quarter 2014 earnings call outlines ambitious goals (>$600 million revenue and $80 million of EBITDA) which, if achieved, should certainly create tremendous value for shareholders.  Our enthusiasm for the prosperous future is tempered by the repeated failure of current leadership to achieve publicly stated objectives.
In the April 2010 presentation in response to the Romi offer, management outlined a series of  performance results which Hardinge would be able to achieve "during any recovery" due to "key long-term value drivers" and the "actions taken during 2008 and 2009 to reduce costs."  These future results were presented to shareholders as a fait accompli and served as a significant component in the public basis for the rejection of the Romi offer.  We outline the individual performance goals and the subsequent actual outcomes below.
Goal: "Company believes 1% – 2% incremental EBITDA margin improvement, as compared with prior recovery periods, is attainable at higher sales volumes"

2011 and 2012 certainly represent a strong recovery period for the machine tool industry. Looking back at the 9%-10% margins achieved during 2006 and 2007, shareholders should have expected a minimum of 10%-11% margins, yet only saw 7.4% and 8.3%. These results give us little confidence in the "2020 Vision" promise of EBITDA margins of ~13%.

Hardinge temporarily achieved this goal, posting SG&A margins of 21.5% and 22.8% in 2011 and 2012, one to two points below pre-recession run-rates. However, we remain concerned about the transitory nature of this achievement as absolute levels of SG&A continue to steadily increase, irrespective of the total amount of sales.

There is no question that Hardinge operates within a cyclical industry and that 2009 was a business cycle trough.  Since that time, the Company has failed to effectively capitalize on the industry recovery while its peers have demonstrated consistent growth.
Unfortunately, the lack of accountability has not been confined to the results of the existing business.  The Company acquired Usach Technologies for $18.8 million in December 2012 in a transaction that management hailed as an "excellent extension of [Hardinge's] existing grinding machine product lines" and noted the potential for "significant marketing synergies for the Usach brands by leveraging [Hardinge's] existing channels in Asia… and into Europe."16  Since then, it is our understanding that the subsidiary has generated minimal returns outside of the EBITDA ($6.5 million in 2013) embedded in the substantial backlog at the time of acquisition, and that Usach's Elgin, IL facility remains one of the least utilized facilities in the Company's substantial footprint.  On top of the minimal incremental earnings power and redundant facility, Hardinge has taken cumulative impairments on this acquisition of $9.9 million, approximately half of the total purchase price.
Bloated Operational Footprint
Hardinge operates ten separate manufacturing facilities encompassing more than 1.2 million total square feet. While management is keen to emphasize the benefits of a "globally diverse sales and manufacturing platform,"17 there has been little mention of the detrimental financial impact of operating several significantly underutilized manufacturing facilities over extended periods of time. This inefficient operating model appears to be a meaningful reason SG&A expenses have risen from the $14 million per quarter estimate given in the April 2010 management presentation to the $21.5 million per quarter guidance given in management's most recent earnings call.  We find these numbers to be disappointing in light of the numerous opportunities management has had to recognize cost savings as a result of the Company's acquisitions.  Anecdotally, it appears that Hardinge has yet to close a facility it has acquired as part of a larger transaction during the past decade.  This does not seem to be a prudent strategy for maximizing the value of complementary businesses, especially as the Company's headquarters facility in Elmira, NY (a structure capable of housing more than eight football fields) continues to operate at a fraction of its overall capacity.
Based on the midpoint of management's statement that the current facility footprint has a capacity of $500-550 million of annual revenue,18 the Company would need to increase its sales by a staggering 60% in order to grow into its current facilities.  We find it highly implausible that operating out of a facility footprint that will, at a minimum, be significantly underutilized for the next six years even under the most aggressive assumptions is the optimal path to drive returns for shareholders.  
Misalignment of Interests: Shareholder Unfriendly Governance and Lack of Insider Ownership
Despite the Company's inability to create value for shareholders, Hardinge's classified Board and shareholder unfriendly corporate bylaws have helped to ensure that management and directors remain entrenched in their roles.  The ability of shareholders to influence the governance of their company is obstructed by the prohibition of the rights of shareholders to call special meetings or act by written consent.  Further, if shareholders were to attempt to obtain these rights, they would face an excessively high supermajority vote requirement in order to amend the Company's bylaws.  These artificial and antiquated restrictions limit the Board's accountability to shareholders and have created a culture of complacency that has permeated the ranks of management.
We are also very concerned by the lack of stock ownership by management and the Board in light of their collective tenure.  Collectively, the 11 Company insiders own 3.2% of the outstanding shares.19 However, upon further examination, it appears that an overwhelming portion of the reported insider ownership has been granted by the Company.  We went back to 2004 and analyzed every stock grant for both directors and executive officers in order to determine the true method of ownership of Hardinge shares.  It appears that a majority of directors and officers have either not purchased shares in the open market or have actually been net sellers in recent years.  In fact, the only open market purchases from current management and directors we observed over the past decade were Mr. Quain's acquisition of 1,000 shares in 2011 and Mr. Hunter's acquisition of 5,000 shares in 2008.  The vast majority of the reported "ownership" of insiders has come in the form of share grants rather than open market purchases.  
We believe that entrenched leadership coupled with minimal insider ownership and recurring stock grants has only served to widen the divide between the interests of the Company's operators and its true owners. Why should shareholders trust that the 2020 Vision (which would be expected to result in a "> $50 share price" by 202020) will be achieved when the managers and directors who set those very goals neither own significant amounts of Hardinge stock nor are willing to commit their own capital to purchase more?  
In light of the foregoing, it is clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable.  The current Board and management team have proven unworthy stewards of shareholder capital.  It is time for the Board to retain the services of a nationally recognized investment bank to conduct a fulsome evaluation of the Company's strategic alternatives.  This evaluation should be done objectively, weighing the certain premium value shareholders would receive if Hardinge was purchased by a third party against the future prospects of the Company in the hands of a capable, properly-incented Board and management team.  There is no other option — certainly not one that maintains the untenable state of repeated operational underperformance and continuous value transfer from shareholders to insiders.  Should the Board fail to uphold its fiduciary duties, we will seek to advance the interests of the owners of the Company by pursuing direct shareholder representation on the Hardinge Board.

Ryan Levenson and Ben Rosenzweig

Privet Fund LP Nominates a Slate of Highly Qualified Directors to the Board of Frequency Electronics

Believes the Company is Deeply Undervalued and a Reconstituted Board is Required to Drive Shareholder Value Creation
Questions Independence and Succession Plan of Board with Median Age of 80 and Average Tenure of 27 Years
Nominates Slate of Highly Qualified Candidates with Directly Relevant Backgrounds for Election at Frequency's 2016 Annual Meeting




Jul 5, 2016, 4:02pm EDT














ATLANTA, July 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Privet Fund Management LLC (together with its affiliates, "Privet"), the largest shareholder of Frequency Electronics, Inc. ("Frequency" or the "Company"), with ownership of just under 10% of the Company's outstanding common shares, today announced that it delivered a letter to the Company's CEO and copied the Board of Directors (the "Board").  In the letter, Privet discusses its attempts at constructive interaction with Company management and its frustration with the lack of any meaningful progress.  Privet states that, despite Frequency's development of mission critical products across many different client programs, shareholders have experienced a sustained period of share price underperformance.  
Privet also announced today that it submitted a letter to the Company dated July 5, 2016 nominating four highly-qualified director candidates for election to the Board at the Company's 2016 meeting.  Privet believes these candidates possess diverse skill sets directly relevant to Frequency's business and will effectively represent shareholders to drive sustainable value creation at Frequency.  Each director candidate's bio is included at the end of the below letter.  
Privet remains willing to pursue an open and constructive dialogue with management and the Board regarding all aspects of the Company's operations, corporate governance and opportunities to create value for shareholders.
The full text of Privet's letter is shown below:

Dear Martin:
The purpose of this letter is to respond to your written communication to us following our most recent (fairly unproductive) series of discussions and to clearly articulate our view of the best path forward for the Company and its shareholders.  
BACKGROUND
Privet Fund LP, together with its affiliates, is the Company's largest shareholder, owning approximately 9.7% of the common stock of Frequency Electronics.  We have been shareholders of the Company for almost four years and believe that Frequency is deeply undervalued by the market.  During the course of our ownership, we have conducted extensive diligence pertaining to the Company, its products, its competitors and its end markets.  This analysis has led us to conclude that Frequency plays a critically important role for its customers across many different programs.  While we have determined that the Company's operations are inefficient and its capital discipline lacking, we believe that significant opportunities exist to create meaningful value that are within the control of management and the Board of Directors.
We are not the only shareholders who have been unable to realize any appreciation on our investment.  Over nearly every conceivable measurement period, Frequency's stock price has underperformed its peer group and the overall market by a significant margin.

RECENT HISTORY
In May 2015, news reports circulated stating that Frequency was possibly in the midst of a sale process.3  In response to these speculations, Privet pursued (and ultimately reached) an agreement with the Company that provided for the sharing of confidential information and board designation rights in exchange for a governance standstill for the 2015 Annual Meeting.  It was our hope that we would find it unnecessary to exercise our option to appoint someone to the board.  However, after closely observing and interacting with the Company, we are convinced that the incremental addition of just one board member is not sufficient for true value creation to occur at Frequency.    
As no favorable transaction has taken place in the period following our agreement, we have spent the past year observing firsthand the significant, tangible opportunities for corporate value creation that have not been clearly explored or, even more frustrating, have been ignored in favor of a singular focus on sales opportunities that have yet to materialize.  As one example, the act of promoting the Company's controller to replace the retiring CFO – while ignoring the multiple experienced financial professional candidates that we put forward – was an explicit endorsement of the status quo.  Additionally, demanding onerous confidentiality and standstill agreements as a condition to engaging with us to see if there was a basis for a shareholder friendly transaction further entrenched the present state of affairs.  We have great respect for your development and selling acumen, but if Frequency is going to succeed as a company – capable of delivering financial returns to its owners – rather than just a distinct product line, we believe real changes must be made. 
THE PATH FORWARD
We have maintained our significant ownership stake in the Company for multiple years for one reason: we believe Frequency is deeply undervalued and that meaningful opportunities exist to create value for shareholders that are within the control of management and the Board of Directors.  
As the Company's largest shareholder, we are highly incented to search for suitable solutions that can drive tangible value creation for shareholders.  We often encounter small public companies with a long-running disconnect between their market valuation and our estimate of intrinsic value.  Most of these companies believe they are managed better than they objectively are.  If one were to give a qualified and well-incented management team a desirable product and enough time, it would be reasonable to expect that company to grow in size and generate returns for shareholders.  As a contrast, in over 35 years of being public, Frequency has failed to grow into a larger company or generate any meaningful financial return.  In fact, the market currently values the entire enterprise at only $70 million – less than its tangible book value.  This is a frustration that should be shared by all Frequency stakeholders, especially management and the Board.
It is our belief that change is urgently needed on the Frequency Board.  The Company needs to drastically examine many facets of its business that we believe to be directly under the purview of the Board of Directors.  Further, we have seen no evidence of any sort of leadership and governance succession plan– a fact that we have continually called to your attention over the course of our ownership. We view this as a critical component of strategic planning for a founder-led company, still reliant on an (admittedly spry) 80-year-old CEO reporting to a Board with a median age of 80 and an average tenure of 27 years!  We question the independence of many of these directors and believe that some directors may have formed relationships over this time period that may render them unable to review managerial decisions and performance objectively or critically assess a broad range of alternatives.
Concurrent with this letter, please find our notice of nomination for the election of four director candidates: General Lance Lord, Ryan Levenson, James Henderson and Ben Rosenzweig.  We believe that each of these candidates brings a unique and relevant skill-set that can drive shareholder value creation at Frequency.  We are committed to maintaining Frequency's investments in mission critical components while simultaneously improving profitability by rigorously scrutinizing capital allocation decisions and taking decisive action where necessary.  We remain confident in the strategic value of the Company and believe that our candidates and involvement can bring about positive change.  
Our nominees have substantial experience operating and investing in many large and complex businesses, both within and outside the aerospace and defense sectors.  Given their experience, we believe our nominees are exceptionally qualified to represent shareholders by participating directly in the assessment and oversight of the Company's strategic plan.  We also believe our nominees possess the expertise, accountability and independence to help Frequency maximize shareholder returns.  
While we are disappointed that, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Frequency, we remain willing to continue engaging in discussions seeking a negotiated resolution.  However, we will not tolerate any maneuvers aimed at disenfranchising shareholders through delay or entrenchment.  We are resolute in our belief that meaningful board change is necessary to drive improved operational performance and we are prepared to exercise our rights as owners of the Company to achieve the qualified and independent oversight that shareholders deserve.
Best Regards,
Ryan Levenson and Ben RosenzweigPrivet Fund Management LLC
