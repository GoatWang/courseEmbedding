About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Robert and Michele O'Shea — Inside Philanthropy
































































































Wall Street Donors Guide























































May 19, 2017

Robert and Michele O'Shea

May 19, 2017/



Ade Adeniji



NET WORTH: Unknown
SOURCE OF WEALTH: Goldman Sachs; Silver Point Capital
FUNDING AREAS: New Jersey Community, Education, Health
OVERVIEW: Robert J. O'Shea and his wife Michele move their philanthropy through the O'Shea Family Foundation, through which the couple has been especially focused on the New Jersey community where they live, bankrolling human service, youth, and other outfits. The O'Sheas have also strongly supported their alma mater, Fordham University. Michele, a life coach and yoga instructor, also motivates the couple's interest in yoga and integrative medicine. 
BACKGROUND: Robert J. O'Shea graduated from Fordham University's College of Business Administration in 1987. O'Shea served senior positions with Bear Stearns and Security Pacific Merchant Bank before joining Goldman Sachs, where he made partner in 1994. In 2002, O'Shea co-founded the Greenwich, Connecticut-headquartered Silver Point Capital with fellow Goldman alum Edward A. Mule. 
ISSUES:
NEW JERSEY COMMUNITY: The O'Sheas are based in New Jersey and the couple's charitable vehicle directs money to a number of New Jersey outfits. A sampling of recent grantees includes Breezy Point Disaster Relief Fund, an outfit established after Superstorm Sandy; Two Towns Charity, a nonprofit "founded with the hopes of healing children in the North Rockland Community"; Oasis, whose mission is "to change the lives of women and children by breaking the cycle of poverty through compassionate programs designed to feed, clothe, educate and empower women and children in need"; Wyckoff Parks and Recreation Foundation; Community Food Bank of New Jersey; Friends of Wyckoff Library; Wyckoff Volunteer Ambulance Corps; and Flow Follies, the "largest Scholarship Fundraiser for the Ramapo Indian Hills Regional High School District."
EDUCATION: Both O'Shea and his wife Michele are Fordham University graduates, as is at least one of their kids. O'Shea has also served on the board of trustees at Fordham. In a recent fiscal year, Fordham University received a $1.1 million grant from the O'Sheas through their foundation. The couple has also supported Fordham Preparatory School, Montclair Kimberly Academy, and Bergen Catholic High School, among other schools.
HEALTH: Michele O'Shea lists "health" as an interest area on her Linkedin profile, along with "children" and "animal welfare." She certainly plays a role in the couple's philanthropy as a life coach and yoga teacher who is committed to health and wellness. The couple created a program for nurses at Valley Hospital to educate them on "holistic practices for enhancing their own well-being." They've also collaborated with a yoga outfit called Kula for Karma to integrate therapeutic yoga and meditation programs for cardiac and cancer patients at Valley Hospital. Integrative medicine appears key for this funder. The couple has also supported outfits such as Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, American Cancer Society, Christian Healthcare Center, American Red Cross of Northern New Jersey, and St. Jude's Hospital.
OTHER: Outside New Jersey, the couple has recently funded youth outfits such as Save the Children and Right to Play. The couple has given steady support to Heifer International of late, an organization "working to end hunger and poverty around the world by providing livestock and training to struggling communities."
LOOKING FORWARD: Only in his 50s, Robert O'Shea is still very much engaged in business,  but he and his wife Michele should be watched for greater giving down  the line. One area to keep an eye on in particular is integrative medicine.
