About Us

HomeAbout Us 







TOMI™ Environmental Solutions, Inc.
TOMI™ Environmental Solutions, Inc. is a leading provider of infection prevention and decontamination products and services, focused primarily on life sciences including healthcare, bio-safety, pharmaceutical, clean-room and research. Our mission is to help our customers create a healthier world through TOMI’s product line. TOMI’s motto is “Innovating for a Safer World” for healthcare and life.
As a global decontamination and infectious disease control company, TOMI™ provides environmental solutions for indoor and outdoor surface decontamination through the sale of equipment, services and licensing of our SteraMist™ Binary Ionization Technology® (BIT™) which is a EPA registered hydrogen peroxide based mist and fog.
During August 2010, TOMI™ entered into negotiations to purchase the assets of a U.S. Defense company’s division that owned and operated BIT™. The technology was a division of L-3 Applied Technologies, Inc. (L-3). In April 2013, we completed the acquisition of certain assets from L-3 for $3,510,000 and TOMI™ began to develop, engineer and complete regulatory testing for the EPA registrations of BIT™ and BIT™ Solution as a Hospital-Healthcare Disinfectant.  BIT™  is the platform that runs our SteraMist™ equipment that currently accounts for nearly all of our revenue.
TOMI™ re-engineered the prototypes into TOMI’s current model of Binary Ionization Technology® (BIT™), branded as SteraMist™. This technology was developed for the neutralization of anthrax spores and sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  This novel DARPA project was sanctioned under DARPA/CMO Contract No. MDA972-03-C-0092 and developed through the Special Projects Office/SPO.: Immune Building DARPA Order No. P896/00 Program Code: 3310 3701 North Fairfax Drive Arlington, VA 22203-1714.
In June 2015, SteraMist™ BIT™ was granted a registration from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant for use as a misting/fogging agent (EPA Registration 90150-2). Our product also holds a second EPA registration for mold control and air & surface remediation (EPA Registration 90150-1).
 
SteraMist™ Binary Ionization Technology® (BIT™)
BIT™ was developed in response to Amerithrax, the anthrax attacks that occurred in Washington, D.C. shortly after the September 11,2001 US terrorist attacks.  It is a patented two-step process that aerosolizes and activates a low concentration hydrogen peroxide solution producing a fine aqueous mist that contains a high concentration of Reactive Oxidative Species (ROS), mostly hydroxyl radicals. ROS cause damage to pathogenic organisms via mechanisms such as oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids such as carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids leading to cellular disruption and/or dysfunction. The unique alteration of the chemistry of our solution occurs after passing our EPA registered BIT™ Solution through our atmospheric high voltage cold plasma arc which causes the breaking of the double bond of a hydrogen peroxide molecule.  The net result is the hydroxyl radical. This hydroxyl radical is known as Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (AIHP). The TOMI™ patented process allows these ROS (hydroxyl radicals) to exist in high concentrations without rapidly recombining and losing their reactivity.
Testing detailed by DARPA demonstrates these ROS, which include the hydroxyl ion and hydroxyl radicals, aggressively break the double bonds in bacterial spores, biological and Chemical warfare agents (BWA and CWA) neutralizing their threat and producing non-toxic by-products.
Brought to the commercial market by TOMI™ in June 2013, our current suite of products includes the SteraMist™ Surface Unit, the SteraMist™ Environment System, and BIT™ Solution. Our SteraMist™ BIT™ platform has expanded beyond the initial chemical and biological warfare applications to deactivate problem microorganisms (including spores) in healthcare, laboratory, clean rooms, and a wide variety of other commercial and residential settings. SteraMist™ BIT™ provides fast acting biological deactivation and works in even the most hard-to-reach areas while leaving no residue or noxious fumes. The by-products produced by SteraMist™ BIT™ are oxygen and humidity.
The SteraMist™ Surface Unit is a fully portable fast-acting, hand held, point and spray disinfection/decontamination system. It is a safe and easy process to make certain that your facility, home, and assets are disinfected/decontaminated to the maximum extent possible. The single applicator Surface Unit enables disinfection of all surfaces–including high touch, sensitive medical equipment, and electronics. The space is safe to re-enter within minutes after the Activated Ionized Hydrogen Peroxide (AIHP) mist has been applied. The EPA registered 5-second application time AND 7-minute contact time seamlessly results in quick room turnover while eliminating pathogens such as MRSA and H1N1.
TOMI’s SteraMist™ Surface Unit is lightweight, easy to transport, and capable of achieving reliable disinfection/decontamination as it is easily incorporated into current cleaning procedures and protocols. The hydroxyl radicals produced by TOMI’s plasma science does not require heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems to be shut down and requires no wiping, leaves no residue and is a bleach, chlorine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, titanium dioxide, peracetic and silver ion free formula.
The SteraMist™ Environment System is a transportable remotely controlled system that provides complete room disinfection/decontamination of a sealed space, up to 103.8 m3 (3,663 ft3). Individually, each remote applicator can be used to treat a space of approximately 34.6 m3 (1,221 ft3). Multiple Environment Systems can be used simultaneously to accommodate larger spaces. Fast application = minimal down time. Mechanical cleaning that makes whole room disinfecting/decontaminating easier. With this automated touch-less application solution you can treat multiple areas simultaneously. Our hybrid technology – applicators can be used in manual and/or fogging modes. Great for frequent daily use, saves time and labor.  SteraMist™ is a powerful technology in fighting, reducing and eliminating bacteria including C. diff spores and when you reenter the room you can “smell the clean”
TOMI™ currently targets domestic and international markets. Our approach to the international markets is through strategic partners, manufacturer representatives,/or and licensed distribution partners. The company is currently focused in Mexico and Central America, the EU, and Asia where the technology is used for the control of microorganisms and the decontamination of large and small indoor space for biological pathogens and chemical agents. Domestically, TOMI’s primary market is Healthcare-Hospitals, Biosafety, and Pharmaceutical along with many other verticals that TOMI sells to end-users or end-user can elect to have the areas treated through the TOMI Service Network (TSN), a network professional service providers. These include infectious diseases in hospitals, bio-secure labs, pharmaceutical, biodefense, and biosafety facilities – including isolation and transfer chambers, tissue banks, food safety, and many other commercial and residential settings.
TOMI™ has extensive experience in developing training programs and application protocols for its clients and is a member in good standing with The American Biological Safety Association, The American Association of Tissue Banks, Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, The Restoration Industry Association, Indoor Air Quality Association, and The International Ozone Association.
