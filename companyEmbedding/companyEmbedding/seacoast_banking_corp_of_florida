The term “qualified medical expenses” means amounts paid for the medical care, as defined in Section 213(d) of the Code, of yourself, your legal spouse, or your qualified dependents (as defined in Code Section 223), but only to the extent such amounts are not compensated by insurance or otherwise. This includes amounts paid for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body, as well as for transportation primarily for and essential to such care. Qualified medical expenses do not include insurance premiums other than premiums for long-term care insurance, premiums on a health plan during any period of continuation coverage required by federal law (e.g., “COBRA” coverage), premiums for health care coverage while an individual receives unemployment compensation, or premiums paid for any health coverage that you maintain once you attain age 65 (including Medicare Part B premiums) other than premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap).

                Margie Manning            








 



Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida has signed a $71.2 million deal to acquire Palm Beach Community Bank, the second-largest bank based in Palm Beach County.
Stuart-based Seacoast (Nasdaq: SBCF) had $4.8 billion in assets and $3.7 billion in deposits on March 31. The deal would increase its assets by 7 percent to $5.03 billlion.

West Palm Beach-based Palm Beach Community Bank has $281 million in deposits in four branches and $290 million in loans.




So it would be a significant boost in market share for Seacoast, which had five Palm Beach County branches with $410 million in deposits as of June 30, 2016, according to the FDIC. It also had a loan production office in Fort Lauderdale.
"This is a compelling acquisition that expands our footprint in Palm Beach County, part of Florida's largest MSA," said Dennis S. Hudson III, Seacoast chairman and CEO. "The acquisition of Palm Beach Community Bank increases our market share and gives current and prospective Palm Beach customers immediate access to our products and services, delivered by our knowledgeable local team as well as mobile and online banking, our 24/7 local call center and access to the Publix ATM network.
Palm Beach Community Bank was founded in 2008. It increased 45 percent in asset size over the past three years and had relatively few noncurrent loans. It posted a $5.6 million profit in 2016.




 


"Our customers will benefit from our combination with Seacoast, a successful community bank with strong local roots," said Cal Cearley, CEO of Palm Beach Community Bank. "Seacoast's well-established brand, commitment to the communities it serves, and wide range of mobile and digitally enabled products makes them an ideal partner."
The banks said the deal is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. After the deal closes, Palm Beach County would be left with eight local banks.
Under the proposed deal, each share of Palm Beach Community Bank would be exchange for 0.9809 of a share of SBCF as long as it trades between $21 and $22.75 per share, plus $6.33 in cash. If SBCF shares increase above $22.75 or below $21 per share, the exchange ratio in the merger would be adjusted to compensate.
FIG Partners was the financial advisor and Alston & Bird were the legal counsel for Seacoast in the deal. Palm Beach Community Bank received financial advise from Sandler O'Neill & Partners and legal counsel from Holland & Knight.

Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida
 


 

 




 





 


STUART, Fla., Nov. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida ("Seacoast") (NASDAQ:   SBCF), the holding company for Seacoast National Bank ("Seacoast Bank"), announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Floridian Financial Group, Inc. ("Floridian"), the parent company of Floridian Bank.  Upon completion of the merger, Seacoast expects that Floridian Bank will be merged with and into Seacoast Bank.
Floridian, headquartered in Lake Mary, Florida, currently operates 10 branches in Orlando and Daytona Beach and will add approximately $426 million in assets, $361 million in deposits, and $289 million in gross loans to Seacoast. Floridian has successfully executed a customer- and relationship-driven growth strategy, resulting in a stable deposit franchise and an attractive commercial loan production network. Approximately 86% of Floridian's total deposits consist of low-cost core deposit accounts, with 33% of total deposits in transaction accounts. 
This acquisition is Seacoast's third in the attractive and fast-growing Orlando MSA. Seacoast acquired Winter Park-based BankFIRST in 2014 and announced its pending acquisition of BMO Harris' franchise in Orlando on October 15, 2015.  The acquisitions of Floridian and the BMO Harris branches strengthen Seacoast's position as a leading Florida-based community bank.
Dennis S. Hudson, Seacoast's Chairman and CEO, said, "This transaction is consistent with our strategy of combining organic growth with accretive acquisitions. With the pending acquisition of the BMO Harris branch franchise and now Floridian, Seacoast is expanding our franchise and building on our previous momentum in Orlando and Florida overall. Greater Orlando's vibrant economy continues to diversify, with strong gains in employment due to significant growth from companies in the high tech, healthcare and life science fields."
"We are delighted to welcome Floridian's nearly 5,500 customers and their employees to Seacoast Bank, and look forward to providing the customers of Floridian with a broader array of banking services, including expanded commercial and mortgage lending capabilities, and welcoming Floridian's customers and associates to Seacoast," Hudson added.
Thomas Dargan, Jr., Floridian's President and CEO, said, "Our combination with Seacoast creates value for our customers and shareholders by combining two strong and complementary banks with a shared commitment to customer service and their communities. We look forward to the additional products and services that Seacoast will bring to our customers and the long-term value this transaction creates for our shareholders."
Hudson noted that Tom Dargan will join Seacoast as Market Executive for Volusia County. "Tom's impressive career in community banking makes him an excellent partner for our organization," Hudson said.
Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Floridian shareholders will have the right to receive, at their election, (i) the combination of $4.29 in cash and 0.5291 shares of Seacoast common stock, (ii) $12.25 in cash or (iii) 0.8140 shares of Seacoast common stock, subject to a customary proration mechanism so that the aggregate consideration mix equals 35% cash and 65% Seacoast shares (based on Seacoast's ten-day average closing price of $15.05 per share as of October 29, 2015).  This values Floridian's shares at $12.25 per share, for a total transaction value of approximately $76.5 million.  The transaction price represents a 1.4x multiple to Floridian's tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2015.
Seacoast expects the acquisition to be $0.02 accretive to 2016 earnings per share and $0.07- $0.09 accretive in 2017 and beyond.  The transaction is $0.34 dilutive to tangible book value per common share, including restructuring charges, with an earn-back of approximately 4.2 years using the crossover method. Following this transaction and the previously announced branch acquisition from BMO Harris, Seacoast will continue to exceed the well-capitalized guidelines. 
The Boards of Directors of both Seacoast and Floridian Financial have unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, and is subject to approval by Floridian's shareholders, receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Seacoast is being advised by FBR Capital Markets & Co. as financial advisor and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP as legal counsel.  Floridian is being advised by Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. as financial advisor and Gunster, Yoakley & Stewart, P.A. as legal counsel. 
Investor Conference Call
Seacoast will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 3, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the merger. Investors may call in (toll-free) by dialing (888) 517-2458 (passcode: 8678 602#; host: Dennis S. Hudson). Alternatively, individuals may listen to the live webcast of the conference call by visiting Seacoast's website at www.SeacoastBanking.net. The link is located in the subsection "Presentations" under the heading "Investor Services." Beginning the afternoon of November 3, 2015, an archived version of the webcast can be accessed from this same subsection of the website. The archived webcast will be available for one year.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
