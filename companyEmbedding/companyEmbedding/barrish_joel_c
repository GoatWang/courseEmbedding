Achillion Appoints Dr. Joel Barrish as Chief Scientific Officer

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Jan.  04, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACHN) today announced that Joel Barrish, Ph.D., has been named the Company's Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) and Executive Vice President, effective January 4, 2016. "It is with great excitement that we welcome Joel to Achillion as CSO," commented Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. "Joel is a highly accomplished drug hunter who has co-invented and developed multiple clinical compounds, including the highly successful marketed therapeutic Sprycel for which he received The Thomas Alva Edison Award. Most recently, Joel served as the Vice President and Head of Discovery Chemistry for all therapeutic areas, including Immunology, at Bristol-Myers Squibb. We look forward to him continuing his work to address the needs of patients by stewarding Achillion's expanding portfolio of complement factor D inhibitors including ACH-4471 which is poised to enter clinical development." Dr. Barrish commented, "Achillion is an exciting and innovative company whose discovery and development achievements have impressed me for many years. I am delighted to join an exceptional team and share in this unique opportunity to advance Achillion's Complement inhibitor platform. I believe that ACH-4471 and the ongoing discovery efforts related to factor D inhibition represent significant potential to address unmet needs, not only for patients with ultra-rare diseases, but as potentially improved treatment options for ophthalmic, respiratory and other broad indications." Joel C. Barrish, Ph.D.  Dr. Barrish joins Achillion with more than 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry. For the last five years, Dr. Barrish was Vice President and Head of Discovery Chemistry at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), leading chemical research on small molecules and other modalities across all therapeutic areas and sites. Prior to that role, he was responsible for teams at BMS that advanced more than 20 compounds into clinical development including SPRYCEL® (dasatinib), a marketed kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which he co-invented. He and his co-inventors received the 2008 Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award for its discovery. Dr. Barrish has co-authored over 120 peer-reviewed publications, is a co-inventor on more than 35 issued U.S. patents, and has been invited to give more than 40 lectures at international conferences and universities. In 2010, Dr. Barrish was elected to the Executive Committee of the American Chemical Society Medicinal Chemistry Division and served as its Chair in 2013. He was named an American Chemical Society Fellow in 2012. Dr. Barrish is also a Scientific Advisory Board member for the chemistry departments at the University of Pennsylvania and at Rutgers University. Dr. Barrish graduated summa cum laude in Chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania and received a doctorate in Organic Chemistry from Columbia University.   About Achillion Pharmaceuticals Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN) is a science-driven, patient-focused company seeking to leverage its strengths across the continuum from discovery to commercialization in its goal of providing better treatments for people with serious diseases.

Small Molecule Reversible Inhibitors of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK): Structure–Activity Relationships Leading to the Identification of 7-(2-Hydroxypropan-2-yl)-4-[2-methyl-3-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-3-yl)phenyl]-9 H -carbazole-1-carboxamide (BMS-935177)



De Lucca, George V.
						; Shi, Qing
						; Liu, Qingjie
						; ... September 2016 - Journal of Medicinal Chemistry


Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) belongs to the TEC family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and plays a critical role in multiple cell types responsible for numerous autoimmune diseases. This article will detail the structure–activity relationships (SARs) leading to a novel second generation series of potent and selective reversible carbazole inhibitors of BTK. With an excellent pharmacokinetic profile as well as demonstrated in vivo activity and an acceptable safety profile, 7-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-4-[2-methyl-3-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-3-yl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole-1-carboxamide 6 (BMS-935177) was selected to advance into clinical development.

Discovery of 4-(5-(Cyclopropylcarbamoyl)-2-methylphenylamino)-5-methyl-N-propylpyrrolo[1,2-f][1,2,4]triazine-6-carboxamide (BMS-582949), a Clinical p38[alpha] MAP Kinase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases



Liu, Chunjian
						; Lin, James
						; Wrobleski, Stephen T.
						; ... November 2013 - J. Med. Chem.


The discovery and characterization of 7k (BMS-582949), a highly selective p38{alpha} MAP kinase inhibitor that is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is described. A key to the discovery was the rational substitution of N-cyclopropyl for N-methoxy in 1a, a previously reported clinical candidate p38{alpha} inhibitor. Unlike alkyl and other cycloalkyls, the sp{sup 2} character of the cyclopropyl group can confer improved H-bonding characteristics to the directly substituted amide NH. Inhibitor 7k is slightly less active than 1a in the p38{alpha} enzymatic assay but displays a superior pharmacokinetic profile and, as such, was moremore » effective in both the acute murine model of inflammation and pseudoestablished rat AA model. The binding mode of 7k with p38{alpha} was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.« less

5-Amino-pyrazoles as potent and selective p38[alpha] inhibitors



Das, Jagabandhu
						; Moquin, Robert V.
						; Dyckman, Alaric J.
						; ... February 2012 - Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.


The synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of p38{alpha} MAP kinase inhibitors based on a 5-amino-pyrazole scaffold are described. These studies led to the identification of compound 2j as a potent and selective inhibitor of p38{alpha} MAP kinase with excellent cellular potency toward the inhibition of TNF{alpha} production. Compound 2j was highly efficacious in vivo in inhibiting TNF{alpha} production in an acute murine model of TNF{alpha} production. X-ray co-crystallography of a 5-amino-pyrazole analog 2f bound to unphosphorylated p38{alpha} is also disclosed.

Design, Synthesis, and Anti-inflammatory Properties of Orally Active 4-(Phenylamino)-pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine p38[alpha] Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Inhibitors



Hynes, Jr., John
						; Dyckman, Alaric J.
						; Lin, Shuqun
						; ... June 2008 - J. Med. Chem.


A novel structural class of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors consisting of substituted 4-(phenylamino)-pyrrolo[2,1- f][1,2,4]triazines has been discovered. An initial subdeck screen revealed that the oxindole-pyrrolo[2,1- f][1,2,4]triazine lead 2a displayed potent enzyme inhibition (IC 50 60 nM) and was active in a cell-based TNFalpha biosynthesis inhibition assay (IC 50 210 nM). Replacement of the C4 oxindole with 2-methyl-5- N-methoxybenzamide aniline 9 gave a compound with superior p38 kinase inhibition (IC 50 10 nM) and moderately improved functional inhibition in THP-1 cells. Further replacement of the C6 ester of the pyrrolo[2,1- f][1,2,4]triazine with amides afforded compounds with increased potency, excellentmore » oral bioavailability, and robust efficacy in a murine model of acute inflammation (murine LPS-TNFalpha). In rodent disease models of chronic inflammation, multiple compounds demonstrated significant inhibition of disease progression leading to the advancement of 2 compounds 11b and 11j into further preclinical and toxicological studies.« less
