Low Oil Prices May Force Bankruptcies In Energy Companies

Low Oil Prices May Force Many Companies Into Bankruptcy. You Could Recover Your Investment Losses. 


In a recent article in Reuters, they state that analysts at Wells Fargo Securities wrote that oil prices below $40 per barrel are not sustainable for most producers and high cost structures are expected to push more oil producers into restructurings or bankruptcies in the next 12-18 months.
Call Our Securities Lawyers To File Your Claim Today If Your Loss is Due To Your Broker: 1-888-760-6552
For several producers, break-even levels are at about $60 per barrel, almost double the current crude prices. The analysts added that the oil price curve implies that crude is unlikely to rise above $60 per barrel for at least the next 10 years.
A slump in oil prices could force more companies into bankruptcies, but production is not expected to decrease significantly as field-level cash operating costs for most producers is well below $20 per barrel.  Low oil prices have exposed negligence by many stock brokers that over-concentrated positions in the oil and gas sector.  If you lost money due to your broker’s investment advice in oil please call Soreide Law Group at 1-888-760-6552 for a free consultation with a lawyer.  No fees if no recovery, Soreide Law Group advances all costs.
Below is a table of levered break-even prices per barrel of some of the West Texas Intermediate crude for U.S. companies :
$40 and below 
Diamondback Energy Inc
RSP Permian Inc
Concho Resources Inc
Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc
Whiting Petroleum Corp
Newfield Exploration Co
$40 and Above
Bill Barrett Corp Rex Energy Corp Denbury Resources Inc Resolute Energy Corp Clayton Williams Energy Inc Breitburn Energy Partners LP QEP Resources Inc Linn Energy LLC California Resources Corp Legacy Reserves LP SM Energy Co EV Energy Partners LP Penn Virginia Corp Vanguard Natural Resources LLC Jones Energy Inc Memorial Production Partners LP Stone Energy Corp Goodrich Petroleum Corp Chesapeake Energy Corp Sandridge Energy Inc
Analysts feel that many of these companies may be going bankrupt. If your broker or financial advisor recommended these high-risk oil stocks and you had an otherwise low-risk portfolio, call Soreide Law Group for a no-cost consultation on how to possibly recover your losses at: 888-760-6552.

Low Oil Prices May Force Many Companies Into Bankruptcy. You Could Recover Your Investment Losses. 


In a recent article in Reuters, they state that analysts at Wells Fargo Securities wrote that oil prices below $40 per barrel are not sustainable for most producers and high cost structures are expected to push more oil producers into restructurings or bankruptcies in the next 12-18 months.
Call Our Securities Lawyers To File Your Claim Today If Your Loss is Due To Your Broker: 1-888-760-6552
For several producers, break-even levels are at about $60 per barrel, almost double the current crude prices. The analysts added that the oil price curve implies that crude is unlikely to rise above $60 per barrel for at least the next 10 years.
A slump in oil prices could force more companies into bankruptcies, but production is not expected to decrease significantly as field-level cash operating costs for most producers is well below $20 per barrel.  Low oil prices have exposed negligence by many stock brokers that over-concentrated positions in the oil and gas sector.  If you lost money due to your broker’s investment advice in oil please call Soreide Law Group at 1-888-760-6552 for a free consultation with a lawyer.  No fees if no recovery, Soreide Law Group advances all costs.

Analysts feel that many of these companies may be going bankrupt. If your broker or financial advisor recommended these high-risk oil stocks and you had an otherwise low-risk portfolio, call Soreide Law Group for a no-cost consultation on how to possibly recover your losses at: 888-760-6552.
