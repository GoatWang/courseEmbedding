            Maison Jardin Description - 4935
          

The special details in this home are exquisite and almost all are achieved affordable by taking advantage of drywall architectural elements.  The Family Room can be incorporated into your entertainment plans for feeding large groups or opening the interior to the rear Patio and Pool.  For family activities, there's a Game Room that opens onto the exterior Living Room overlooking the pool.  The open Kitchen with large island is easily accessible to the Family Room and Nook yet sufficiently detached from the Dining and formal Living Rooms to preserve the atmosphere of formal occasions.  Just down the hall from the Family Room and Kitchen are four bedrooms, four bathrooms and the Utility Room.  And, if your work requires after hours peace and quiet, with your own secret door to a private exercise area, well...Need I say more?  Oh, I should tell you that the home also has a Safe Room for Hurricanes, Tornado's and Home Invaders.

Avita Medical LtdAvita Medical CEO Issues Shareholder LetterTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 13 2017 02:32 BSTSource: Business Wire

VALENCIA, Calif. & PERTH, Australia & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 12, 2017--

      Today, the CEO of Avita Medical Limited (ASX:AVH) (OTCQX:AVMXY) issued
      the following letter to shareholders:
    

Dear Shareholder,


      It is with great pleasure that I write to you as the new CEO of Avita
      Medical as we move into an exciting new era of commercialization and
      clinical trials. Avita’s proprietary technology that generates our
      “spray-on skin” or RES (Regenerative Epithelial Suspension) delivers to
      the patient an innovative regenerative medicine solution applicable to a
      broad array of challenging skin conditions. These include, but are not
      limited to, acute and/or chronic skin injuries such as burns and chronic
      wounds as well as various skin defects such as depigmentation, for
      example in patients with vitiligo. Our technology platform is one that I
      contend to be unique in the marketplace with a plethora of opportunities.
    

      I have been involved with Avita as a non-executive director since early
      2013 and bring with me extensive experience and expertise across the
      value chain in cellular therapies. Additionally, I bring to the company
      notable experience in product development, regulatory affairs, business
      development, and general management — all of which I trust will be of
      material value to Avita’s future success.
    

      My motivation to undertake the CEO role for the company was in part
      inspired because 2017 and 2018 are transformational years for Avita that
      include multiple value-creating milestones including a US PMA (Premarket
      Approval Application) submission, initial BARDA procurement, potential
      for an advisory panel as part of the FDA review process, and an
      opportunity to focus on augmenting our supply chain while eagerly
      preparing for our US launch in 2018.
    

      Many of you may be asking yourselves, what is different today as
      compared to prior years for Avita Medical? Well, let me begin by stating
      some important facts that will shape and indeed transform Avita’s future
      trajectory. Firstly, the US represents the largest healthcare market in
      the world, and this accounts for our increasing US focus. Secondly, in
      2015, a five-year contract was signed with the Biomedical Advanced
      Research and Development Authority (BARDA) allocating US$61.9 million to
      Avita. Of key importance is the fact that BARDA is supporting not only
      our PMA process, but is also substantially motivated to ensure that
      Avita is market-ready by supporting ongoing exposure and training of
      clinicians and surgeons to our product via Compassionate Use and
      Continued Access. Thirdly, BARDA intends to purchase, prior to US FDA
      approval, US$7.5 million of ReCell® devices to be stockpiled with an
      option to buy up to an additional US$23.5 million in support of surge
      capacity. Moreover, BARDA has also allotted US$6.9 million in support of
      a burns trial in pediatric patients.
    

      In a nutshell, BARDA funds are being purposefully directed to broadly
      strengthen Avita’s operations, to de-risk our FDA review and approval
      process, and to build awareness of ReCell® in the burns community ahead
      of our US launch. So, to answer the question directly, this is
      remarkably different from our prior approach because the US launch of
      our technology platform will this time be
      based upon well controlled clinical trials inextricably intertwined with
      robust health-economic and cost-effectiveness data. These data will
      demonstrate to regulators and physicians alike, that ReCell® works
      precisely as we claim it does and will justify why it should be embraced
      as the new standard of care.
    

      As you are aware from our mid-May announcement, we have completed our US
      pivotal trial which demonstrated positive results in our US burns study.
    

      As I mentioned above, in the near-term, Avita intends to submit a PMA to
      the US FDA seeking approval of ReCell® for use in patients with severe
      burns. We also plan to review whether the US should become Avita’s main
      operational hub while still maintaining key strategic R&D efforts in
      Australia and other influential geographies. To this end, Avita will be
      conducting a strategic review to assess the long-term positioning of the
      company and its operations as it increasingly looks to the US markets
      for growth of product sales. Within this framework, we also intend to
      review the best location for Avita’s administration and head office and
      to concurrently evaluate future capital requirements as we grow the
      company. This strategic review may include a proposal for moving our
      administration and head office functions to the US in context of a
      re-domicile of the group.
    

      I look forward to keeping you updated as we progress in achieving our
      goals and objectives.
    

      Sincerely,
    

      Mike
    

      Dr. Michael S. PerryChief Executive OfficerAvita Medical Ltd.

ABOUT AVITA MEDICAL LIMITED


      Avita’s patented and proprietary collection and application technology
      provides innovative treatment solutions derived from the regenerative
      properties of a patient’s own skin. Our medical devices work by
      preparing a Regenerative Epithelial Suspension (RES™), an autologous
      suspension comprised of the patients’ own skin cells and wound healing
      factors that are necessary to regenerate natural healthy skin. This is
      then applied to the area to be treated.
    

      In all countries outside of Europe, our portfolio is marketed under the
      ReCell® brand to promote skin healing in a wide range of applications
      including burns, chronic wounds and aesthetics.
    

      ReCell® is TGA-registered in Australia, and CFDA-cleared in China. In
      the United States, ReCell® is an investigational device limited by
      federal law to investigational and compassionate use.
    

      In Europe, our portfolio of medical device products received CE-mark
      approval as three tailored product presentations, with three individual
      brand names. ReCell® is designed for the treatment of burns and plastic
      reconstructive procedures; ReGenerCell™ has been formulated for chronic
      wounds including leg and foot ulcers; and ReNovaCell™ is tailored for
      aesthetic applications including the restoration of pigmentation.

      activities, regulatory approval of our products, the potential for
      future growth in our business, and our ability to achieve our key
      strategic, operational and financial goal. Forward-looking statements by
      their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.
      Each forward-looking statement contained in this letter is subject to
      risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from those expressed or implied by such statement. Applicable
      risks and uncertainties include, among others, the timing of regulatory
      approvals of our products; physician acceptance, endorsement, and use of
      our products; failure to achieve the anticipated benefits from approval
      of our products; the effect of regulatory actions; product liability
      claims; risks associated with international operations and expansion;
      and other business effects, including
the effects of industry,
      economic or political conditions outside of the company’s control.
      Investors should not place considerable reliance on the forward-looking
      statements contained in this letter. Investors are encouraged to read
      our publicly available filings for a discussion of these and other risks
      and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements in this letter speak
      only as of the date of this release, and we undertake no obligation to
      update or revise any of these statements.
