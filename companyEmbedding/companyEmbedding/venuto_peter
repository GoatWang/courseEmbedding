Do not do business or even talk to Peter Venuto, who is a white-collar sociopath. He will opportunistically identify you as a chump, heap shallow charm upon you, give you a great sell, rip you off in some way, and disappear. This is the pattern he follows and from what I can tell he's remorseless.  My apologies for not being more specific than that, as I am afraid of him and wish to remain anonymous. Luckily, I don't believe he's smart enough to evade the law, which is bound catch up with him in the next year or two.      This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 12/19/2014 09:54 AM and is a permanent record located here:

                                A PeopleClaim letter-rating represents our opinion of a company’s reliability based
                                on, among other factors, their response to complaints filed by PeopleClaim users.
                                Higher ratings generally reflect a history of constructively responding to all complaints
                                filed through our system, or no history of claims filed against the company through
                                PeopleClaim. See Terms of Use

                                WeCare is PeopleClaim's business-friendly interactive profile that lets you connect
                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.

Wow, what an interview!!!! This is the second time I am listening to it and it keeps getting better and better. Tom, to answer your questions... I love the podcast idea. It's just so much more efficient, just put it on your mp3 player and listen to it while working out. This podcast in particular was amazing. I was more engulfed into this than I am when I watch good movies. As I was listening, I could actually visualize my workout, which should be taking place in a few short hours. I would LOVE to hear more podcasts.

I downloaded the interview last night and listened to it driving from work and then driving to the gym.  When I arrived at the gym I was really motivated, and was thinking "warrior".  I actually felt stronger and had a great workout!
I loved this podcast and would like to listen to more!  Thanks for this Tom and Pete!

Powerful information to take to the gym in every training session.
Just an FYI Tom, I was an obese kid. During what I thought were my best training years from 20 to 30 y/o, I don't think I was ever below 15% bf.
I got your book maybe three years ago and last month I did my first photo shoot at below 8%. What a journey! 13 weeks of zero cheat meals and good training sessions.
I am an amateur of course, I "think" I do my best for a 41 y/o male who works 40+ hours a week developing software and a 5 y/o daughter who does not take no for an answer.
Man, I still have so much more potential! And I'm planning to go and get it!
Thank you for what you teach us and share with us!

Hey Tom,
I listened to the podcast yesterday and it was awesome.  I had listened to half of it before hitting the gym and applied some of what I had already heard and had an awesome workout.  This is great stuff!  I second what I said before that I love the idea of more podcasts from you.  I hope others feel the same and that you'll do more podcasts in the future!

Thanks Tom,
A podcast is a great idea. Now we can follow while we are on the go, whether we are working out, driving, or at the park with the kids... 
One favor to ask though... Could you please make it available through iTunes so we get the automatic download?
TIA,
John

Great way to start. I enjoyed a lot this podcast. I am a regular listener of other bodybuilding podcast, the pbw, which is more focused in the sport news, the professional part of bodybuiding rather than the regular joe (is a great podcast too). So i welcome this podcast as very useful for me, i was expecting for something like this a long time ago. This first episode covered something i never remembered exploring to get better results which is he mental part. I got very curious to investigate further on this subject. Thank you for creating this podcast,  i hope it has great success in the future.

Tom,
I'm excited that you've produced a podcast, but I cannot figure out how to subscribe.  When I go to the apple store, I typed "bodybuildingsecrets" in the search engine, but there was no podcast to be found.
Could you explain how I can subscribe?
Thanks so much,
Josh

Tom Venuto  said:
Josh, we are not on itunes yet. This first "podcast" is simply an mp3 download.
I DO plan to get hooked up to itunes for subscription.
However, I don't know how to do it yet... (I will learn soon!  And I welcome advice from the tech savvy on the best way to do it).
For now, you can simply download the mp3 from the link in my post above

Please don't only do iTunes.  A simple RSS/XML feed will allow anyone to subscribe using *any* Podcast aggregator.
If it's on iTunes only, lots of people won't be able to get it.

Employees







Peter M. Venuto



















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Peter M Venuto carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Peter M Venuto currently holds license CS-059072 (Construction Supervisor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Peter M Venuto



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Peter M Venuto



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
