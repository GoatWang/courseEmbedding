Washington, DC, OSS Billing & OSS World June 9 & 10
The partnership will enable telecommunications operators, financial industry and large enterprise network users to rapidly and transparently move from X.25 to TCP/IP networks and thus be able to keep on using their existing applications.
Marben Products, an established provider of portable protocol suites for the control and management plans of New Generation Networks, announced today that it has signed a formal distribution agreement with Microtronix, a world leader in X.25 integration and migration with operations in North America, Europe and Latin America to distribute its Access 3000 and 4000 X.25-TCP/IP gateway products worldwide.
"In a context where carriers are phasing out their X.25 networks and where X.25 networks gets less and less market support, it is imperative for all x.25 users to find alternative solution", said the Marben Products Marketing and Sales Director Michel P�rin. "We do believe that Microtronix Access 3000/4000 products will enable us to offer our customers a solution to transparently move from X.25 to TCP/IP networks while preserving their current investment".
Many legacy applications like CDR Collections using FTAM or CMISE/CMIP and X.400 messaging systems in various markets such as banking, defense, local and federal administrations still use X.25 networks. "By replacing the X.25 network modems and eliminating the need to lease expensive dial-up costs, Access 3000/4000 X.25-TCP/IP gateways reduce the amount of protocol overhead support, lower operating costs and increase efficiency" said Blair Bryce, Product Manager for Microtronix.
The Access 3000 Gateway offers comprehensive solutions to a migration from X.25 networking to TCP/IP networking. The product supports both X.25 to TCP conversion and X.25 over TCP encapsulation via XOT over IP (RFC 1613). By tunneling the X.25 packet layer over TCP, the gateway allows for seamless integration without modification or re-configuration of the X.25 devices. All network addressing is preserved. By transporting the packets, the gateway preserves all of the options of the X.25 protocol.
The new Access 4000 CDR Collection Manager offers a Call Detail Records (CDRs) collection platform in addition to an all-in-one X.25-TCP/IP protocol conversion gateway. It resides between the network elements and OSS management applications providing a complete end-to-end Switch (PSTN switches like Alcatel E10, Ericsson AXE10, Siemens EWSD, &#8230;) to Billing solution for service providers and large enterprise networks.

Ten Equipment Vendors Make Control Plane Technology Top Priority in Global Interoperability Demonstration

FREMONT, Calif.- May 18, 2009 -
Ten of the world`s leading optical networking equipment vendors are making
control plane technology and Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services a top
priority by dedicating three months to interoperability testing during the OIF`s
Worldwide Interoperability Demonstration 2009 - Enabling Broadband On-Demand
Services. The participating vendors are coming together from across the globe
including Alcatel-Lucent, Ciena Corporation, Ericsson, Huawei Technologies,
Marben Products, NEC Corporation of America, Nokia-Siemens Networks, Sycamore
Networks, Tellabs and ZTE. The test phase of the event has been underway in the
following Carrier labs since March 2009: China Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Orange
Labs -France Telecom Group, KDDI R&D Labs, NTT, Telecom Italia and Verizon.

OIF participating members are testing the interoperability of EVPL services in the
control and data planes over diverse transport technologies. Carriers are
testing, in varying configurations, EVPL over the following transport types:

Next generation TDM and wavelength transport using OTN 
Legacy TDM transport using SONET/SDH 
Packet transport technologies using PBB-TE and MPLS-based transport (Testing
is based on ITU-T T-MPLS Recommendations that are being updated to align with
the Joint IETF/ITU-T work on MPLS-TP)


The OIF`s UNI 2.0 supports Ethernet (EPL and EVPL) services, so the client can
signal for EVPL service without regard to the technology layer used in the
carrier network. Participants are also demonstrating multi-domain end-to-end
service restoration utilizing E-NNI between vendor domains. The E-NNI is a key
enabler, not only for interconnecting vendor control planes and technologies,
but for value-added features such as Ethernet service delivery and end-end
restoration.

"Participating vendors are testing a diverse range of technologies supporting
carrier Ethernet services, using the OIF`s control plane IAs to demonstrate
dynamic multi-vendor interoperability," said Lyndon Ong of Ciena and the OIF`s
Technical Committee chair. "The OIF global demo tests vendors` ability to meet
carrier transport needs in advanced technology, requiring vendors to install
their products in carrier labs and support round the clock testing of the
functionality and reliability of their optical equipment under the parameters of
the OIF`s IAs."

Interoperability testing of heterogeneous network equipment includes
multi-service optical network platforms, optical transport switches, ROADMs, NG
SONET/SDH ADMs, digital and optical cross connects, carrier Ethernet
multi-service switches, and carrier packet transport products.

The OIF`s 2009 Worldwide Interoperability Demonstration - Enabling Broadband
On-Demand Services begins with intra-lab testing among each of the seven
participating Carrier sites. The test sites are linked via virtual or real E-NNI
connections, forming a global test network topology. The event enables testing
with more vendor implementations, allowing carriers to access additional network
resources beyond the boundaries of their existing networks on a global scale.

The demo will culminate in regional live showcases at iPOP (June 11, Tokyo,
Japan); OIF Carrier Day (June, USA - invitation-only); and IIR WDM and Next
Generation Networking (June 25, Nice, France, stand 24).

Aria Networks and Marben Products demonstrate control of Ethernet provider backbone transport using Path Computation Elements at MPLS & Ethernet World Congress
PARIS - (February 8, 2008) Aria Networks, a leading provider of network planning and path computation solutions for Next Generation Networks (NGNs) and Marben Products, an established provider of portable protocol suites for the control and management planes of NGNs , demonstrated that Ethernet Provider Backbone Transport (PBT) networks can be controlled using a combination of a GMPLS-based intelligent control plane and Path Computation Element (PCE) route computation servers at MPLS & Ethernet World Congress 2008 in Paris.
The demonstration used Aria's intelligent Virtual Network Topology (iVNT), the industry's most advanced network planning and path computation software suite. Marben Products' iVNT-enabled PCE platform utilises Marben Products' implementation of the IETF's PCE Protocol (PCEP) to provide rapid planning and activation of PBT networks and Ethernet services through their GMPLS-based control plane. Ensuring a Carrier Ethernet network can meet today's service demands, deliver exceptional quality of service, and exceed required service-levels requires the flexibility to compute complex and inter-dependent paths and to dynamically establish connections through the network. Aria and Marben-Products demonstrated real-time path computation of Ethernet service requests and showed the implementation of a variety of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards-based PCE capabilities, including the ability to fulfill many Ethernet service requests concurrently.
"PBT is a connection-oriented, packet-switching technology that enables wide-scale deployment of Ethernet Switched Paths (ESPs) as a deterministic transport mechanism, but establishing Ethernet services on PBT networks relies on instructions from management systems to set-up the paths. So it is a natural fit that PBT is controlled by the IETF's PCE, as PCE defines a framework for path-computation to be performed by an external system," said Daniel King, Vice President at Aria Networks.

October 15-19, 2007 - IMS Forum Plugfest III: Durham, New Hampshire USA
			Marben Products Proves Vendor Interoperability at IMS Plugfest III Event

			
 

( PDF version)



Marben Products, an affiliate of NE Technologies and a long established provider of high performance portable protocol suites for the telecom industry, proved vendor compatibility at the IMS Forum's IMS Plugfest™ III interoperability test event held October 15-19 at IMS Interoperability Lab at UNH. Marben Products tested its MARBEN Diameter stack embedded in a newly developed HSS simulator. Through the HSS Simulator, MARBEN Diameter has successfully tested full implementation of the Cx and Sh Diameter interfaces against participants CSCF's, applications servers and other testing equipment.
"Committed to the development of standard compliant telecom protocols for 20 years we are convinced that IMS Forum Plugfest events are essential for ensuring the IMS promise of openness, vendor and services richness" said Philippe Cuer General Manager of Marben Products. "The work done by IMS Forum contributes significantly to the growth of IMS. This is beneficial to the whole IMS market: equipment vendors as well as service providers."
The IMS Forum's IMS Plugfest™ III is the third in a series of events that are designed to foster interoperability and certification for IMS services and applications. IMS Plugfests allow service providers to quickly realize revenue from their IMS investments by significantly reducing the time to market for new services and applications. "Participating in Plugfest III and witnessing the development activity around Diameter has provided an exciting perspective when compared to our first Plugfest event held back in January" added Cuer. "So much more is happening in such a short period of time"
"In IMS today, the focus is squarely on the Diameter protocol performance and how it handles Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting" said Manuel Vexler Chair of the IMS Technical Working Group of the IMS Forum. "The new generation of advanced and multimedia services applications being developed require the functionality of Diameter in order to be fully compliant with standards and the demands of the IMS marketplace" he added.
Plugfest III's vendor rich environment and feature complete test plan showcased the full capabilities of MARBEN Diameter to support AAA services required by these advanced applications and services. The MARBEN HSS simulator validated not only standard authentication queries of the Cx and Sh 3GPP interfaces, but also of advanced interface services and HSS functionalities such as profile storage and modification by IMS application.
In addition to Authentication/Authorization, MARBEN Diameter provides support for Accounting features that Marben Products is eager to put into practice at the next Plugfest.
