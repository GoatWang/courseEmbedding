May 23, 2017 – Toronto, Ontario. Liberty Silver Corp. (“Liberty” or the
“Company”) (CSE: LSL) is pleased to announce that, following discussions
with Placer Mining Corp. (“Placer” or the “Vendor”), the current owner of
the Bunker Hill Mine, that have occurred over the last several days, Placer
and Liberty have elected to undertake several modifications to the Letter of
Intent that exists between the Parties.
Pursuant to these amendments, the parties have agreed, among other things,
that, in consideration of the use of the Russell Tunnel, Liberty will
indemnify the vendor and its officers, agents and employees from any
liabilities arising out of Liberty’s repair and use of the Russell Tunnel, the
connected ramp system and access to the Newgard area and other tunnels
connected to the Russell Tunnel that will be accessed by Liberty’s due
diligence programs. Liberty also agrees to provide certain evidence of
insurance coverage and workmen’s compensation insurance compliance
from its principal contractor, who is currently working at the Russell Tunnel.
Also, in consideration of Liberty’s continuing to make public news releases
and public filings regarding agreements, progress and timelines with respect
to due diligence and progress toward closing the Bunker Hill Mine purchase,
Liberty agrees to indemnify the Vendor and its officers, agents and
employees from any liabilities arising out of the filing or dissemination of
news releases, reports and other market information with respect to the
Bunker Hill proposed transaction, including any alleged negligence of the
vendor with respect to dissemination of information. In this regard, Liberty
agrees to notify Placer of any future news releases to enable Placer to
provide comments.
The closing date for the sale is extended to July 28, 2017 to enable the
parties to complete necessary agreements and plans with applicable United
States government agencies. Additionally, either party can request a further
extension of 30 days if requested. Liberty agrees to make a partial payment
of US$100,000 to be credited toward the purchase price (and an additional
US$100,000 if closing is extended for an additional 30 days) and Placer
agrees to provide, within a defined period, certain financial and corporate
information specified by the terms of the Letter of Intent. The Vendor also
agrees to provide its comments and proposed changes to the definitive
purchase agreement by June 10, 2017 with both parties acknowledging that
further changes to the definitive agreement may result from due diligence,
discovery, and results of upcoming meetings with applicable United States
governmental agencies. Finally, the vendor has retracted certain notices of
default that have been addressed by the recent amendments.
On completion of the sale, the acquisition of the Bunker Hill Mine Complex
will include all current and historic data relating to the Bunker Hill Mine
Complex (such as drill logs, reports, maps and similar information located at
the mine site or at any other location); all mining rights and claims, surface
rights, easements, existing infrastructure at Milo Gulch; all equipment and
infrastructure located anywhere underground at the Bunker Hill Mine
Complex; and the majority of machinery and buildings at the Kellogg
Tunnel portal level excluding the machine shop building and milling
equipment located within the building. Also excluded are the historic
Caledonia Mine (East Hanging Wall area), the Crystal Vug Stope, and a
group of patented mining claims located east of the Bunker Hill, all of which
will remain the property of Placer Mining Corp.
Initial discovery and development of the property began in 1885, and from
that time until the mine closed in 1981 it produced over 35.8 million tons of
ore at an average mined grade of 8.76% lead, 4.52 ounces per ton silver, and
3.67% zinc (Bunker Limited Partnership,1985). Throughout the long history
of the mine, there were over 40 different orebodies discovered and mined,
primarily consisting of Zinc-Lead-Silver mineralization. The Bunker Hill
and Sullivan Mining Company had a strong history of regular dividend
payments to shareholders from the time the Company went public in 1905
until it was acquired in a hostile takeover by Gulf Resources in 1968. When
the mine first closed in 1981, it was estimated to still contain significant
resources (Bunker Limited Partnership, 1985).
T he Mine and Smelter Complex were closed in 1981 when Gulf Resources
was not able to continue to comply with new regulatory structures brought
on by the passage of environmental statutes and as then enforced by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The Bunker Hill Lead Smelter,
Electrolytic Zinc Plant and historic milling facilities were demolished about
25 years ago, and the area became part of the “National Priority List” for cleanup
under EPA regulations, thereby pausing development of the Bunker Hill Mine.
The Company has been in contact with government officials who have expressed
strong support and cooperation for the Company efforts.
The acquisition price, as described in the Letter of Intent, is a total of
US$30,000,000. The initial US$15,000,000 of the total acquisition price
will be paid annually over the course of 5 years from the closing date, of

May 19, 2017 – Toronto, Ontario. Liberty Silver Corp. (“Liberty” or the “Company”)
announced today that, in connection to the listing of its shares on the Canadian Securities
Exchange, the management of the Company and its major shareholder have entered into a
series of governance agreements designed to align the interests of the management and
the major shareholder with those of the Company and all of its shareholders.
Option Agreements
Under the terms of three option agreements, BG Capital Group Ltd. (“BGCG”) which at
the date hereof controls, together with its affiliates, 13,308,405 Common Shares or
approximately 54.45% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares, has granted to
Bruce Reid, John Ryan and Howard Crosby options to purchase an aggregate of
4,000,000 Common Shares currently owned by BGCG. The options so granted are
exercisable at CAD$1.00 per Common Share and expire on the earlier of: May 1, 2024
and the 30th day following an event that constitutes a change of control of the Company.
Until May 1, 2023, the options so granted can only be exercised if the board of directors
or shareholders of the Company, as the case may be, approve a transaction that
constitutes a change of control of the Company. After May 1, 2023, the options can be
exercised up to May 1, 2024 without the requirement of a change of control event. Until
the options so granted are either exercised or expire, the Common Shares that are subject
to the options will be held in escrow by an escrow agent.
Voting Agreement
Under the terms of a voting agreement, BGCG has granted to an arm’s-length attorney, a
role currently being assumed by Bruce Reid, a power of attorney to vote any Common
Shares which BGCG owns over and above 10% of the issued and outstanding Common
Shares at the relevant time. The term of the voting agreement starts today, the date on
which the Common Shares of the Company commence trading on the Canadian
Securities Exchange, and expires two years thereafter, or earlier in the event that the
Common Shares cease to be listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange.
Standstill Agreement
Under the terms of a standstill agreement, BGCG has limited ability to dispose of its
Common Shares. Until May 1, 2020, BGCG cannot dispose of any Common Shares
without the consent of Bruce Reid and, thereafter, BGCG can only dispose of a maximum
of 500,000 Common Shares during any calendar year. Following the expiration of the
voting agreement, under the terms of the standstill agreement Bruce Reid, John Ryan and
Howard Crosby have the right, at all meetings of shareholders of the Company, to direct
the voting of the 4,000,000 Common Shares that are subject to the options granted to
them by BGCG as described above. In addition, BGCG cannot vote any of its other
Common Shares against any resolutions put before the shareholders of the Company by
the board of directors or recommended by the board of directors for approval by the
shareholders of the Company. The standstill agreement expires on the earlier of
completion of a change of control event or May 1, 2024. The standstill agreement has
been approved by the board of directors of the Company and ratified by a majority
shareholder resolution signed by BGCG.

Having recently announced the completion of a non-brokered private placement for over
$3 million, the Company is well positioned to advance its existing asset, and to continue

1 Oz Silver Rounds Based on Adolf A. Weinman's Famous Walking Liberty Half Dollar Design
Money Metals Exchange is pleased to offer its proprietary .999 fine Walking Liberty one-ounce silver round at low premiums. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful silver 1 oz round designs. Silver rounds are not the same as legal tender silver coins and do not purport to be numismatic items. Rather, they are a fantastic way to get more silver ounces for the money than most other options. Because of its high sales volume combined with close relationships with private mints, Money Metals Exchange is able to offer the best sale prices on silver rounds found just about anywhere. The privately minted 1 oz Walking Liberty round is a great silver rounds investment.

ABOUT THE DESIGN
Walking Liberty (obverse) – Between 1916 and 1947 the United States minted what is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful coin designs ever. Originally, the Walking Liberty half dollar silver coin design was created by Adolf A. Weinman, who was also the designer of the popular Mercury Dime. The current "American Silver Eagles" have a similar design on the obverse. These silver rounds are much larger and contain almost three times as much silver as the Walking Liberty half dollar, which only contains 0.357 ounces of silver after factoring out the copper (which is 10% of its overall weight).
Perched Eagle (reverse) – The perched eagle is a popular rendition placed on numerous United States Mint coins, beginning in 1795 and becoming more prevalent in the mid-1800's. Each silver round is branded in the Money Metals Exchange name and stamped with its guaranteed weight of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver. These privately minted rounds are not legal tender and differ in numerous ways from any government-minted coin. And they are clearly marked with the Money Metals Exchange brand to further ensure there is no confusion with any coin or numismatic item.
THE DESIGNER BEHIND THE IMAGE
Heidi Wastweet is internationally recognized as one of the foremost bas relief and coin designers. She began sculpting at the age 18 and has steadily refined her skills as a medallic sculptor of coins, medals and tokens as well as large-format bronze castings. She has served as an officer of the American Medallic Sculpture Association (AMSA) and has been featured in COINage and COIN WORLD Magazines.

Thanks, your review has been submitted.








Much improved minting if that matters...
By William D. on May 4th, 2016

I noticed that the rounds are more proof-like now than they were in the past. They have super crisp edges that makes them very easy to handle and mirror finish with more pronounced detail. I really didn't mind the lighter minting from the past, but it's nice getting the upgraded appearance for the same price as before.










Great Insurance/Investment
By Douglas A. on August 13th, 2015

Very pleased with ease of purchase process, and the competence and courtesy of staff at Money Metals Exchange. Coins shipped very quickly and were exceptionally packaged.









Great way to stock up on Silver
By Kelley B. on August 12th, 2015

Though I gave it 4 stars, because it is weakly printed and the details are not strong at all, it is still a great way to stock up on silver at a good price. It is a full troy ounce at a lower price.










Outstanding
By ron b. on August 7th, 2015

I've looked for a way to invest for the future. I can't say enough great things about this program.
Do the monthly program and don't worry about the investment you are building up. Who knows what the future will bring.







Definitely need minting improvement
By Robert L. on August 7th, 2015

Walking Liberty details were noticeably weakly imprinted including the lettering, especially "In God We Trust" with "Trust" essentially absent. Both sides were also incompletely polished. When I contacted MME about my dissatisfaction they indicated that they were working with the mint about improvements and that they would buy back these rounds regardless of their status.

Each silver round is branded in the Money Metals Exchange name and stamped with its guaranteed weight of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver. These privately minted rounds are not legal tender and differ in numerous ways from any government-minted coin. And they are clearly marked with the Money Metals Exchange brand to further ensure there is no confusion with any coin or numismatic item.
THE DESIGNER BEHIND THE IMAGE
Heidi Wastweet is internationally recognized as one of the foremost bas relief and coin designers. She began sculpting at the age 18 and has steadily refined her skills as a medallic sculptor of coins, medals and tokens as well as large-format bronze castings. She has served as an officer of the American Medallic Sculpture Association (AMSA) and has been featured in COINage and COIN WORLD Magazines.

Much improved minting if that matters...
By William D. on May 4th, 2016

I noticed that the rounds are more proof-like now than they were in the past. They have super crisp edges that makes them very easy to handle and mirror finish with more pronounced detail. I really didn't mind the lighter minting from the past, but it's nice getting the upgraded appearance for the same price as before.










Great Insurance/Investment
By Douglas A. on August 13th, 2015

Very pleased with ease of purchase process, and the competence and courtesy of staff at Money Metals Exchange. Coins shipped very quickly and were exceptionally packaged.









Great way to stock up on Silver
By Kelley B. on August 12th, 2015

Though I gave it 4 stars, because it is weakly printed and the details are not strong at all, it is still a great way to stock up on silver at a good price. It is a full troy ounce at a lower price.










Outstanding
By ron b. on August 7th, 2015

I've looked for a way to invest for the future. I can't say enough great things about this program.
Do the monthly program and don't worry about the investment you are building up. Who knows what the future will bring.







Definitely need minting improvement
By Robert L. on August 7th, 2015

Walking Liberty details were noticeably weakly imprinted including the lettering, especially "In God We Trust" with "Trust" essentially absent. Both sides were also incompletely polished. When I contacted MME about my dissatisfaction they indicated that they were working with the mint about improvements and that they would buy back these rounds regardless of their status.

Summary
Specifications
Sell To Us



1 Oz Silver Rounds Based on Adolf A. Weinman's Famous Walking Liberty Half Dollar Design
Money Metals Exchange is pleased to offer its proprietary .999 fine Walking Liberty one-ounce silver round at low premiums. It is considered to be one of the most beautiful silver 1 oz round designs. Silver rounds are not the same as legal tender silver coins and do not purport to be numismatic items. Rather, they are a fantastic way to get more silver ounces for the money than most other options. Because of its high sales volume combined with close relationships with private mints, Money Metals Exchange is able to offer the best sale prices on silver rounds found just about anywhere. The privately minted 1 oz Walking Liberty round is a great silver rounds investment.

ABOUT THE DESIGN
Walking Liberty (obverse) – Between 1916 and 1947 the United States minted what is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful coin designs ever. Originally, the Walking Liberty half dollar silver coin design was created by Adolf A. Weinman, who was also the designer of the popular Mercury Dime. The current "American Silver Eagles" have a similar design on the obverse. These silver rounds are much larger and contain almost three times as much silver as the Walking Liberty half dollar, which only contains 0.357 ounces of silver after factoring out the copper (which is 10% of its overall weight).
Perched Eagle (reverse) – The perched eagle is a popular rendition placed on numerous United States Mint coins, beginning in 1795 and becoming more prevalent in the mid-1800's. Each silver round is branded in the Money Metals Exchange name and stamped with its guaranteed weight of one troy ounce of .999 fine silver. These privately minted rounds are not legal tender and differ in numerous ways from any government-minted coin. And they are clearly marked with the Money Metals Exchange brand to further ensure there is no confusion with any coin or numismatic item.

Heidi Wastweet is internationally recognized as one of the foremost bas relief and coin designers. She began sculpting at the age 18 and has steadily refined her skills as a medallic sculptor of coins, medals and tokens as well as large-format bronze castings.
