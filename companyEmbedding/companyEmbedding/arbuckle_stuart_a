Vertex Announces Appointment of Stuart A. Arbuckle as Chief Commercial Officer

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Vertex

      Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX) today announced the

      appointment of Stuart A. Arbuckle as Executive Vice President and Chief

      Commercial Officer. Mr. Arbuckle has more than 25 years of experience in

      leading global sales and marketing efforts at biopharmaceutical

      companies. He will oversee Vertex's commercial team, which is

      responsible for the company's sales, marketing, patient support, market

      research and other activities that support the approved use of INCIVEK®

      (telaprevir) in the U.S. and the ongoing global launch of KALYDECOTM

      (ivacaftor). Mr. Arbuckle will begin his employment with Vertex

      effective today and will serve as a member of Vertex's executive team,

      reporting directly to the company's Chairman, President and Chief

      Executive Officer, Jeffrey Leiden, M.D., Ph.D.

    


      "Stuart brings to Vertex a unique blend of commercial expertise and

      scientific training that will prove invaluable to the continued launch

      of KALYDECO for cystic fibrosis and in our efforts to treat more people

      with hepatitis C," said Dr. Leiden. "Stuart has a bold vision for our

      commercial growth and expansion that will shape our future in hepatitis

      C and cystic fibrosis and position the company for continued success as

      we advance our pipeline. His experience and commitment to patients will

      complement that of our executive team, and I look forward to his

      insights at this exciting time for our company."

    


      "With INCIVEK and KALYDECO, Vertex transformed the treatment of

      hepatitis C and cystic fibrosis, and I believe the company is positioned

      to make even further advances in these and other serious diseases in the

      years ahead," said Mr. Arbuckle. "I have always viewed Vertex as a

      company grounded in science, and I am excited by their commitment to

      integrating commercial insights into their research and development

      efforts. By addressing the specific needs of the hepatitis C, cystic

      fibrosis and other patient communities early in the development process,

      I believe the company will be positioned to rapidly advance its pipeline

      while focusing on what is in the best interest of patients and those who

      care for them."

    


      Prior to joining Vertex, Mr. Arbuckle held multiple commercial

      leadership roles at Amgen, Inc., a 17,000-person biotechnology company.

      As Vice President and General Manager, Oncology Business Unit, he led

      sales, marketing, patient advocacy and access efforts for Amgen's

      portfolio of cancer medicines. He was responsible for sales and

      marketing efforts for Aranesp®, Neulasta® and

      NEUPOGEN®, which accounted for more than $5 billion in sales

      in 2011, and led the successful launches of XGEVA® and Nplate®.

      Most recently, he served as Vice President and Regional General Manager

      where he led efforts to expand Amgen's presence in Japan and emerging

      markets in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

    


      Prior to these roles, Mr. Arbuckle spent more than 15 years at

      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) plc, where he held sales and marketing roles of

      increasing responsibility for medicines aimed at treating respiratory,

      metabolic, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and other diseases. He joined

      GSK after earning a degree in pharmacology and physiology from the

      University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. Mr. Arbuckle currently serves

      as a national board member of the Cancer Support Community, an

      international non-profit dedicated to providing support, education and

      hope to people affected by cancer.

INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR KALYDECO (ivacaftor)



      KALYDECO (150mg tablets) is indicated for the treatment of cystic

      fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who have a G551D

      mutation in the CFTR gene.

    


      KALYDECO is not for use in people with CF due to other mutations in the

      CFTR gene. It is not effective in CF patients with two copies of the

      F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in the CFTR gene.

    


      High liver enzymes (transaminases, ALT and AST) have been reported in

      patients receiving KALYDECO. It is recommended that ALT and AST be

      assessed prior to initiating KALYDECO, every 3 months during the first

      year of treatment, and annually thereafter. Patients who develop

      increased transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the

      abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be interrupted in patients with ALT

      or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Following

      resolution of transaminase elevations, consider the benefits and risks

      of resuming KALYDECO dosing. Moderate transaminase elevations are common

      in subjects with CF. Overall, the incidence and clinical features of

      transaminase elevations in clinical trials was similar between subjects

      in the KALYDECO and placebo treatment groups. In the subset of patients

      with a medical history of elevated transaminases, increased ALT or AST

      have been reported more frequently in patients receiving KALYDECO

      compared to placebo.

    


      Use of KALYDECO with medicines that are strong CYP3A inducers such as

      the antibiotics rifampin and rifabutin; seizure medications

      (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin); and the herbal supplement

      St. John's Wort substantially decreases exposure of KALYDECO which may

      diminish effectiveness. Therefore, co-administration is not recommended.

    


      The dose of KALYDECO must be adjusted when concomitantly used with

      potent and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.

    


      KALYDECO can cause serious adverse reactions including abdominal pain

      and high liver enzymes in the blood. The most common side effects

      associated with KALYDECO include headache; upper respiratory tract

      infection (the common cold), including sore throat, nasal or sinus

      congestion, and runny nose; stomach (abdominal) pain; diarrhea; rash;

      and dizziness. These are not all the possible side effects of KALYDECO.

      A list of the adverse reactions can be found in the full product

      labeling for each country where KALYDECO is approved. Patients should

      tell their healthcare providers about any side effect that bothers them

      or doesn't go away.

    


      Please see full U.S. Prescribing Information for KALYDECO at www.KALYDECO.com

      and the EU Summary of Product Characteristics for KALYDECO at http://goo.gl/N3Tz4.


INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR INCIVEK


Indication



      INCIVEK (telaprevir) is a prescription medicine used with the medicines

      peginterferon alfa and ribavirin to treat chronic (lasting a long time)

      hepatitis C genotype 1 infection in adults with stable liver problems,

      who have not been treated before or who have failed previous treatment.

      It is not known if INCIVEK is safe and effective in children under 18

      years of age.

    

Important Safety Information



      INCIVEK should always be taken in combination with peginterferon alfa

      and ribavirin. Ribavirin may cause birth defects or death of an unborn

      baby. Therefore, a patient should not take INCIVEK combination treatment

      if she is pregnant or may become pregnant, or if he is a man with a

      sexual partner who is pregnant. Patients must use two forms of effective

      birth control during treatment and for the 6 months after treatment with

      these medicines. Hormonal forms of birth control, including birth

      control pills, vaginal rings, implants or injections, may not work

      during treatment with INCIVEK.

    


      INCIVEK and other medicines can affect each other and can also cause

      side effects that can be serious or life threatening. There are certain

      medicines patients cannot take with INCIVEK combination treatment.

      Patients should tell their healthcare providers about all the medicines

      they take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines,

      vitamins and herbal supplements.

    


      INCIVEK can cause serious side effects including skin reactions, rash

      and anemia that can be severe. The most common side effects of INCIVEK

      include itching, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, anal or rectal problems,

      taste changes and tiredness. There are other possible side effects of

      INCIVEK, and side effects associated with peginterferon alfa and

      ribavirin also apply to INCIVEK combination treatment. Patients should

      tell their healthcare providers about any side effect that bothers them

      or doesn't go away.

    


      Please see full Prescribing Information for INCIVEK including the

      Medication Guide, available at www.INCIVEK.com.

Cerulean Pharma Appoints Stuart A. Arbuckle to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Cerulean Pharma Appoints Stuart A. Arbuckle to Board of Directors






June 29, 2015 07:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerulean 
      Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: CERU) today announced the appointment of Stuart 
      A. Arbuckle to its Board of Directors, effective as of June 26, 2015. 
      Mr. Arbuckle currently serves as Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Commercial Officer at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated where he 
      oversees Vertex’s global commercial team.
    


      “We are pleased to welcome Stuart to the Cerulean Board,” said 
      Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President & Chief Executive Officer of 
      Cerulean. “Stuart has extensive commercial oncology expertise, having 
      held multiple leadership roles at Amgen, Inc., including as head of the 
      US Oncology Business Unit, where he led sales, marketing, patient 
      advocacy and access efforts for Amgen’s portfolio of cancer medicines. 
      Stuart’s appointment comes at an opportune time as Cerulean begins to 
      develop the commercial strategy for our lead nanoparticle-drug 
      conjugate, or NDC, CRLX101.”
    

      “In order to make breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, there is a 
      need to apply biological insights and develop unique technological 
      approaches,” commented Mr. Arbuckle. “Cerulean’s Dynamic Tumor 
      Targeting™ Platform and lead NDC, CRLX101, represent this type of novel 
      approach to treat cancer. I look forward to working with the other board 
      members and supporting management as the company seeks to develop and 
      commercialize CRLX101 and the other NDCs in the Cerulean clinical 
      pipeline.”
    

      In his current position at Vertex, Mr. Arbuckle oversees the global 
      commercial team responsible for sales, marketing, patient support, 
      market research and other activities in support of approved medicines. 
      Prior to joining Vertex, Mr. Arbuckle held multiple commercial 
      leadership roles at Amgen, Inc., including Vice President and General 
      Manager, Oncology Business Unit. He was responsible for sales and 
      marketing efforts for Aranesp®, Neulasta® and 
      NEUPOGEN®, which collectively generated more than $5 billion 
      in sales in 2011, and led the successful launches of XGEVA® 
      and Nplate®. He also served as Vice President and Regional 
      General Manager and led efforts to expand Amgen’s presence in Japan and 
      emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
    

      Prior to these roles, Mr. Arbuckle spent more than 15 years at 
      GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), where he held sales and marketing roles of 
      increasing responsibility for medicines aimed at treating respiratory, 
      metabolic, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and other diseases. Mr. 
      Arbuckle holds a Bachelor of Science with Honours in pharmacology and 
      physiology from the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.
    

About CRLX101


      CRLX101 is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) designed to concentrate 
      in tumors and slowly release its anti-cancer payload, camptothecin, 
      inside tumor cells. CRLX101 inhibits topoisomerase 1 (topo 1), which is 
      involved in cellular replication, and also inhibits hypoxia-inducible 
      factor-1α (HIF-1α), which research suggests is a master regulator of 
      cancer cell survival mechanisms. CRLX101 has shown activity in four 
      different tumor types, both as monotherapy and in combination with other 
      cancer treatments. CRLX101 is in Phase 2 clinical development and has 
      been dosed in more than 250 patients. The U.S. FDA has granted CRLX101 
      Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer and Fast 
      Track designation in combination with Avastin in metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.
    

About CRLX301


      CRLX301 is a dynamically tumor-targeted NDC designed to concentrate in 
      tumors and slowly release its anti-cancer payload, docetaxel, inside 
      tumor cells. In preclinical studies, CRLX301 delivers up to 10 times 
      more docetaxel into tumors, compared to an equivalent milligram dose of 
      commercially available docetaxel and was similar or better to docetaxel 
      in seven of seven animal models, with a statistically significant 
      survival benefit seen in five of those seven models. In addition, 
      preclinical data show that CRLX301 had lower toxicity than has been 
      reported with docetaxel in similar preclinical studies. CRLX301 is 
      currently in Phase 1 clinical development.
    

About Cerulean Pharma


      The Cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living 
      with cancer. We apply our Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform to create a 
      portfolio of NDCs designed to selectively attack tumor cells, reduce 
      toxicity by sparing the body’s normal cells, and enable therapeutic 
      combinations. Our first platform-generated candidate, CRLX101, is in 
      multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments, 
      all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy. Our second 
      platform-generated candidate, CRLX301, is in a Phase 1/2a clinical 
      trial. For more information, please visit www.ceruleanrx.com.
    

About Cerulean’s Dynamic Tumor Targeting™ Platform


      Cerulean’s Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform creates NDCs that are 
      designed to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments. We 
      believe our NDCs concentrate their anti-cancer payloads inside tumors 
      while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass 
      through the “leaky” vasculature present in tumors but are too large to 
      pass through the wall of healthy blood vessels. Once inside tumors, our 
      NDCs enter tumor cells where they slowly release anti-cancer payloads 
      from within the tumor cells.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
