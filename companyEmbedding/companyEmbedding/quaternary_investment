Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

The quaternary sector of the economy is a way to describe a knowledge-based[1] part of the economy, which typically includes services such as information technology, information-generation and -sharing, media, and research and development, as well as knowledge-based services like consultation, education, financial planning, blogging, and designing.[2]
The quaternary sector is based on knowledge and skill. It consists of intellectual industries providing information services, such as computing and ICT (information and communication technologies), consultancy (offering advice to businesses) and R&D (research, particularly in scientific fields). According to some definitions, the quaternary sector includes other pure services, such as the entertainment industry, and the term has been used[by whom?] to describe media, culture, and government.

"Quaternary sector" is a further delineation of the three-sector hypothesis of industry in the sense that the quaternary sector refers to a part of the third or tertiary sector along with the quinary economic sector. It has been argued[by whom?] that intellectual services is distinct enough to warrant a separate sector and not be considered merely as a part of the tertiary sector.[citation needed] This sector evolves in well-developed countries and requires a highly educated workforce.[3]
Between them, the tertiary and quaternary sectors form the largest part of the UK economy, employing 76% of the workforce. The number of people who earn their living in these activities is increasing. Companies invest in the quaternary sector to promote further expansion.[citation needed] It is seen[by whom?] as a way to generate higher margins or returns on investment.[4] Research will be directed[by whom?] into cutting costs, tapping into markets, producing innovative ideas, new production methods and methods of manufacture, amongst others.[when?] To many industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, the sector is the most valuable because it creates future secondary-sector branded products from which companies may profit.[citation needed]
A fifth or quinary sector is sometimes identified as the human services sector, providing services otherwise provided at home.[5] This includes the hospitality industry.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Quaternary sectorIndustry is the sector of the economy concerned with the production of goods and services. Sectors of industry Primary sector The primary sector of industry is also called extraction. It generally involves changing natural resources into primary products. Most products from this sector are considered raw materials for other industries. Secondary sector The secondary sector (manufacturing) produces finished, usable products. This sector of industry generally takes the output of the primary sector and manufactures finished goods or where they are suitable for use by other businesses, for export, or sale to domestic consumers. Tertiary sector It involves the provision of services to businesses as well as final consumers. Services may involve the transport, distribution and sale of goods from producer to a consumer, or may involve the provision of a service, such as in pest control or entertainment. Quaternary sector The quaternary sector of the industry is a way to describe a knowledge-based part of the economy which typically includes services such as information generation and sharing, information technology, consultation, education, research and development, financial planning, and other knowledge-based services. Relationship between tertiary and quaternary sector. The quaternary sector is sometimes included with the tertiary sector, as they are both service sectors.The tertiary and quaternary sectors are the largest part of the UK economy, employing 76% of the workforce Quaternary sector components Industry The quaternary sector of the economy is a way to describe a knowledge-based part of the economy It includes information generation and sharing information technology consultation education research and development financial planning media culture government Information technology (IT) is the acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination of vocal, pictorial, textual and numerical information by a microelectronics-based combination of computing and telecommunications. It requires two componetens. computers networks which connect computers The phrase research and development (also R and D or, more often, R&D), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, refers to "creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications" New product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In an industry that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products R&D investment generally reflects a government's or organization's willingness to forgo current operations or profit to improve future performance or returns, and its abilities to conduct research and development. It is of special importance in the field of marketing where companies keep an eagle eye on competitors and customers in order to keep pace with modern trends and analyze the needs, demands and desires of their customers. Unfortunately, research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. As a result, higher R&D spending does not guarantee "more creativity, higher profit or a greater market share Management Consulting:Management consultants are business consultants that specialise in providing companies and start-ups with expertise in setup and development, operations, finance, economics, market analysis, marketing, and branding. Effective management consultancy requires forward thinking tempered by pragmatism and real world business experience. IT Consulting:IT consulting is a relatively young field that focuses on providing businesses with the tools necessary to best leverage information technology. In addition to providing experience and advice, an IT consultant will often implement, deploy, and administer IT systems on behalf of the company. Marketing Consulting:Marketing Consulting assists firms to sell their products and services. Marketing Consultants have a deep knowledge and a solid experience in how to plan the optimal marketing mix. Corporate Finance:Corporate Finance Consulting support start-ups, small businesses and public traded companies to achieve the perfect financing structure with the right mixture of debt and equity. Mass media refers collectively to all media technologies, including the Internet, television, newspapers, and radio, which are used for mass communications, and to the organizations which control these technologies. it includes Newspapers Movies Radio Television Connecting the world to individuals and reproducing the self-image of society The mass media have an important role in modern democratic society as the main channel of communication. The population relies on the news media as the main source of information and the basis on which they form their opinions advirtisement Education in the largest sense is any act or experience that has a formative effect on the mind, character or physical ability of an individual. In its technical sense, education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills, and values from one generation to another. Primary education Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5–7 years of formal, structured education. secondary education secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence. Higher education Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Services are important because: They are facilitators of domestic growth –In 2003, contributed on average 68% of the global GDP They anchor and support the entire goods production process by providing value-added inputs for competitive industrial development They are increasing as a percentage of world trade and FDI –constitute approximately 36% of world trade and FDI in services is reaching over 60% of all investment flows worldwide They contribute to job creation –services activities have become primary creators of new jobs, accounting for over 90% of new jobs globally since mid-1990s They are vital to poverty alleviation and key to realizing the MDGs both: directly –in terms of enhancing the availability and affordability of education, health, energy, ITC services-; and 	Indirectly –by alleviating poverty and empowering women through entrepreneurial and employment creation opportunities in services enterprises Misconceptions about services: When a developing country or transitional economy has scarce resources, the development priority should be industry, not services   –this is based on idea that services are primarily to satisfy final demand. Developing countries do not have a comparative advantage in services exports; and having a negative balance in their trade in services is normal Developing and transition economies benefit from services trade liberalization primarily through attracting increased FDI  and exporting labour, and not through making their own domestic service sector more competitive If domestic demand for services is low, the focus on developing the services sector will fail Prerequisites for Stimulating Services Growth: Stimulate demand for quality services A strong proactive policy framework and a coherent domestic regulation Meet regional and international standards Reinforce the inter-linkages among service sub-sectors to produce dynamic effects Establish effective mechanisms of co-ordination in planning and implementation conclusion It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of economic growth. Education in the Developing World A study conducted by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. lack of good universities, and a low acceptance rate for good universities, is evident in countries with a high population density. In some countries, there are uniform, over structured, inflexible centralized programs from a central agency that regulates all aspects of education Information technology research and development Education mass media consultation Importance of Information Technology in the Business Environment Information technology has transformed the way companies do business. Manual business functions have been automated with the development of personal computers, business software and Internet-based intranets. While companies may develop internal business technology to increase the effectiveness of business functions, they may also use personal digital products to enhance operations. Developing different uses for information technology and various computer-related devices can help companies develop a competitive advantage. Facts Companies often use information technology in their business operations because of consumer expectations. Many consumers conduct copious amounts of research prior to spending money on goods or services. This research is often done on Internet websites and with information from other electronic databases or resources. Companies that do not provide a digital footprint on the Internet for consumers conducting research may discover that their products are not be included in this review process. Features Information technology allows companies to reach a larger group of consumers in the economic marketplace. Resources such social media networks, e-mail marketing, pop-up banner ads on Internet websites and other technology-based items can help companies saturate the economic marketplace. Companies may also be able to use these resources to reach a younger target market or demographic group. Younger consumers are often more attached to information technology products than older consumers. Considerations:Companies may use information technology to develop business relationships with other companies. Many retail operations use websites to sell goods or services to consumers. Companies may partner with these retailers to sell their goods over the Internet through an established retail chain's website. Companies that have traditionally been unable to sell products directly to consumers, such as manufactures or producers, may use website retailers for moving products rather than a traditional supply chain. Significance:Leveraging information technology in business operations can create a significant competitive advantage for companies. High technology may allow companies to advance new ways for producing goods or services at cheaper costs. Companies may then be able to pass these cost savings on to consumers, generating a low price point for products. Companies may also be able to develop specific business technologies that the other companies are unable to duplicate, resulting in an operational competitive advantage. Warnings:Companies using copious amounts of information technology in business operations or marketing strategies may face consumer backlash from these impersonal methods of conducting business. Consumers may decide that companies using too much information technology are more interested in saving costs than generating longstanding relationships in the economic marketplace. Companies may be able to avoid this negative perception by using more employees to create a personal approach when dealing with customer situations rather than using technology.

What is a 'Sector'
A sector is an area of the economy in which businesses share the same or a related product or service. It can also be thought of as an industry or market that shares common operating characteristics. Dividing an economy into different pieces allows for more in-depth analysis of the economy as a whole. 

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Sector'
      Almost all economies are comprised of four, high-level sectors, which are then each made up of smaller sectors. Of the large sectors within an economy, the first is called the primary sector and involves companies that participate the extraction and harvesting of natural products from the earth, such as agriculture, mining and forestry. The secondary sector consists of processing, manufacturing and construction companies. The tertiary sector is comprised of companies that provide services, such as retail sales, entertainment and financial organizations. The quaternary sector is made up of companies in the intellectual pursuits, such as educational businesses.Investors use sectors to place stocks and other investments into categories such as technology, healthcare, energy, utilities and telecommunications. Each sector has unique characteristics and a different risk profile that attracts a specific type of investor. It is, therefore, common for analysts and other investment professionals to specialize in certain sectors. For example, at a large research firm, an analyst may cover only pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, investment funds often specialize in a particular economic sector, a practice known as sector investing. The oil and gas sector is an example of a portion of an economy that attracts specialized investment funds.An Example of How Investors View SectorsAlmost all serious investors look at sector performance at least weekly. For example, many investors conducted sector analysis on Friday, July 1, 2016, for the investment week of June 27, 2016 to July 1, 2016. As of that Friday, shares of companies in the energy sector, or primary sector, outperformed other sectors by 1.2%. The sector's growth was buoyed specifically by Transocean Ltd. and Chesapeake Energy Corp., both of which had weekly gains over 6%.The next highest performing sector over the time period being analyzed was the services sector, which had a weekly gain of 0.6%. Netflix, Inc. and Best Buy, Inc. were the best-performing companies within the sector, with gains of 5.0% and 2.9%, respectively. The healthcare sector also saw gains of 0.6% for the week, followed by the consumer products sector at 0.4% and the industrial sector, which grew by 0.2% for the week. The materials, utilities, technology & communications and financial sectors all saw a decline in performance, ending the week negatively.

Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
