About this book




Hilbert's Program was founded on a concern for the phenomenon of paradox in mathematics. To Hilbert, the paradoxes, which are at once both absurd and irresistible, revealed a deep philosophical truth: namely, that there is a discrepancy between the laws accord­ ing to which the mind of homo mathematicus works, and the laws governing objective mathematical fact. Mathematical epistemology is, therefore, to be seen as a struggle between a mind that naturally works in one way and a reality that works in another. Knowledge occurs when the two cooperate. Conceived in this way, there are two basic alternatives for mathematical epistemology: a skeptical position which maintains either that mind and reality seldom or never come to agreement, or that we have no very reliable way of telling when they do; and a non-skeptical position which holds that there is significant agree­ ment between mind and reality, and that their potential discrepan­ cies can be detected, avoided, and thus kept in check. Of these two, Hilbert clearly embraced the latter, and proposed a program designed to vindicate the epistemological riches represented by our natural, if non-literal, ways of thinking. Brouwer, on the other hand, opted for a position closer (in Hilbert's opinion) to that of the skeptic. Having decided that epistemological purity could come only through sacrifice, he turned his back on his classical heritage to accept a higher calling.

     Michael David Detlefsen, age 49, passed away on Friday, June 16th, 2017. He was born in Moscow, Idaho on Thursday, November 23rd, 1967.  

In 1986, Mick graduated from Crossett High School, Crossett, Arkansas where he was a star student and track athlete. In his senior year, he won the 3200 meter race at the state meet setting an Arkansas record. With his intelligence and athletic skills, he received an appointment to the US Military Academy at West Point.  
During his time at West Point, he participated in marathon races while maintaining his military requirements and academic courses.  He graduated in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science degree. During his advanced training at Ft Benning, Georgia, Mick met the love of his life, Yonchu and was married to her for 26 years. He was stationed at Ft Riley, Kansas as a platoon leader in the 1st Infantry.  During their time at Ft Riley, they welcomed the birth of their son Alexander on Sept 14, 1992.  He also served in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Falcon. 

After honorable discharge from the Army, Mick started working for Morrison Industries in Canton, GA where he focused on manufacturing efficiency and quality assurance. Over the next 20 years, he worked for several companies in management positions.  In 2016, he joined Alum-a-Lift Inc. in Winston, GA as Production Manager where he immersed himself in the details of manufacturing custom lift equipment.    

Mick relished his time with Alexander both as a coach and spectator from little league through high school sports and enjoyed running, hiking, and weight work outs.  He also enjoyed cooking and made many great holiday meals for the family.  Over the years, he spent time in bible study deepening his devotion.  His insights and unique humor always brought laughter to any occasion.  Mick will forever be cherished and remembered as a loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend. 

Michael Detlefsen is survived by his wife Yonchu Detlefsen; son, Alexander Detlefsen; mother, Dianna Moser (step-father, Richard Moser); father, William Detlefsen (step-mother Melba Detlefsen); sisters, Erika Couey (husband Bryan) and Whitney (husband Adam) Grant; nephews, Kade, Ethan, and Garrett Couey, and Brock Grant; Uncle, Mic (wife Martha) Detlefsen; Aunt, Denise (husband Michael) Palo; cousins, Hans (wife Emily) Detlefsen, Anna (husband Eric) von Deck, Sara (husband Curtis) Creighton, and Kimberly (husband John) Woo; as well many friends. 

The family received friends for a visitation on Wednesday, June 21st, 2017 from 12 noon until 2:00 pm at Winkenhofer Pine Ridge Funeral Home followed by a funeral service to honor the life of Mick in the chapel of Winkenhofer Pine Ridge Funeral Home at 2:00 pm.
