The net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and estimated expenses, to us 
from the sale of the common stock offered hereby will be approximately $53.81 
million. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we 
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $61.92 million. We intend 
to use the net proceeds of this offering (i) for general corporate purposes, 
(ii) to repurchase, before the end of the year, subject to receipt of approval 
from our banking regulators, the Series A Preferred Stock that we issued to 
the Treasury in November 2008, and (iii) to support our ongoing and future 
anticipated growth, which may include opportunistic acquisitions of other 
financial institutions. Subject to receipt of approval from our banking 
regulators, we expect to use approximately $41.5 million of the net proceeds 
from this offering to repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock.


Our business operations are conducted in Virginia, West Virginia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and the surrounding region. Increased 
competition within this region may result in reduced loan originations and 
deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against 
current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the types of loans and
banking services that we offer. These competitors include other savings 
associations, national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We 
also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, 
including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit 
unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, 
the Bank’s competitors include other state and national banks and major 
financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace 
advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount 
extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. 
  
Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization
and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have 
larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger
clients. These institutions, particularly to the extent they are more 
diversified than us, may be able to offer the same loan products and services 
that we offer at more competitive rates and prices. If we are unable to attract
and retain banking clients, we may be unable to continue the Bank’s loan and 
deposit growth and our business, financial condition and prospects may be 
negatively affected.


Company Description
We are a financial holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of 
Nevada and serve as the holding company for First Community Bank. Through 
First Community Bank, we provide financial, trust and investment advisory 
services and insurance products to individuals and commercial


 customers 
through 71 locations in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South 
Carolina and Tennessee. The Company is also the parent of GreenPoint Insurance 
Group, Inc., a North Carolina-based full-service insurance agency offering 
commercial and personal lines. The Bank is the parent of Investment Planning 
Consultants, Inc., a registered investment advisory firm that offers wealth 
management and investment advice. Our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ 
Global Select Market under the symbol “FCBC.” 
  
We have focused our growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more 
enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through 
a very personal and local approach to banking and financial services. We and 
our operations are guided by a strategic plan which includes growth through 
acquisitions and through office expansion in new market areas including 
strategically identified metro markets in the five states noted above in 
which we conduct our business. While our mission remains that of a community 
bank, management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate our 
growth rate by diversifying the demographics of our customer base and customer 
prospects and by generally increasing our sales and service network. 
  
--------

Our principal executive offices are located at One Community Place, Bluefield, 
Virginia 24605 and our telephone number is (276) 326-9000. Our Internet 
address is www.fcbinc.com.

	Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	 


	The Company prepares its financial statements
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). This press release also
	refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures that the Company believes provide investors with important information, when used
	in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP, regarding its operational performance. The Company’s non-GAAP
	financial measures presented in this release include core earnings, the efficiency ratio, tangible book value per common share,
	average tangible common equity, and normalized net interest margin. Management believes that core earnings provide the Company
	and investors a valuable tool to evaluate the Company’s financial results. Management believes that the efficiency ratio
	provides important information about the Company’s operating expense control and efficiency of operations. Management also
	believes this ratio focuses attention on the core operating performance of the Company over time and is highly useful in comparing
	period-to-period operating performance of core business operations. The efficiency ratio used by the Company may not be comparable
	to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions. The reconciliations of these measures to GAAP measures are provided
	within this news release.

addition, there are being registered hereunder such additional
number of shares of common stock, of a currently indeterminable

Act.

selling securityholders of up to 1,305,549 shares of our common
stock issued to the selling securityholders upon conversion of
shares of our 6.00% Series A Noncumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, or the Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred
Stock was originally issued by us to the selling securityholders in
a private placement transaction consummated on May 20,
2011.

 

The
selling securityholders may offer and sell shares of common stock
from time to time, directly or through underwriters, broker-dealers
or agents, in public or private transactions, and at fixed prices,
prevailing market prices, prices related to prevailing market
prices or negotiated prices. If shares of common stock are sold
through underwriters, broker-dealers or agents, the selling
securityholders will be responsible for underwriting discounts or
commissions or agents’ commissions. The registration of
shares of common stock does not necessarily mean that any of these
securities will be sold by the selling securityholders. The timing
and amount of any sale is within the respective selling
securityholders’ sole discretion, subject to certain
restrictions. See “Plan of Distribution” on page 9 of
this prospectus.

 

We will
not receive any proceeds from any sales of shares of common stock
by the selling securityholders.

 

Our
common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the
symbol “FCBC.” On June 29, 2011, the last reported sale
price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was
$13.94 per share. You are urged to obtain current market quotations
of our common stock.

consider carefully the risks in the section entitled “Risk
Factors” beginning on page 4 of this prospectus and in the

before investing in our common stock.

ABOUT
THIS PROSPECTUS

 

This
prospectus is part of a registration statement on Form S-3 that we
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC,
using a “shelf” registration or continuous offering
process. Under this shelf registration process, the selling
securityholders may, from time to time, offer and sell, in one or
more offerings, the securities described in this
prospectus.

 

This
prospectus provides you with a general description of the
securities that may be offered by the selling securityholders. We
may, to the extent necessary, provide a prospectus supplement
containing specific information about the terms of a particular
offering by the selling securityholders. The prospectus supplement
may add, update or change information in this prospectus. If the
information in this prospectus is inconsistent with a prospectus
supplement, you should rely on the information in that prospectus
supplement. You should read both this prospectus and, if
applicable, any prospectus supplement, as well as the other
information contained or incorporated by reference in this
prospectus or in any prospectus supplement hereto. See “Where
You Can Find Additional Information” and “Documents
Incorporated By Reference” in this prospectus for more
information.

 

You
should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus
or, if applicable, in any prospectus supplement. We have not
authorized anyone to provide you with information different from
that contained in this prospectus or, if applicable, in any
prospectus supplement. This prospectus is offering to sell, and is
seeking offers to buy, the securities only in jurisdictions where
offers and sales are permitted. The information contained in this
prospectus is accurate only as of the date of this
prospectus.

 

In this
prospectus, “First Community,” “we,”
“our,” “ours,” and “us” refer
to First Community Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, unless the context otherwise
requires.  References to “First Community
Bank” refers to our Virginia state chartered principal
banking subsidiary.

 


CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This
prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference contain or
incorporate by reference statements that are considered
“forward looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act of United States securities
laws.  In addition, First Community and its management
may make other written or oral communications from time to time
that contain forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking
statements, including statements about industry trends,
management’s future expectations and other matters that do
not relate strictly to historical facts, are based on assumptions
by management, and are often identified by such forward-looking
terminology as “expect,” “look,”
“believe,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “seek,” “may,”
“should,” “would,” “intend,”
“will,” “trend,” “target,” and
“goal” or similar statements or variations of such
terms.  Forward-looking statements may include, among
other things, statements about First Community’s confidence
in its strategies and its expectations about financial performance,
market growth, market and regulatory trends and developments,
acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and
opportunities and earnings.

 

Forward-looking
statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which
change over time, are based on management’s expectations and
assumptions at the time the statements are made, and are not
guarantees of future results.  Management’s
expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of the
forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad
range of factors affecting the national and global economies, the
equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as
factors specific to First Community and its subsidiaries, including
First Community Bank.  We caution that the
forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations
and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that are subject to change based on factors which
are, in many instances, beyond our control.

 

Actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed
in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial
results due to the factors discussed elsewhere in this prospectus
or disclosed in our other SEC filings.  Forward-looking
statements should not be relied upon as representing our
expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the time this
prospectus is filed with the SEC.  First Community
undertakes no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements
contained in this prospectus to reflect events after the time it is
filed with the SEC.  The factors discussed herein are not
intended to be a complete summary of all risks and uncertainties
that may affect our businesses.  Though we strive to
monitor and mitigate risk, we cannot anticipate all potential
economic, operational and financial developments that may adversely
impact our operations and our financial results.

The
Private Placement of the Series A Preferred Stock

 

On May
20, 2011, we sold 18,921 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a
private placement for total consideration of
$18,921,000.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock were
issued pursuant to the terms of Stock Subscription Agreements,
dated May 20, 2011, entered into between First Community and each
purchaser of Series A Preferred Stock. The purchasers who
participated in the private placement are the selling
securityholders referred to in this prospectus.  The
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued in a private
placement transaction exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. In connection with the private placement, we
entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 20,
2011, with each of the selling securityholders that provides for
the filing of a registration statement providing for the resale of
the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock. For additional information about the Registration
Rights Agreement, see “Selling Securityholders
–Registration Rights” on page 8 of this
prospectus.

 

Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 69 shares of
our common stock at any time by the holder.  All 18,921
shares of Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into 1,305,549
shares of our common stock. If not converted sooner, the shares of
Series A Preferred Stock will be mandatorily convertible into
shares of our common stock on May 20, 2016.

 

The
Series A Preferred Stock carry a dividend rate of 6.00% per annum,
payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and
November 15 of each year, commencing on August 15,
2011.  Dividends are non-cumulative and are only payable
when and if declared by our board of directors. The shares have a
per share liquidation value of $1,000.   We may redeem
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock after three years, in whole
or in part, at a price per share equal to the $1,000 liquidation
value per preferred share, plus all declared and accrued and
unpaid dividends. For additional information about the Series A
Preferred Stock and our private offering, see “Where You Can
Find Additional Information” and “Documents
Incorporated By Reference” in this prospectus.

reference into this prospectus and in any prospectus supplement
before making an investment decision.

RISK
FACTORS

 

Investing
in our common stock involves risks.  You should carefully
consider the risks described in this prospectus, as well as the
risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2010 or any other documents incorporated by reference
into this prospectus and those described in any prospectus
supplement before making an investment decision.  The
risks and uncertainties described below and in any prospectus
supplement or incorporated by reference into this prospectus are
not the only ones that we face.  Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial may also impair our business
operations.  If any of these risks actually occur, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially affected.  In that case, the value of our
common stock could decline substantially.

 

Risks
Related to Our Common Stock

 

Our stock
price can be volatile . Stock
price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your
common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our
stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of
factors including, among other things:

 

•
Possible mergers with or acquisitions of or by other
institutions;

 

•
Our desired investments;

 

•
Loans and interest rates on loans;

 

•
Interest rates paid on our deposits;

 

•
The possible expansion of our branch offices;

 

•
Our ability to provide securities or trust services.

 

•
Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of
operations;

 

•
Recommendations by securities analysts;

 

•
Operating results and stock price performance of other companies
that investors deem comparable to us; and

 

•
News reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the
financial services industry.

 

General
market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and
political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or
recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends, could
also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating
results.

 

We have
issued Series A Preferred Stock, which ranks senior to our
common stock . We have
issued 18,921 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. This series
of preferred stock ranks senior to shares of our common stock.
As a result, we must make dividend payments on our Series A
Preferred Stock before any dividends can be paid on our common
stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock must be
satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock.
If we do not remain current in the payment of dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock, no dividends may be paid on our common
stock. In addition, the dividends declared on our Series A
Preferred Stock will reduce any net income available to holders of
common stock and our earnings per common share.

 

There may
be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or
other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market
price of our common stock . We are
not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred
stock, including any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common
stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities.
The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of
sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or
preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the
perception that such sales could occur.

 

 

4

  

 

 

Our
common stock is not FDIC insured . Our
common stock is not a savings or deposit account or other
obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other
governmental agency and is subject to investment risk, including
the possible loss of principal. Investment in our common stock is
inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk
Factors” section and is subject to the same market forces
that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result,
holders of our common stock may lose some or all of their
investment.

 


USE OF
PROCEEDS

 

We will
not receive any proceeds from any sale of the securities by the
selling securityholders.

 


SELLING
SECURITYHOLDERS

 

This
prospectus covers the potential resale by the selling
securityholders of up to an aggregate of 1,305,549 shares of First
Community common stock issuable from time to time upon conversion
of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the selling
securityholders in a private placement transaction that was
consummated on May 20, 2011, as described under the heading,
“Prospectus Summary –The Private Placement of the
Series A Preferred Stock” on page 2 of this prospectus. The
following table sets forth to our knowledge, certain information
about the selling securityholders as of June 30, 2011, based on
information furnished to us by the selling securityholders. Each
selling securityholder has indicated to us that neither it nor any
of its affiliates has held any position or office or had any other
material relationship with us in the past three years except as
described in the footnotes to the table.

 

Beneficial
ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and
includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities.
To our knowledge, except as indicated by footnote, and subject to
community property laws where applicable, the persons named in the
table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to
all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them. The
percentage of beneficial ownership is based on the 17,895,849
shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 15,
2011.  Shares shown as beneficially owned after the
offering assume that all shares being offered under this prospectus
are sold.  Since the date each of the selling
securityholders provided information regarding its ownership of the
shares, it may have sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of all
or a portion of its shares of common stock in transactions exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
Information concerning the selling securityholders may change from
time to time and, when necessary, any changed information will be
set forth in a prospectus supplement to this prospectus.

 

The shares
of common stock being offered under this prospectus may be offered
for sale from time to time during the period the registration
statement of which this prospectus remains effective, by or for the
accounts of the selling securityholders named below.

 

The
following table provides information regarding the beneficial
ownership of our common stock held by the selling securityholders
as of June 30, 2011 and the shares included in the
offering.
