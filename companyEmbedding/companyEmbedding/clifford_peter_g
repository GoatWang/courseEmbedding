Cantel Medical Announces Appointment Of Peter G. Clifford As Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Mar 20, 2015, 11:38 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Cantel Medical Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


LITTLE FALLS, N.J., March 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CANTEL MEDICAL CORP. (NYSE:   CMN) announced today the appointment of Peter G. Clifford as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Clifford will join Cantel Medical on March 23rd and replace Craig A. Sheldon, whose planned retirement was previously announced.  Mr. Sheldon will remain at Cantel as Executive Vice President through mid-May to assist in the transition.
For the past six years, Mr. Clifford served as Vice President of Operations Finance and Information Technology of IDEX Corporation (IEX), a leading global fluidics company serving the industrial, health and science, and fire and safety markets with over $2 billion in annual sales.  During that period he had chief financial officer responsibility at various times for all three IDEX operating divisions: Health & Science Technologies, Fluid Metering Technology and Diversified Technologies. Prior to that role, from 2006 to 2009, Mr. Clifford served as CFO of Gast Manufacturing, an IDEX company, where he was responsible for the integration of a European acquisition and the turnaround of global operations.
For approximately six years prior to joining IDEX, Mr. Clifford held various senior financial positions for General Electric (GE) ranging from Finance Manager – Appliance Controls/Motion Systems to Financial Planning & Analysis Manager - America's Consumer & Industrial. 
Mr. Clifford received his BS Degree in Accounting from Eastern Illinois University and a Masters of Business Administration from Northern Illinois University.
Mr. Andrew Krakauer, Chief Executive Officer of Cantel Medical Corp. said, "With over twenty years in the manufacturing and industrial space, Peter Clifford brings a wealth of senior executive management experience to Cantel.  In addition to his financial reporting, controllership and other finance and accounting expertise, Peter has an extensive background in leading and building global teams, M&A and related integrations, international business, and information technology. These skills are especially important to Cantel as we expand our international footprint and continue to execute on the Company's active acquisition program. Peter is the ideal candidate to succeed Craig, who has played such a major role in the Company's development during his twenty-year tenure."
