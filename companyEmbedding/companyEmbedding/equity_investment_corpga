OVERVIEW | PROCESS | PORTFOLIOS | TAX EFFICIENCY
Overview

Established in 1986, Equity Investment Corporation is an investment advisory firm located in Atlanta,  Georgia. As of March 31, 2017 the firm managed or advised $4.9 billion for clients, with $2.9 billion in assets under management and $2 billion in assets under advisement.
Believing  the key to  long-term investment success is avoiding significant losses, EIC has achieved competitive  equity returns  with a much lower incidence of loss, by emphasizing:
                    
A  strong price-value discipline,
Value-trap  avoidance,
Accounting and earnings quality due diligence, and
Well-diversified  portfolios.

In addition, we consider the tax implications of our investment decisions.
The firm manages three disciplines: All-Cap Value, Mid-Cap Value, and Large-Cap Value, as well as four SRI/ESG thematic extensions. All have similar risk/return profiles because they are driven by the same  investment philosophy and process. Due to size constraints, separately managed All-Cap Value accounts are now closed to new investors.   However, EIC manages the EIC Value Fund, which follows the All-Cap Value discipline and is open to  smaller investments.

Over our 31-year history we have outperformed  most U.S. equity indices – including those tracking large-, mid- or small- capitalization stocks, and growth or value styles.  More importantly, our risk, whether measured as standard deviation, incidence  of 12-month loss, or frequency of double-digit losses, has been much less than most  equity indices.
These results were not achieved via a random  walk, but through a disciplined, value-oriented investment approach.

Personnel

Organizations that sustain themselves and grow are authentic in their belief that it is the people that arrive each morning that make everything possible. Thus, we believe hiring and retaining high caliber personnel are priorities at successful firms. To this end, our hiring process is unusually thorough, while our employee-retention rates are unusually high. We believe this is one of our core strengths.

Socially Responsible Investing
Mission and faith oriented investors face a dilemma when aligning  social objectives with fiduciary   responsibilities. Our experience has been that investors’ social   objectives are under-served in the investment community due to desires   to maximize diversification,   minimize tracking error against indices, and reduce management costs via ETF’s.   By combining our long-established investment process with robust   SRI/ESG screens, we seek to reconcile and better balance this conflict   between fiduciary and social responsibilities.
Our investment objective is to apply the investment   principles we have used since 1986 to deliver a full market-cycle   return pattern similar to that experienced in unrestricted accounts. Investments are drawn principally from EIC’s existing holdings in All-Cap Value, Large-Cap Value, and Mid-Cap Value strategies, with additional replacement names introduced as necessary. 
Four Socially Responsible mandates are offered as follows:

And, primarily, my satisfaction and joy was dealing with your very competent employees: Lauren Hill and Susannah Ruby.From the very first phone call, Lauren presented herself as an exceptional professional with seasoned interpersonal skills. I had actually been working with another company when I received Lauren's phone call from Foundation Financial Group. I had dealt with and ignored many calls from lending institutions in the several days since I had applied on-line and was satisfied with the proposal that I had been granted. But, Lauren's manner was immediately attractive and she was determined that she could make me a better offer. The more I spoke with her, the more I realized how much more thorough and knowledgeable she was than the company than I was already working with.Lauren and Susannah spent countless hours on my refinance and often worked well into the evening. It was not unusual to receive emails and phone calls at 7:30 in the evening.I was particularly touched by the very personal way that they handled a family crisis during the refinance period. My elderly mother was in the hospital out of state and I needed to be there. There were many documents that your office needed from me in order to continue the process. I had no choice but to abandon my end of things and go to GA to care for my mom. Lauren and Susannah were genuinely compassionate and encouraging about the situations. I have no doubt that this interruption caused hardships on the time-line that they were working with, but they both handled it so gracefully and with genuine concern for my family.The most pleasant part of the work was actually forging a relationship with these two young women. Putting your finances in the hands of someone whom you've never met could be a daunting process, but Lauren continued to educate me at every turn. She was always contrasting how Foundation Financial Group does the process and emphasizing the thoroughness that each client receives as opposed to some other companies. She completely put me at ease with my questions and answered them in a way that a "lay" person could understand.Certainly one expects a strong understanding of the financial endeavors that she is engaged in, but Lauren offered so much more. She was efficient and smart but also so very human and fun. I particularly enjoy conversation and often we shared part of our personal lives. It was just so easy to relax and know that she was truly motivated to get the best plan for me that she could. My expectations of the refinance were exceeded and in a time-line far quicker than I though possible.I spoke with Susannah less but again, was so very impressed with her abilities. She had a delightful sense of humor and it was so fun to relate on a personal level that went beyond the "basics" of transferring information. I think she and Lauren have a synergy between them that would put anyone with a financial need at ease.Thank you very kindly for such a stress free experience. It was amazing to have the notary even come to my house for the signing of the multitude of papers instead of my going to her. Also, the appraisal team that you selected for the area was equally competent and personable.ALL the way around, from the first phone call to Lauren's very kind personal note of appreciation at the end of the work, Foundation Financial Group impressed me on the highest level. I will gladly refer anyone that I may to do business with you.Foundation Financial Groupdonnabarrel ratedI am writing this letter on be...I am writing this letter on behalf of my husband, Johnathon Bell and myself regarding our recent re-financing of our mortgage loan. We would like to say that we were very pleased with the quick and simple process that we encountered with your company, and in particular the manager, Daniel Sessions. We have re-financed before, and it was a long, drawn-out process, and very frustrating, so we were hesitant to do it again, particularly with an on-line company. However, after inquiring on-line about rates we were contacted by Scott, from your company, almost instantly. After Scott got all of our information he put us right in contact with his manager, Daniel, who assured us that he would try and get our loan done within 15 days, which we found impressive, but not quite believable! We did our part, getting the papers and verifications to him next day, and found him to be very professional and personable when we visited your offices. Furthermore, we were pleasantly shocked when everything went without hassle and we were ready to close in LESS that that original 15 day quote. We would definitely recommend your company to anyone we speak to about mortgage loans. Thank you for making our re-finance a pleasant experience.American Family Insurance - Shucheng Xu AgencyPeter X. ratedShucheng Xu Agency with American Family Insurance is providing very competitive insurance rates for auto, home, business, and life.

You listened to us, confirmed our needs and chose the correct product for us. I know that there were a few days during the course of our project where, because of my schedule, I was a little overtaxed with your requests. You remained very professional, understanding and helpful never the less, and you got us through the process in record time.We were offered very competitive products by our own bank and others, but no one else showed the interest in our business, and offered as much of themselves, as you did Megan. The savings on the home insurance package you offered (nearly 50 percent off!) was sensational.Thanks again for all your help. Best wishes for your continued success . You obviously love your work and with your work ethic and dedication, you are sure to continue doing well.Johnson AgenciesArvie R. ratedMy experience was "informative". I did go in expecting one type of position  and received a different type of opportunity. Something different in terms of  my own footprint opportunity vs the traditional stuck the rut, count on someone else to make me money, accompanied with a capped income kind of situation  to boost someone else's bottom line all while busting my buns to try to make their  unreasonable, biased production quotas  to increase their bottom line and eventually leave me out to scuffle for more at retirement. No thanks! Been there ,done that...What this agency is offering is a situation that is flexible with high income and growth potentials, no rat -race included. I'd rather make my own way than to let a stagnant promise of a false-hope job get in my way. When we decide to create our own wealth at our own pace,  then we have decided to determine how and when we will arrive at our expected destination.My glass, is already half-full. Foundation Financial Groupleonwong ratedThank you once again for all t...Thank you once again for all the time and energy you put forth with getting me to closing. I have to say that I have consulted with about 5 different lenders over the past year so I know what I'm talking about when I say that Foundation Financial Group is by far the most professional organization I have ever dealt with. Actually I don't think I ever dealt with a representative as professional and courteous as you in any line of business I have engaged in. I appreciated you following up with me every day and guiding my and/or keeping me up to date with current status of this process up until closing. I also appreciated the high/positive energy you displayed whenever we spoke. You truly made this extremely stressful process easy and worthwhile. If I had to judge FFG on a whole based on my experience with you and compared to all the other lenders I have dealt with I would sincerely say that FFG is #1.Foundation Financial Groupjoseandelenar ratedI just want to this time to th...I just want to this time to thank Foundation Financial Group for all your assistance with my home refinance. My wife and I greatly appreciate the time and effort that you gave our loan request. When we first started this process I was very hesitant about the whole "home refinancing" aspect. Boum, you walked us through the entire loan process with Foundation Financial Group. You went above and beyond to ensure that all our questions and concerns were answered and made us feel at ease. I am glad that you were our loan officer. It has been a pleasure! I will recommend you, and Foundation Financial Group, to anyone that I come across who is in need of financial guidance. Once again, THANKS!Foundation Financial Groupdeborahme ratedYou so wonderfully made it pos...You so wonderfully made it possible for me to refinance my home. Thanks to your knowledge, determination, and your resourcefulness this has been the most smoothly operated loan process that I have ever experienced. Patrick, I must admit at first I was extremely skeptical with all the scams out there, but I can truly say throughout the entire loan process you told me to rest assured, that you will find the answer to any obstacle we encountered and you did. Foundation Financial Group is lucky to have you on their team. You are not just knowledgeable, but you also have the personality to comfort the customer. Patrick I would recommend you any time. YOU WERE AWESOME!!Foundation Financial Groupmichaeldamir ratedJoe, you are my best friend, a...Joe, you are my best friend, and I am glad I found you and Foundation Financial Group. Most companies need to take a moment and realize just how valuable their people are especially you, the level of excellence in customer service and professionalism you provided me I really thought was extinct after talking to other mortgage companies. You are a fine example in leadership with this new promotion any individual that has the opportunity to work under you by following your example could bring Foundation Financial Group to new heights of success.State Farm InsuranceTrese m H. ratedAlex Brown and her team is simply the best!  Alex is top notch when it comes to home insurance. I had a back up in my home and within a matter of 2 hours she had someone come to my home assess the problem and made sure everything was taken care of by the end of the day.  Alex Brown has been my agent for at least 16 years now. I have my home and truck insured with Alex Brown - State Farm insurance.  I definately recommend Alex Brown and her team.  Thanks Alex for always being there when I need you.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

And, primarily, my satisfaction and joy was dealing with your very competent employees: Lauren Hill and Susannah Ruby.From the very first phone call, Lauren presented herself as an exceptional professional with seasoned interpersonal skills. I had actually been working with another company when I received Lauren's phone call from Foundation Financial Group. I had dealt with and ignored many calls from lending institutions in the several days since I had applied on-line and was satisfied with the proposal that I had been granted. But, Lauren's manner was immediately attractive and she was determined that she could make me a better offer. The more I spoke with her, the more I realized how much more thorough and knowledgeable she was than the company than I was already working with.Lauren and Susannah spent countless hours on my refinance and often worked well into the evening. It was not unusual to receive emails and phone calls at 7:30 in the evening.I was particularly touched by the very personal way that they handled a family crisis during the refinance period. My elderly mother was in the hospital out of state and I needed to be there. There were many documents that your office needed from me in order to continue the process. I had no choice but to abandon my end of things and go to GA to care for my mom. Lauren and Susannah were genuinely compassionate and encouraging about the situations. I have no doubt that this interruption caused hardships on the time-line that they were working with, but they both handled it so gracefully and with genuine concern for my family.The most pleasant part of the work was actually forging a relationship with these two young women. Putting your finances in the hands of someone whom you've never met could be a daunting process, but Lauren continued to educate me at every turn. She was always contrasting how Foundation Financial Group does the process and emphasizing the thoroughness that each client receives as opposed to some other companies. She completely put me at ease with my questions and answered them in a way that a "lay" person could understand.Certainly one expects a strong understanding of the financial endeavors that she is engaged in, but Lauren offered so much more. She was efficient and smart but also so very human and fun. I particularly enjoy conversation and often we shared part of our personal lives. It was just so easy to relax and know that she was truly motivated to get the best plan for me that she could. My expectations of the refinance were exceeded and in a time-line far quicker than I though possible.I spoke with Susannah less but again, was so very impressed with her abilities. She had a delightful sense of humor and it was so fun to relate on a personal level that went beyond the "basics" of transferring information. I think she and Lauren have a synergy between them that would put anyone with a financial need at ease.Thank you very kindly for such a stress free experience. It was amazing to have the notary even come to my house for the signing of the multitude of papers instead of my going to her. Also, the appraisal team that you selected for the area was equally competent and personable.ALL the way around, from the first phone call to Lauren's very kind personal note of appreciation at the end of the work, Foundation Financial Group impressed me on the highest level. I will gladly refer anyone that I may to do business with you.Foundation Financial Groupdonnabarrel ratedI am writing this letter on be...I am writing this letter on behalf of my husband, Johnathon Bell and myself regarding our recent re-financing of our mortgage loan. We would like to say that we were very pleased with the quick and simple process that we encountered with your company, and in particular the manager, Daniel Sessions. We have re-financed before, and it was a long, drawn-out process, and very frustrating, so we were hesitant to do it again, particularly with an on-line company. However, after inquiring on-line about rates we were contacted by Scott, from your company, almost instantly. After Scott got all of our information he put us right in contact with his manager, Daniel, who assured us that he would try and get our loan done within 15 days, which we found impressive, but not quite believable! We did our part, getting the papers and verifications to him next day, and found him to be very professional and personable when we visited your offices. Furthermore, we were pleasantly shocked when everything went without hassle and we were ready to close in LESS that that original 15 day quote. We would definitely recommend your company to anyone we speak to about mortgage loans. Thank you for making our re-finance a pleasant experience.American Family Insurance - Shucheng Xu AgencyPeter X. ratedShucheng Xu Agency with American Family Insurance is providing very competitive insurance rates for auto, home, business, and life.

You listened to us, confirmed our needs and chose the correct product for us. I know that there were a few days during the course of our project where, because of my schedule, I was a little overtaxed with your requests. You remained very professional, understanding and helpful never the less, and you got us through the process in record time.We were offered very competitive products by our own bank and others, but no one else showed the interest in our business, and offered as much of themselves, as you did Megan. The savings on the home insurance package you offered (nearly 50 percent off!) was sensational.Thanks again for all your help. Best wishes for your continued success . You obviously love your work and with your work ethic and dedication, you are sure to continue doing well.Johnson AgenciesArvie R. ratedMy experience was "informative". I did go in expecting one type of position  and received a different type of opportunity. Something different in terms of  my own footprint opportunity vs the traditional stuck the rut, count on someone else to make me money, accompanied with a capped income kind of situation  to boost someone else's bottom line all while busting my buns to try to make their  unreasonable, biased production quotas  to increase their bottom line and eventually leave me out to scuffle for more at retirement. No thanks! Been there ,done that...What this agency is offering is a situation that is flexible with high income and growth potentials, no rat -race included. I'd rather make my own way than to let a stagnant promise of a false-hope job get in my way. When we decide to create our own wealth at our own pace,  then we have decided to determine how and when we will arrive at our expected destination.My glass, is already half-full. Foundation Financial Groupleonwong ratedThank you once again for all t...Thank you once again for all the time and energy you put forth with getting me to closing. I have to say that I have consulted with about 5 different lenders over the past year so I know what I'm talking about when I say that Foundation Financial Group is by far the most professional organization I have ever dealt with. Actually I don't think I ever dealt with a representative as professional and courteous as you in any line of business I have engaged in. I appreciated you following up with me every day and guiding my and/or keeping me up to date with current status of this process up until closing. I also appreciated the high/positive energy you displayed whenever we spoke. You truly made this extremely stressful process easy and worthwhile. If I had to judge FFG on a whole based on my experience with you and compared to all the other lenders I have dealt with I would sincerely say that FFG is #1.Foundation Financial Groupjoseandelenar ratedI just want to this time to th...I just want to this time to thank Foundation Financial Group for all your assistance with my home refinance. My wife and I greatly appreciate the time and effort that you gave our loan request. When we first started this process I was very hesitant about the whole "home refinancing" aspect. Boum, you walked us through the entire loan process with Foundation Financial Group. You went above and beyond to ensure that all our questions and concerns were answered and made us feel at ease. I am glad that you were our loan officer. It has been a pleasure! I will recommend you, and Foundation Financial Group, to anyone that I come across who is in need of financial guidance.

Thanks to your knowledge, determination, and your resourcefulness this has been the most smoothly operated loan process that I have ever experienced. Patrick, I must admit at first I was extremely skeptical with all the scams out there, but I can truly say throughout the entire loan process you told me to rest assured, that you will find the answer to any obstacle we encountered and you did. Foundation Financial Group is lucky to have you on their team. You are not just knowledgeable, but you also have the personality to comfort the customer. Patrick I would recommend you any time.

Most companies need to take a moment and realize just how valuable their people are especially you, the level of excellence in customer service and professionalism you provided me I really thought was extinct after talking to other mortgage companies. You are a fine example in leadership with this new promotion any individual that has the opportunity to work under you by following your example could bring Foundation Financial Group to new heights of success.State Farm InsuranceTrese m H. ratedAlex Brown and her team is simply the best!  Alex is top notch when it comes to home insurance. I had a back up in my home and within a matter of 2 hours she had someone come to my home assess the problem and made sure everything was taken care of by the end of the day.  Alex Brown has been my agent for at least 16 years now. I have my home and truck insured with Alex Brown - State Farm insurance.  I definately recommend Alex Brown and her team.  Thanks Alex for always being there when I need you.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

Equity Investment Corporation




















 










 




 

Over our 31-year history we have outperformed  most U.S. equity indices – including those tracking large-, mid- or small- capitalization stocks, and growth or value styles.  More importantly, our risk, whether measured as standard deviation, incidence  of 12-month loss, or frequency of double-digit losses, has been much less than most  equity indices.
These results were not achieved via a random  walk, but through a disciplined, value-oriented investment approach.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
