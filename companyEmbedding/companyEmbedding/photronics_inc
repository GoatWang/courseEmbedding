SENSOR ARRAYS
Photonics SpectraApr 2006QPS Photronics Inc.Request Info 
        

            QPS Photronics Inc. has launched large sensor arrays that have up to 100 FBGs in each array, with the length of the fiber stretching to a distance of up to 20 km. Through a front-end switch matrix, 16 of the fiber arrays can be connected to form a star network that contains 1600 sensors. The networks are interrogated via time division multiplexing technology, by which the FBGs are separated by fixed distances of between 10 and 100 m. The interrogation unit sends a narrow pulse of light energy down each fiber channel, and light reflection from the first FBG arrives first at the detector, followed by reflections from the others in the array. The receiver contains a time-gated detection circuit with an edge filter to convert the light signal back to the wavelength domain.

Style Scores:



B Value | F Growth | D Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
