      Commercial Mtg P-T Ctfs
    





September 30, 2016 01:39 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks for 
      GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) 2016-GS3 Commercial Mortgage

      -- $24,038,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $10,683,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $40,063,502a class G 'NR'.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates.
    

      Since Fitch published its expected ratings on Sept. 14, 2016, the 
      notional balance of the interest-only class X-B changed from $98,821,000 
      to $53,417,000. The rating for the class changed from 'A-sf' to 'AA-sf'.
    

      These ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of 
      Sept. 13, 2016. Fitch does not rate the $40,063,502 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 34 loans secured by 152 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.07 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 70.6% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis of 92.9% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.30x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 97.2%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.9%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 11.4% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The Fitch stressed DSCR on the trust-specific debt 
      is 1.30x, higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 1.18x and 1.18x, 
      respectively. The Fitch stressed LTV ratio on the trust-specific debt is 
      97.2%, lower than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 109.3% and 106.5%, 
      respectively, for the other Fitch-rated deals.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The largest 10 loans in the transaction 
      comprise 62.1% of the pool by balance. Compared to other Fitch-rated 
      U.S. multiborrower deals, the concentration in this transaction is 
      higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 average concentrations of 49.3% and 
      55.3%, respectively. The pool's concentration results in a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 486, which is higher than the 2015 average 
      of 367 and 2016 YTD average of 428.
    

      Credit Opinion Loans: Three loans in the pool, representing 21.5% of the 
      total pool balance, received investment-grade credit opinions. The 
      largest loan in the pool, 10 Hudson Yards (8.2% of the pool), received 
      an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf' on a fusion basis. The 
      second largest loan, 540 West Madison (8.1% of the pool), received an 
      investment-grade opinion of 'A+sf' on a fusion basis. Veritas 
      Multifamily Pool 1 (5.2% of the pool) received an investment-grade 
      credit opinion of 'AAAsf' on a fusion basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 5.8% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF 
      could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans 
      and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2016-GS3 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Ernst & Young LL. 
      The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

The rating for the class changed from 'A-sf' to 'AA-sf'.These ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Sept. 13, 2016. Fitch does not rate the $40,063,502 class G.The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 34 loans secured by 152 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.07 billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 70.6% of the properties by balance and cash flow analysis of 92.9% of the pool.The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.30x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 97.2%, and a Fitch debt yield of 9.9%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a variance of 11.4% to issuer cash flows.KEY RATING DRIVERSLower Fitch Leverage: The Fitch stressed DSCR on the trust-specific debt is 1.30x, higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 1.18x and 1.18x, respectively. The Fitch stressed LTV ratio on the trust-specific debt is 97.2%, lower than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 109.3% and 106.5%, respectively, for the other Fitch-rated deals.Highly Concentrated Pool: The largest 10 loans in the transaction comprise 62.1% of the pool by balance. Compared to other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals, the concentration in this transaction is higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 average concentrations of 49.3% and 55.3%, respectively. The pool's concentration results in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 486, which is higher than the 2015 average of 367 and 2016 YTD average of 428.Credit Opinion Loans: Three loans in the pool, representing 21.5% of the total pool balance, received investment-grade credit opinions. The largest loan in the pool, 10 Hudson Yards (8.2% of the pool), received an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf' on a fusion basis. The second largest loan, 540 West Madison (8.1% of the pool), received an investment-grade opinion of 'A+sf' on a fusion basis. Veritas Multifamily Pool 1 (5.2% of the pool) received an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf' on a fusion basis.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 5.8% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period. Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2016-GS3 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 11.Read MoreDUE DILIGENCE USAGEFitch was provided with due diligence information from Ernst & Young LL. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
