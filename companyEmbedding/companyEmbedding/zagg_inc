InvisibleShield: The Industry Leader in Screen Protection



Limited Lifetime Warranty
Worry-Free Limited Lifetime Warranty

If your InvisibleShield ever gets worn or damaged, we'll replace it for as long as you own your device — no questions asked. With InvisibleShield and our trusted warranty by your device's side, screen damage doesn't stand a chance.




High-Definition Clarity
Engineered to Disappear

InvisibleShield is designed to work flawlessly with the enhanced optics of your device's screen. Its 100% clarity rating means screen protection that's so clear, you won't even know it's there




Oil Resistant
Smudge Resistant and Easy to Clean

Staying in touch means touching our screens — a lot. So we designed a long-lasting, oil-resistant design to keep your screen resilient against smudges and fingerprints. Effortless and easy to clean, InvisibleShield helps keep your screen pristine.






Military Grade
Protection That's Everyday Strong

Durable materials originally designed to protect military helicopter blades deliver unparalleled impact, scratch, and smudge protection that’s tough enough for whatever the day brings.




Precision Touch Sensitivity
Smooth and Seamless

InvisibleShield gives you the same remarkable responsiveness of an unprotected screen thanks to its meticulously designed composition, blending in with the rest of your screen and protecting every pixel without ever getting in the way.




Easy Application
Smooth and Bubble-free Application

Applying screen protection shouldn’t take an advanced degree, so we’ve made the process worry free. With our patented EZ Apply® tabs, application is smooth, seamless, and accurate – every time.

If your InvisibleShield ever gets worn or damaged, we'll replace it for as long as you own your device — no questions asked. With InvisibleShield and our trusted warranty by your device's side, screen damage doesn't stand a chance.




High-Definition Clarity
Engineered to Disappear

InvisibleShield is designed to work flawlessly with the enhanced optics of your device's screen. Its 100% clarity rating means screen protection that's so clear, you won't even know it's there




Oil Resistant
Smudge Resistant and Easy to Clean

Staying in touch means touching our screens — a lot. So we designed a long-lasting, oil-resistant design to keep your screen resilient against smudges and fingerprints. Effortless and easy to clean, InvisibleShield helps keep your screen pristine.






Military Grade
Protection That's Everyday Strong

Durable materials originally designed to protect military helicopter blades deliver unparalleled impact, scratch, and smudge protection that’s tough enough for whatever the day brings.




Precision Touch Sensitivity
Smooth and Seamless

InvisibleShield gives you the same remarkable responsiveness of an unprotected screen thanks to its meticulously designed composition, blending in with the rest of your screen and protecting every pixel without ever getting in the way.




Easy Application
Smooth and Bubble-free Application

Applying screen protection shouldn’t take an advanced degree, so we’ve made the process worry free. With our patented EZ Apply® tabs, application is smooth, seamless, and accurate – every time.

History[edit]
The company's flagship product, the InvisibleShield, was created by Phillip Chipping, who then formed Protective Solutions, Inc. in March 2005[7] and started selling the InvisibleShield product online, and in locally owned gadget retailers. The company began in a back yard shed, selling $200 worth of goods per day.[8] A few months later, in September 2005 (two weeks after Apple Inc. had released the first iPod nano)[original research?] the company sent out a press release[9] announcing their concept of offering full-body gadget protection with a patented, clear protective film as a new alternative to bulky cases. Due to the high level of response, the company began designing full-body InvisibleShields for many different types of electronic gadgets.[10][11]
In January 2006, Chipping brought in Robert G. Pedersen II, a friend and mentor who previously acted in an advisory capacity, as a partner with the title of CEO, while Chipping retained the title of president and founder. Later that year, after buying out Chipping, Pedersen became the largest shareholder. In 2010, he was also named the Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year.[12] In August 2012, Pedersen stepped down as CEO and Chairman following a margin call, and Randall Hales, previously President and COO, became interim CEO. In December 2012, Hales was named CEO by the Board of Directors. As of June 2013, the company has over 250 employees.[2][13]
The company changed names to become ShieldZone Corporation in March 2006 and then again to ZAGG Inc in July 2007. The most recent name change coincided with a reverse merger that made ZAGG a publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board exchange with ZAGG as its stock symbol.[9] On November 10, 2009; it was listed on the NASDAQ Market.[14] In 2011, the company acquired IFrogz.[3][4]
Products[edit]
The InvisibleShield is the flagship product of the company. and is now sold in many countries. In 2008, it started selling its products in well-known retailers such as Best Buy[15] and Carphone Warehouse.[16] It is currently available in all four major wireless retailers: AT&T,[17] Verizon Wireless,[18] Sprint,[19] and T-Mobile.[20]
In November 2008, the company launched a new audio product line, ZAGGaudio. It currently contains two types in-ear headphones, ZAGGsmartbuds and ZAGGaquabuds. Their former product, ZBuds, won a 2009 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase Honors award.[2][21]
In 2011, the company launched the ZAGGmate, a dual-purpose case for the Apple iPad, that also serves as a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. The product won the Macworld 2011 Best of Show and was named an Honoree at the CES Innovations 2011.[22][23] Later that year, the company announced a licensing and distribution agreement with Logitech.,[24] and also released two other iPad bluetooth keyboards for the iPad 2 and New iPad.[25]

Our Story
ZAGG’s story is as unique as its products, and it all began with a challenging problem and an imaginative solution.


ZAGG founder Phillip Chipping working on the first InvisibleShield packaging; Salt Lake City, fall 2005

With a Name Like That . . .
What’s in a name? When the name is Phillip Chipping, a combination of ingenuity, inspiration, and irony. The year was 2005, and Phillip was working in his garage. He had been given a watch as a gift, and was determined to find a way to protect it from chips, nicks, and scratches. He found the solution in an amazingly durable film originally made to protect military helicopter blades from high-speed damage. A burst of inspiration and a few tweaks later and the first InvisibleShield design was made, and ZAGG was born.





If It’s Good Enough for Helicopters . . .
Figuring that if the film was strong enough to protect multi-million dollar helicopter blades, it was strong enough to protect personal audio device screens, ZAGG InvisibleShield made its debut protecting the most popular audio device at the time: the Apple® iPod®. Word spread so quickly that ZAGG couldn’t keep up with the demand and enlisted the help of a local youth group to help cut and send InvisibleShields to thousands of people across the nation. Eventually demand grew so much that 
		ZAGG began selling InvisibleShield around the world, building strong, best-in-class distribution. In a few short years, ZAGG grew from that unassuming backyard workshop to being an industry leader.




More Than Just Screen Protection
While InvisibleShield established itself as the #1 selling screen protection, ZAGG wanted to look at ways to not only protect mobile devices, but enhance them, as well. In 2010, ZAGG pioneered Bluetooth®-enabled tablet keyboards, allowing consumers the option of using their tablet as a PC. Since then, ZAGG continues to lead the way in keyboard design by introducing groundbreaking innovations such as an intuitive channel tablet stand, island-style keys, and special function keys. These advancements were so beneficial that they have now become industry standards. In March 2015,ZAGG introduced the industry-first foldable Pocket keyboard for smart phones. 

The next natural progression for ZAGG was to broaden its focus to other categories, offering a full line of mobile accessories for its customers so that they have everything they need from screen protection to power to audio.





ZAGG’s Core Values
Established to act as a foundation for the company, there are seven core values that guide ZAGG daily:

Integrity
Ownership
Care for People
Passion
Continuous Improvement
Performance
Sense of Urgency

Each core value acts as a key component in working toward ZAGG’s main objectives of providing creative product solutions, executing targeted global distribution, and being the preferred brand for its customers. While ZAGG is 10 years old and now a global leader in mobile accessories, it’s still at its core a scrappy, entrepreneurial company with a humble attitude wanting to earn its customers' trust every day.





The Next Chapter
Technology moves fast, but life moves faster. At ZAGG, we create products that keep up with you to make your life truly mobile.
Join us as we continue to offer the best ways to enhance, energize, and elevate your mobile devices.

InvisibleShield: The Industry Leader in Screen Protection



Limited Lifetime Warranty
Worry-Free Limited Lifetime Warranty

If your InvisibleShield ever gets worn or damaged, we'll replace it for as long as you own your device — no questions asked. With InvisibleShield and our trusted warranty by your device's side, screen damage doesn't stand a chance.




High-Definition Clarity
Engineered to Disappear

InvisibleShield is designed to work flawlessly with the enhanced optics of your device's screen. Its 100% clarity rating means screen protection that's so clear, you won't even know it's there




Oil Resistant
Smudge Resistant and Easy to Clean

Staying in touch means touching our screens — a lot. So we designed a long-lasting, oil-resistant design to keep your screen resilient against smudges and fingerprints. Effortless and easy to clean, InvisibleShield helps keep your screen pristine.






Military Grade
Protection That's Everyday Strong

Durable materials originally designed to protect military helicopter blades deliver unparalleled impact, scratch, and smudge protection that’s tough enough for whatever the day brings.

ZAGG Inc (NASDAQ: ZAGG) is a publicly traded company based in South Salt Lake, Utah. It is best known for its line of protective coverings for consumer electronics and hand-held devices under the brand name InvisibleShield.[2][6]

History[edit]
The company's flagship product, the InvisibleShield, was created by Phillip Chipping, who then formed Protective Solutions, Inc. in March 2005[7] and started selling the InvisibleShield product online, and in locally owned gadget retailers. The company began in a back yard shed, selling $200 worth of goods per day.[8] A few months later, in September 2005 (two weeks after Apple Inc. had released the first iPod nano)[original research?] the company sent out a press release[9] announcing their concept of offering full-body gadget protection with a patented, clear protective film as a new alternative to bulky cases. Due to the high level of response, the company began designing full-body InvisibleShields for many different types of electronic gadgets.[10][11]
In January 2006, Chipping brought in Robert G. Pedersen II, a friend and mentor who previously acted in an advisory capacity, as a partner with the title of CEO, while Chipping retained the title of president and founder. Later that year, after buying out Chipping, Pedersen became the largest shareholder. In 2010, he was also named the Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year.[12] In August 2012, Pedersen stepped down as CEO and Chairman following a margin call, and Randall Hales, previously President and COO, became interim CEO. In December 2012, Hales was named CEO by the Board of Directors. As of June 2013, the company has over 250 employees.[2][13]
The company changed names to become ShieldZone Corporation in March 2006 and then again to ZAGG Inc in July 2007. The most recent name change coincided with a reverse merger that made ZAGG a publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board exchange with ZAGG as its stock symbol.[9] On November 10, 2009; it was listed on the NASDAQ Market.[14] In 2011, the company acquired IFrogz.[3][4]
Products[edit]
The InvisibleShield is the flagship product of the company. and is now sold in many countries. In 2008, it started selling its products in well-known retailers such as Best Buy[15] and Carphone Warehouse.[16] It is currently available in all four major wireless retailers: AT&T,[17] Verizon Wireless,[18] Sprint,[19] and T-Mobile.[20]
In November 2008, the company launched a new audio product line, ZAGGaudio. It currently contains two types in-ear headphones, ZAGGsmartbuds and ZAGGaquabuds. Their former product, ZBuds, won a 2009 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase Honors award.[2][21]
In 2011, the company launched the ZAGGmate, a dual-purpose case for the Apple iPad, that also serves as a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. The product won the Macworld 2011 Best of Show and was named an Honoree at the CES Innovations 2011.[22][23] Later that year, the company announced a licensing and distribution agreement with Logitech.,[24] and also released two other iPad bluetooth keyboards for the iPad 2 and New iPad.[25]

ZAGG Inc (NASDAQ: ZAGG) is a publicly traded company based in South Salt Lake, Utah. It is best known for its line of protective coverings for consumer electronics and hand-held devices under the brand name InvisibleShield.[2][6]

History[edit]
The company's flagship product, the InvisibleShield, was created by Phillip Chipping, who then formed Protective Solutions, Inc. in March 2005[7] and started selling the InvisibleShield product online, and in locally owned gadget retailers. The company began in a back yard shed, selling $200 worth of goods per day.[8] A few months later, in September 2005 (two weeks after Apple Inc. had released the first iPod nano)[original research?] the company sent out a press release[9] announcing their concept of offering full-body gadget protection with a patented, clear protective film as a new alternative to bulky cases. Due to the high level of response, the company began designing full-body InvisibleShields for many different types of electronic gadgets.[10][11]
In January 2006, Chipping brought in Robert G. Pedersen II, a friend and mentor who previously acted in an advisory capacity, as a partner with the title of CEO, while Chipping retained the title of president and founder. Later that year, after buying out Chipping, Pedersen became the largest shareholder. In 2010, he was also named the Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year.[12] In August 2012, Pedersen stepped down as CEO and Chairman following a margin call, and Randall Hales, previously President and COO, became interim CEO. In December 2012, Hales was named CEO by the Board of Directors. As of June 2013, the company has over 250 employees.[2][13]
The company changed names to become ShieldZone Corporation in March 2006 and then again to ZAGG Inc in July 2007. The most recent name change coincided with a reverse merger that made ZAGG a publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board exchange with ZAGG as its stock symbol.[9] On November 10, 2009; it was listed on the NASDAQ Market.[14] In 2011, the company acquired IFrogz.[3][4]
Products[edit]
The InvisibleShield is the flagship product of the company. and is now sold in many countries. In 2008, it started selling its products in well-known retailers such as Best Buy[15] and Carphone Warehouse.[16] It is currently available in all four major wireless retailers: AT&T,[17] Verizon Wireless,[18] Sprint,[19] and T-Mobile.[20]
In November 2008, the company launched a new audio product line, ZAGGaudio. It currently contains two types in-ear headphones, ZAGGsmartbuds and ZAGGaquabuds. Their former product, ZBuds, won a 2009 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase Honors award.[2][21]
In 2011, the company launched the ZAGGmate, a dual-purpose case for the Apple iPad, that also serves as a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. The product won the Macworld 2011 Best of Show and was named an Honoree at the CES Innovations 2011.[22][23] Later that year, the company announced a licensing and distribution agreement with Logitech.,[24] and also released two other iPad bluetooth keyboards for the iPad 2 and New iPad.[25]

ZAGG Inc (NASDAQ: ZAGG) is a publicly traded company based in South Salt Lake, Utah. It is best known for its line of protective coverings for consumer electronics and hand-held devices under the brand name InvisibleShield.[2][6]

History[edit]
The company's flagship product, the InvisibleShield, was created by Phillip Chipping, who then formed Protective Solutions, Inc. in March 2005[7] and started selling the InvisibleShield product online, and in locally owned gadget retailers. The company began in a back yard shed, selling $200 worth of goods per day.[8] A few months later, in September 2005 (two weeks after Apple Inc. had released the first iPod nano)[original research?] the company sent out a press release[9] announcing their concept of offering full-body gadget protection with a patented, clear protective film as a new alternative to bulky cases. Due to the high level of response, the company began designing full-body InvisibleShields for many different types of electronic gadgets.[10][11]
In January 2006, Chipping brought in Robert G. Pedersen II, a friend and mentor who previously acted in an advisory capacity, as a partner with the title of CEO, while Chipping retained the title of president and founder. Later that year, after buying out Chipping, Pedersen became the largest shareholder. In 2010, he was also named the Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year.[12] In August 2012, Pedersen stepped down as CEO and Chairman following a margin call, and Randall Hales, previously President and COO, became interim CEO. In December 2012, Hales was named CEO by the Board of Directors. As of June 2013, the company has over 250 employees.[2][13]
The company changed names to become ShieldZone Corporation in March 2006 and then again to ZAGG Inc in July 2007. The most recent name change coincided with a reverse merger that made ZAGG a publicly traded company on the OTC Bulletin Board exchange with ZAGG as its stock symbol.[9] On November 10, 2009; it was listed on the NASDAQ Market.[14] In 2011, the company acquired IFrogz.[3][4]
Products[edit]
The InvisibleShield is the flagship product of the company. and is now sold in many countries. In 2008, it started selling its products in well-known retailers such as Best Buy[15] and Carphone Warehouse.[16] It is currently available in all four major wireless retailers: AT&T,[17] Verizon Wireless,[18] Sprint,[19] and T-Mobile.[20]
In November 2008, the company launched a new audio product line, ZAGGaudio. It currently contains two types in-ear headphones, ZAGGsmartbuds and ZAGGaquabuds. Their former product, ZBuds, won a 2009 CES Innovations Design and Engineering Showcase Honors award.[2][21]
In 2011, the company launched the ZAGGmate, a dual-purpose case for the Apple iPad, that also serves as a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. The product won the Macworld 2011 Best of Show and was named an Honoree at the CES Innovations 2011.[22][23] Later that year, the company announced a licensing and distribution agreement with Logitech.,[24] and also released two other iPad bluetooth keyboards for the iPad 2 and New iPad.[25]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
