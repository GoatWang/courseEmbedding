Global Equity ETF Strategy - WestEnd Advisors
























































WestEnd AdvisorsInstitutional Asset ManagementGlobal Equity ETF Strategy
A global strategy for the long-term
We believe that investments in global equity markets, held at the right times, will outperform the broad market. Our Global Equity Strategy has capitalized on this concept since 2005, giving investors access to long-term capital appreciation through a diversified portfolio of ETFs while helping them weather periods of negative returns.
Proprietary analysis makes a difference
Our analysis and experience set WestEnd Advisors apart. We aggregate macroeconomic data into a proprietary database of more than 200 domestic and international economic metrics, and analyze the information to identify economic trends. We build our portfolio using five to ten diversified ETFs from leading U.S. providers, investing in those areas of the market that are poised to capitalize on economic tailwinds and avoiding those facing headwinds. 
We launched this long-only, low-turnover strategy in 2005.
Other Strategies

Large-Cap Core Equity Strategy

Selecting approximately 20 stocks which we believe are poised to benefit from economic trends.
 
U.S. Sector ETF Strategy

US Sector ETF Strategy - WestEnd Advisors
























































WestEnd AdvisorsInstitutional Asset ManagementU.S. Sector ETF Strategy

A long-only, sector-focused approach
We believe that investments in sectors that are well-positioned based on the economic cycle will outperform the broad market. The U.S. Sector Strategy uses a long-only, low-turnover approach that invests in approximately four to five diversified sector ETFs from leading U.S. providers.
Research-backed investments
We start with an in-depth analysis of the macroeconomic environment, looking for areas of strength and weakness in the U.S. equity market and economy. We then allocate client portfolios to sectors of the S&P 500 that are primed for growth, while avoiding those that may struggle. We select sector-focused ETFs that reflect those areas of strength.

About - WestEnd Advisors























































WestEnd AdvisorsInstitutional Asset ManagementAbout WestEnd Advisors
At WestEnd, we believe that economic trends are the winds that drive the direction of markets. But the key to investment success is recognizing the strength and direction of those gusts. Our ability to analyze economic indicators, and to know which merit attention has benefited our clients for two decades.
We first employed this top-down, macroeconomic-based investment approach in 1996 in our Large-Cap Core Equity strategy, and we now apply it across all of our investment offerings. As of June 30, 2017, WestEnd Advisors’ total firm assets under management and advisement were $3.0 billion.*
We work in partnership with our clients. We are committed to transparency, compliance and sharing what we know and learn with investors. Because we are an employee-owned firm, we have the independence to make decisions that are in the best interest of our clients.
* Total firm assets under management and advisement include $2.1 billion of assets in Unified Managed Account (UMA) programs for which WestEnd provides model portfolios but has no discretion to effect trades and no supervisory responsibility over the assets in the program. This number has been derived from the most recent information provided by each of the participating UMA programs and may not be current as of the date stated above. This information is included as supplemental information only.
 

Firm History
WestEnd Advisors was established in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2004. We have since grown to nineteen employees, including a four-person investment team. WestEnd Advisors is owned by five Partners, each of whom is active in the company today.

Our Large-Cap Core Equity strategy began prior to the founding of the firm, in 1996. Recognizing that our macroeconomic-based, top-down investment approach worked well with ETFs, we have since expanded our product offerings. We now manage the Global Equity ETF strategy, the Global Balanced ETF strategy and the U.S. Sector ETF strategy.

Global Balanced ETF Strategy - WestEnd Advisors
























































WestEnd AdvisorsInstitutional Asset ManagementGlobal Balanced ETF Strategy
A macro strategy for a more risk-conscious investor
This long-only, low-turnover strategy aims to capitalize on our conviction that specific parts of global equity and U.S. fixed-income markets, held in the right economic conditions, will consistently outperform the broad market. We put this conviction into action through a macro-focused strategy that invests in ETFs from leading U.S. providers. Our approach is designed to help the strategy benefit from economic tailwinds while minimizing exposure to sections of the markets facing economic headwinds.
Decisions driven by research
At WestEnd, we believe that the best decisions are those rooted in data and supported by our decades of experience. That’s why we begin the investment process by aggregating more than 200 domestic and international economic measures into a proprietary database. We then analyze that information looking for broad economic trends and areas of economic strength here and around the world. 
Our analysis becomes the foundation for the Global Balanced strategy. We look to make the most of opportunities in the markets by investing in about eight to fifteen equity and fixed-income ETFs. We launched this long-only, low-turnover strategy in 2005.
