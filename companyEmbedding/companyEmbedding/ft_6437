Property is across the street from 6436 Alan Blvd. Attractive wooded parcel of a few oaks, pines  &  cabbage trees. Parcel is ideal for a rural home place where privacy prevails, neighbors are real neighbors, folks are country focused and the children or grandchildren can enjoy themselves as if they were on huge acreage. This parcel is practical for a small AG oriented owner who dabbles in horses, small animal husbandry or even a gentleman’s estate. Many do not realize this but you can operate your business from here if you abide by the County rules. Fronts on Alan Blvd. Nice homes nearby in the overall neighborhood. One home per parcel here. Land is zoned AG (Agriculture) which retains the open character of the land. Uses are conservation, agriculture, low-density residential, recreation and other uses. AG is associated with noise/odors/dust  &  other uses generally incompatible with urban life. District provides for AG operations at very low densities for buyers who want to live in an AG environment. Raising of cattle/sheep/swine  &  poultry/dairy/processing of dairy products/breeding  &  training/boarding of animals associated with or kept in support of AG operations.

Shire’s velaglucerase alfa expected to get FDA approval for Gaucher’s disease

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shire’s velaglucerase alfa for type I Gaucher’s disease is expected to receive FDA approval by 28 February, according to investigators interviewed by Pharmawire.
Genzyme’s Cerezyme is currently the only FDA approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the disease, an inherited condition in which a fatty substance builds in organs and tissues such as the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The more common type I form does not affect the central nervous system. 
Velaglucerase alfa is a gene-activated ERT, targeting a slice in a market that is currently worth more than USD 1bn but dominated by Genzyme. Cerezyme has been available since 1994.
Velaglucerase alfa is the only ERT to be produced in a human cell line -- resulting in the drug being identical to the naturally occurring enzyme glucocerebrosidase that’s deficient in Gaucher’s patients. 
In contrast, Cerezyme is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Protalix’s Uplyso (taliglucerase alfa), another ERT currently in preregistration with the FDA, uses carrot cell plant-based production. Both these products have a mutation that distinguishes them from the natural enzyme. 
The difference between the products offers at least a theoretical edge to Velaglucerase alfa, experts have noted, and Shire’s product is also believed to have increased cellular uptake.
Dr Ari Zimran, director of the Gaucher Clinic at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem and an investigator for several Gaucher’s trials, said that velaglucerase alfa seemed theoretically superior based on early research. However, he added that the drug is likely to be similar to Cerezyme in clinical practice.
Dr Atul Mehta, clinical director of the lysosomal storage disorders unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London, agreed that despite the native enzyme sequence, velaglucerase is not anticipated to have clinical superiority especially since Cerezyme is an excellent drug.
Several other experts interviewed by this news service indicated that velaglucerase alfa therapy will likely be similar to Cerezyme in safety and efficacy.
All signs point to approval

Dr Paul Fernhoff, a clinical geneticist at Emory University School of Medicine, said the data shows no major safety issues with velaglucerase alfa and he does not see any reason why it would not be approved unless something last minute comes up. Velaglucerase alfa will likely be approved with a strict post-marketing follow-up, Fernhoff added.
One investigator close to Shire’s clinical trials had noted that the FDA was carrying out an ”extensive” pre-approval inspection of clinical trial facilities, as previously reported by this news service. The source noted that no issues had come up and did not expect any last minute problems to arise, adding that velaglucerase alfa will most likely be approved without delays by its Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date.
Dr David Kuter, professor at Harvard Medical School and director of clinical hematology at Massachusetts General Hospital, speculated that velaglucerase alfa will be approved with a typical post-marketing study. He added that there has been discontent with Genzyme among some physicians due to the high cost of the product and manufacturing issues last year that temporarily stalled production. Kuter noted that new therapies appear to be equally efficacious compared to Cerezyme and therefore many of his patients are looking forward to switching therapies.
On the other hand, Dr Roscoe Brady, scientist emeritus at the National Institutes of Health and a medical board member of National Gaucher Foundation, noted that patients have been happy with Cerezyme and many of them may not want to change therapies despite the manufacturing issues. However, some of these patients are already receiving Shire’s enzyme under the FDA expanded access program, which was put in place to address the Cerezyme shortage; Shire also provided the therapy for free, Brady added.
Theresa Heggie, head of global strategic marketing and lysosomal storage disorders development at Shire, noted that the company has worked to accelerate clinical and manufacturing timelines over the past six months. She added that if the FDA were to make a decision prior to the PDUFA date of 28 February, the company ”would be ready.” She also said that sales force ”training and readiness efforts are complete.” Heggie confirmed that the FDA recently completed the pre-approval inspections of Shire facilities in Cambridge and Lexington, Massachusetts for the manufacturing and testing of velaglucerase alfa. FDA has been ”quite responsive” in terms of inspections, she added. 
Pricing will be key to adoption

The main issue in terms of adoption of velaglucerase will ultimately be pricing, since everything else is essentially the same as Cerezyme, Gaucher’s experts noted. One year therapy for Gaucher’s can cost up to USD 300,000/year.
With demonstration of non-inferiority to Cerezyme being the most likely scenario, price will be the predominant factor for market adoption, said Dr Gregory Pastors of New York University Medical Center, who has been involved with other Gaucher’s trials. He added that some patients who received velaglucerase alfa free of charge due to expanded access will have a ”taste for the drug” and may prefer to continue with it. 
Dr Ozlem Goker-Alpan, a former researcher at the National Human Genome Research Institute, said she expects velaglucerase will be approved and hopes that the introduction of new drugs will create healthy competition and bring down the cost for Gaucher’s disease therapeutics. Many Gaucher’s patients have reached their lifetime insurance maximum and are unable to afford drugs, Alpan said. 
Dr Roberto Giugliani, a professor in the department of genetics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, noted that he looks forward to the approval of velaglucerase alfa. Newer treatments will be just as safe and efficacious - but cheaper - making Gaucher’s therapy more affordable especially in developing nations such as Brazil.
