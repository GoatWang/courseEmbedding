			Noel J. Fenton, 73, co-founded Trinity Ventures in 1986, a venture capital firm of which he is a general partner, and has served as our director since 1998. He also serves as a director of SciQuest, Inc., a provider of eprocurement solutions, and of several private companies. Mr. Fenton holds a B.S. from Cornell University and an M.B.A. from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. Prior to co-founding Trinity Ventures, he was a co-founder of three successful technology start-ups and CEO of two of them. Mr. Fenton is actively involved in the World's Presidents' Organization and is a past Chairman of the Northern California Chapter of the Young Presidents' Organization and a past chairman of the American Electronic Association. Trinity Ventures made an initial investment in the Company's predecessor in 1998, and Mr. Fenton joined the Board at that time. 

We believe Mr. Fenton's qualifications to sit on our Board include his previous operating experience as a CEO, his service on the board of directors of close to 30 companies in which his venture capital firm had invested and, as one of our early stage investors, his extensive knowledge of our Company and the online marketplace and real estate industries. Mr. Fenton has over 14 years of service as a director of our Company and also serves as our Lead Independent Director.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
