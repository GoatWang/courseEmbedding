	Nabors - Our History





































 Our History  Share | Print     

               1963 In 1963, we set the bar for drilling in Alaska, drilling the discovery well for ARCO in what would become the giant Prudhoe Bay Field on Alaska’s North Slope. We went on to drill BP’s first successful well in that field.
                 1960s We pioneered the use of camps to support drilling activity, engineered new methods for making crew changes and led the pack as the first company to staff women in our camps. Our innovations in Alaska – where we pioneered the development and use of modular rigs and moving systems, and would later drill the world’s first horizontal well – continue to be used today.
                 1974 In 1974, our advances attracted the attention of the Guggenheim family, owners of New York-based company Anglo Energy. Anglo acquired control of Nabors Drilling. After a decade of ownership, a decline in the economy, and a depressed oil and gas energy market forced Anglo into bankruptcy, but gave investors Gene Isenberg and Marty Whitman the opportunity they needed to take the company in a new direction of growth and prosperity.
                 1986 Isenberg and Whitman acquired a sizable position in the company in 1986 by convincing creditors to trade debt for equity, strengthening the company’s financial position. They took control of the company and changed the name from Anglo to Nabors, a brand that enjoyed a great reputation in Alaska and Canada.                    1988 In 1988, Chairman and CEO Isenberg identified Westburne Drilling as our company’s first international acquisition with operations in the Middle East. This success began an era of growth and acquisitions for Nabors that would continue for more than two decades.
                 1990 In 1990, our company acquired the venerable Loffland Brothers Drilling, a company with 75 years of history and at one time the largest drilling company in the world. Nabors opened a corporate headquarters in Houston to manage the company’s expected growth as we bought up drilling contractors at a significant discount.
                 1993 Grace Drilling was one such drilling contractor, and its 1993 acquisition by Nabors was a deal so good it is unlikely to be repeated. Nabors added 167 rigs to our fleet for only $32 million – approximately 15 cents on the replacement dollar.
                 1997 
Nabors continued to grow, expanding into new branches of the industry. The acquisition of a hydraulic slant drilling rig from Canada-based Canrig, which had just completed construction of a portable top drive prototype, put Nabors into the drilling equipment business. Acquiring Sundowner expanded our presence in offshore drilling. The purchase of Epoch Well Services in 1997 put Nabors into the instrumentation market and was the first step in expanding our wellsite content offering, including technology such as ROCKIT®; and REVIT™.
                 1997–1998 Nabors made seven more acquisitions in 1997 and six in 1998 as we saw opportunities to provide more services to more customers. The addition of Pool Energy Services in 1999 brought Nabors into the well servicing business and extended the company’s reach internationally, particularly in Saudi Arabia and Mexico.
                 2010 In 2010, Nabors completed its largest acquisition to date when it added Superior Well Services. This acquisition added pressure pumping, which is an essential piece for developing oil and gas shales, and provided the missing link in our company’s life-of-well strategy. Additionally, Superior brought premium assets with strong market positions and great growth potential.                  Onward Our growth during these years has been nothing short of remarkable. The stock price went from less than 50 cents to more than $50 before splitting. Enterprise value went from $100 million to $17 billion and the employee workforce mushroomed from 320 to more than 29,000.

  Nabors is an industry pacesetter. Since its founding in 1952 by Clair Nabors, our company has been driven by growth and innovation.   In 1963, we set the bar for drilling in Alaska, drilling the discovery well for ARCO in what would become the giant Prudhoe Bay Field on Alaska’s North Slope. We went on to drill BP’s first successful well in that field.   We pioneered the use of camps to support drilling activity, engineered new methods for making crew changes and led the pack as the first company to staff women in our camps. Our innovations in Alaska – where we pioneered the development and use of modular rigs and moving systems, and would later drill the world’s first horizontal well – continue to be used today.   In 1974, our advances attracted the attention of the Guggenheim family, owners of New York-based company Anglo Energy. Anglo acquired control of Nabors Drilling. After a decade of ownership, a decline in the economy and a depressed oil and gas energy market forced Anglo into bankruptcy, but gave investors Gene Isenberg and Marty Whitman the opportunity they needed to take the company in a new direction of growth and prosperity.   Isenberg and Whitman acquired a sizable position in the company in 1986 by convincing creditors to trade debt for equity, strengthening the company’s financial position.

In 2015, Nabors renewed its focus on drilling services and technologies by combining its completion and production services business with C&J Energy Services. This transaction enabled Nabors to devote its talent and resources on improving and growing the Company's position within the global drilling market while also creating a high-quality, diversified oilfield services company in North America with strong international growth potential. By maintaining a significant ownership interest in the new company, Nabors will capture the earnings potential of the business as market conditions improve.  Today, Nabors Industries is one of the world's largest oil and gas drilling contractors. It boasts a tremendous portfolio of high quality, innovative assets, an ethnically diverse, culturally rich and multi-talented workforce, and a global infrastructure of services and facilities that is unmatched in the industry.

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

History[edit]
Anglo Energy[edit]
Anglo Energy, Ltd. was founded in 1968, and publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange with Class A shares under the ticker symbol AEL.A[2][3]
Through the long secular bear market and economic malaise of the 1970s, the company performed well, leading up to the early 1980s recession, when troubles began to surface. In 1981, earnings came in at US$36 million, excluding an extraordinary charge of US$2 million.[2]
However, coming out of the recession by 1982, the company suffered a loss of US$4 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$4.6 million.[2]
By 1983, the company was in serious trouble. The loss that year had grown to US$53 million, excluding an extradordinary charge of an additional US$50 million.[2] That year Anglo Energy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. At that time the company had assets of US$694 million, with sales revenue of US$310 million, and 860 employees.[4] The stock was halted for trading by the AMEX on November 7, 1983, although it continued to trade on the NASDAQ OTC exchange, as it was then known. From its 1970s high, the stock price had fallen by 97% by the end of the year, to a new all-time low.[2]
In 1984, with the company in bankruptcy, the loss was less severe than it had been the prior year, at only US$25 million, excluding extraordinary income of US$6 million. However, the stock price set a new all-time low again that year, and began trading as a penny stock (under $1), down another 23% from its 1983 low.[2]
In 1985, the loss deepened yet again, to nearly US$29 million. By then the company carried long-term debt of US$154 million. The stock once again fell to its 1984 low, but then recovered up almost threefold from that low during the year. However, by the end of the year, it had dropped yet again by half from that mid-year high, though it still traded 40% above its all-time low set in the prior two years.[2]
In 1986, Anglo Energy emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and refiled.[4] Despite the reorganization relief that year, which decreased the company's long-term debt to only US$32 million, the company's loss deepened yet again in 1986, to its largest since 1983, at US$30 million. The penny stock price fell that year by another 50% from its previous 1984-1985 all-time low, to set what would become its final all-time low in 1986. Also that year, the company issued warrants traded on the AMEX, through 1989.[2]
In 1987, Anglo Energy exited its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, and changed its name to Anglo Energy Inc. It continued to trade on the AMEX under the ticker symbol AEL. By mid-year the stock price rose tenfold from its prior year all-time low, but then fell victim to the 1987 stock market crash. By the end of the year, the stock price dropped from its earlier high that year, by almost 90% again, nearly to the level of its 1986 all-time penny stock low, as the company's 1987 loss amounted to a record US$94 million.[2][3]
Nabors Industries[edit]
Anglo Energy subsequently changed its name to Nabors Industries Ltd., which also traded on the AMEX, under the new symbol NBR, until its move to the New York Stock Exchange by the early 2000s.[2][3]
Eugene M. Isenberg became Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Nabors in the 1987 reorganization. From 1969 to 1982, he had been Chairman and the principal shareholder of Genimar, Inc., a steel trading and building products manufacturing company, until its sale in 1982.[3]
By the early 1990s, Nabors Industries survived its post-bankruptcy financing troubles by diluting shareholder value, with the issuance of an eightfold increase in the number of common shares outstanding. But consequently the company kept its debt under control, at under US$60 million through the mid-1990s.[2]
The company performed well through the 1990-1991 recession, with earnings of US$23 million and US$37 million, respectively.[2] On October 1, 1991, Anthony G. Petrello was hired and became Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer of Nabors Industries. Since 1986 he had previously been Managing Partner of the New York Office of the law firm Baker & McKenzie, until his resignation from that firm in 1991.[3]
In 1992, the earnings growth trend continued for Nabors, at US$44 million. By the end of 1992 the penny stock had risen tenfold again from its 1987 low, and the revived company had been added to the S&P MidCap 400 Index. But by 1993, the earnings trend began to turn down again, at only US$42 million.[2]
In 1994, the economy slowed through the soft landing, and Nabors Industries earnings also declined, to only a marginal profit of less than a million dollars. The stock price floundered as well that year, down 30% from its earlier 1993 high.[2]
In 1995, earnings fully recovered, to almost US$49 million. The company continued to issue shares at a steady pace, but the stock price doubled that year. By early 1996, the stock price rose another 50%, although at that time it was still trading at less than half the 1970s all-time high price of its predecessor. However, the positive trends in the company and in the overall stock market continued through the second half of the decade.[2]
During the late 1990s, Nabors Industries continued to grow, and was added to the S&P 500 Index of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The stock moved from the AMEX to the NYSE.
On July 20, 2007, Nabors Industries sold its Sea Mar Fleet for US$189 million in cash to Hornbeck Offshore Services, including 20 offshore supply vessels (OSVs). The deal closed in early August 2007.[1]
Ethics Committee investigation[edit]
The House Ethics Committee voted on December 9, 2008, to expand its investigation into Representative Charles B. Rangel to examine his role in preserving a tax loophole for an oil drilling company whose chief executive Eugene Isenberg pledged $1 million to a City College of New York project that will bear the congressman's name.[5]
At the annual shareholders meeting in Houston, Texas on June 2, 2009, Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group and a shareholder, questioned Isenberg about his $1 million pledge to The Rangel Center. Isenberg denied any quid pro quo. Isenberg was clearly annoyed at Flaherty's line of inquiry. Isenberg admitted he has paid $400,000 of the pledge and insisted he would pay the rest. Isenberg called the New York Times article "full of malarkey", and challenged the Times' account of a meeting that he had with Rangel on the same day that the Ways and Means Committee was marking up legislation affecting the loophole.[6] Susan Crabtree, The Hill, writes that Flaherty caught the whole exchange between himself and Isenberg on tape.[7]
"Golden coffin" controversy[edit]
Also at the Nabors Annual Shareholders June 2, 2009, meeting, a stockholder proposal calling for investor approval of executive death benefits at Nabors Industries was voted down. Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds owns 80,194 shares in Nabors sponsored the proposal. Amalgamated proposed that Nabors get shareholder approval for agreements that award unearned salary, bonuses and other compensation to executives' estates if they die. These arrangements are called "Golden coffins." Nabors had urged its shareholders to vote against the proposal. In April, Nabors renegotiated new death benefit packages for CEO Eugene Isenberg and COO Anthony Petrello, lowering the total collective payments by more than $200 million.[8]
Jet Abuse Investigation[edit]
A June 19, 2011, Wall Street Journal story reviewing FAA records reported that Nabors had failed to provide a dollar figure for the cost of aircraft use by CEO Eugene Isenberg during 2009 and 2010. According to the article Nabors jet fleet often flew to resort destinations including Palm Beach and Martha's Vineyard, per WSJ estimates those flights alone would have cost over $704,000. An amount that far exceeds the SEC rules which require disclosure of the cost of any personal travel that exceeds $25,000."Corporate Jet Set: Leisure vs. Business"'
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Houston office is located in Greenspoint.[9]
In March 2015, Nabors said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in response to falling upstream activity amid slumping oil prices. The company will cut 10 percent of its sales staff and 20 percent of its U.S. drilling workforce.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
