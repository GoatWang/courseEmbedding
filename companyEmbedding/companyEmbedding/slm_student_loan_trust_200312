For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 Notes | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 Notes
    





May 19, 2015 11:43 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 senior 
      notes at 'AAAsf' and subordinate note at 'BBBsf'. The Rating Outlook 
      remains Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of 100% of 
      Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. The credit quality 
      of the trust collateral is high, in Fitch's opinion, based on the 
      guarantees provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and 
      reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at 
      least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The current U.S. sovereign 
      rating is 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): CE is provided by excess spread and, 
      for the class A notes, subordination provided by the class B notes. As 
      of February 2015, excluding the reserve account, total parity is 100.00% 
      and senior parity is 104.80% (4.58% CE). Including the reserve, total 
      effective parity is 100.38% and senior effective parity is 105.20%. The 
      subordinate notes are receiving principal pro rata as the stepdown date 
      (Dec. 15, 2008) has passed. Cash is being released from the trust given 
      that the target total parity of 100% is maintained.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve 
      account which is sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and 
      $3,759,518, currently equal to the floor.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by 
      Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). In Fitch's 
      opinion, this servicer is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in 
      FFELP student loan transactions. Additional defaults and basis shock 
      beyond Fitch's published stresses could result in future downgrades. 
      Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess spread, given that 
      favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust Series 2003-12:
    

      --Class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
