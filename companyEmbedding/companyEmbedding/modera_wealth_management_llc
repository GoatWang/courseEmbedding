A Consultative Approach
We sit side by side with you to gain a clear understanding of your big picture, and then develop a customized plan and a process geared to helping you meet your unique goals and needs.

Portfolio management and asset allocation
Cash flow and savings analysis
Estate planning
Tax planning and tax reduction strategies

Wealth Management for Your Needs
No two people are alike. No two plans are alike. Only after a thorough analysis of your unique set of goals and financial picture do we begin to develop wealth management strategies specifically tailored for you. Whether you are interested in planning for retirement, establishing a steady cash flow, or funding your grandchildren’s education, your plan is customized according to your varied needs and changing circumstances.
Integrated Coordination
Our extensive financial planning services include investment management, cash flow analysis, retirement income planning, tax planning, education funding, estate planning, insurance analysis, strategic goal planning, and many other areas of wealth management. These broad capabilities allow us to take an integrated approach and address both fundamental and complex financial situations with clarity and efficiency. Whenever possible, we also collaborate with your accountant, lawyer, and other professional advisors, or recommend trusted advisors, to see to it that your strategies are coordinated for your best interests.
On-going Responsive Guidance
Developing an integrated plan and investment allocation is only the first step of any financial journey. The real value comes in having a team of experienced industry professionals assisting you along the way to implement strategies and be able to respond to your changing conditions and objectives. We are your on-going partners, helping you make informed financial decisions and constantly seeking new opportunities to optimize your plan.
Long-Term Focus
We believe that consistency and stability are the cornerstones of success. Therefore, we take a long-term view with our client relationships. Through constancy of purpose and clarity of direction, we develop plans designed for you at every stage, now and into the future.
Our wealth management services are designed to be comprehensive and intended for clients with at least $1 million in investment assets.   Alternatively, in select cases where a prospective client has entered the rapid accumulation phase, our services may also be appropriate. This may apply to some licensed professionals and other business owners who have reinvested heavily in their businesses and now need to diversify separately from their core businesses.  We invite you to contact us for an initial consultation to explore if we should work together. If we are not the right firm for you, we would be more than happy to refer you to a fee-only firm that may be more appropriate.

Approach
Financial Planning Process
Investment Process
Investment Philosophy







Comprehensive& Responsive 




 







Investment Process
Goal: Construct portfolio to provide return objectives while minimizing risks

We work to provide our clients with these key benefits:
Maintain control of your financial future
Reduce the amount of time to manage your wealth
Select investments most likely to help achieve your objectives
Accommodate risk tolerance level and any unique constraints
Control investment expenses
Effectively manage tax liability
Stay abreast of new investment developments and products
Update your investment strategy as appropriate
Reduce unnecessary investment risks
 

 



 




Evaluate Current Goals and Objectives
Working closely with you, we will assess your current financial condition and objectives, as well as your risk tolerance. We will develop a long-term strategy designed to align with your objectives and risk parameters.
Develop Investment Policy
We will prepare a personalized Invesment Policy Statement (IPS), complete with expected rate of return targets, allocation guidelines, liquidity needs and rebalancing procedures. Ongoing investment decisions are based on the IPS, and its appropriateness will be reviewed on a regular basis.
Implement Portfolio Design
Modera will recommend specific strategies and investments to implement your asset allocation plan. We consider the optimal tax location of each investment if you have tax-deferred and taxable accounts. We also factor in possible capital gains or losses. The execution strategy will depend on specific asset allocation as well as liquidity, tax, cost and other considerations that have been reviewed in the planning process.
Manage Portfolio
Once the portfolio design is implemented, we will work to control risk by monitoring the underlying investments and periodically rebalancing to the target asset class weight. Rebalancing occurs on the basis of how far markets have moved the portolio allocation from the target. We utilize robust portfolio management and rebalancing technologies that allow for the monitoring and oversight of all portfolio holdings and their allocations for the assets we manage.
Measure and Report Results
Periodic reviews of needs, circumstances, and requirements are critical to help an investment plan succeed. On a quarterly basis, we will provide you with a succinct analysis of the performance and risk of your portfolio. You also will receive monthly account statements and transaction confirmations from the independent custodian holding your accounts.

WESTWOOD, N.J., Jan. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Modera Wealth Management, LLC was named a Best Place to Work in Money Management for 2016 by Pensions & Investments.  Modera is one of 50 national honorees in this category.  Modera won this award in 2012 as well.


Modera Wealth Management, LLC (Modera) is a fee-only, independent wealth management firm that works with individuals, families, retirement plan sponsors, and non-profit institutions in the areas of portfolio management, retirement planning, estate planning, income tax planning and risk analysis. Specialized services are also offered for corporate executives and small business owners. The firm has offices in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida and Georgia and manages over $2 billion in client assets as of January 1, 2017.
Greg Plechner, Principal and Wealth Manager said, "We are honored to once again be recognized for our firm culture and workplace. This award is especially meaningful to us because it comes from our staff. It is a true testament to the firm culture we've all established together."  George Padula, Principal and Wealth Manager, added,  "As stated in our firm values and evident every day in our culture, we focus on the importance of family, and consider clients and staff members to be an extension of our own families."
Pension and Investments has noted several ways that Modera has exemplified the integration of company and community.  Modera has a Philanthropy Committee which selects a unified theme for each of its four offices to address firm-sponsored philanthropic endeavors.  In 2016, the committee selected cancer support and awareness.  In 2017, the firm will dedicate its charitable efforts to financial literacy for underserved youth.  Modera continuously looks for ways to enhance staff interactions among its four offices.  For example, the firm has sponsored firm-wide retreats focused on team-building, garnering a 100% participant rate.  At the local level, a "fun committee" at each office location organizes social events for staff.  Formal educational seminars are available for staff to acquire personal finance insights from CFP® professionals.
Pensions & Investments partnered with Best Companies Group, an independent research firm specializing in identifying great places to work, to conduct a two-part survey process of employers and their employees.   The first part consisted of evaluating each nominated company's workplace policies, practices, philosophy, systems and demographics. This part of the process was worth approximately 25% of the total evaluation. The second part consisted of an employee survey to measure the employee experience. This part of the process was worth approximately 75% of the total evaluation. The combined scores determined the top companies. For a complete list of the 2016 Pensions & Investments Best Places to Work in Money Management winners and write-ups, go to www.pionline.com/BPTW2016.

The Modera Advantage

As a comprehensive wealth management firm, we strive to provide the highest quality of services to individuals, estates, trusts, charitable organizations and small businesses in all areas of financial planning.
 
Placing Your Needs First.

At Modera, you will receive advice that is objective and free of conflicts-of-interests. As a firm we are able to put the financial needs of our clients first and foremost because:
 
• Our compensation is 100% fee-only. That means that we do not earn commissions or otherwise profit from the sale of financial products. 
 
• We also are 100% independently owned, and therefore not affilitated with any company that may put shareholders or third-party interests above the interests of their clients.
 
• We are a fiduciary, which means by law, we are required to put your interests ahead of our own. This is both a legal and ethical standard that we take very seriously and that brokerage firms and many other advisors who work on commission are not required to follow.
 
Expertise

You deserve the most dedicated and experienced team to manage your wealth. At Modera Wealth Management, our depth of expertise is difficult to match in the industry. Our team consists of 34 financial professionals with over 200 years of combined experience and professional credentials including: 
  
• CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM 
• Chartered Life Underwriter 
• CFA Charterholder 
• Certified Public Accountant 
• Enrolled Agent 
• Chartered Accountant 
• Accredited Investment Fiduciaries 
• Chartered Advisor for Senior Living 
• Lawyer 
 
Exceptional Client Services.

As a client of Modera, you have the benefit of large-firm resources, yet still receive the personalized service of a small, boutique firm. In addition to a lead advisor, you will be supported by a team of specialists familiar with your goals and readily available to assist you.

WESTWOOD, N.J. and ATLANTA, Jan. 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Modera Wealth Management, LLC ("Modera") is pleased to announce that effective on January 1, 2017, Cambridge Wealth Counsel ("Cambridge"), an independent, fee-only advisory firm located in Atlanta, Georgia, joined forces with Modera to establish a wealth management firm with over $2 billion in assets under management as of January 1, 2017. Both firms are dedicated to being a fee-only fiduciary, and providing objective advice in the best interests of our clients. 


While informal discussions began several years ago, the principals from both firms have known each other since 2003 through NAPFA (National Association of Personal Financial Advisors) committees, study groups, and frequent cooperative collaboration on various financial planning issues. Professionals from both firms have held leadership roles within NAPFA. Modera has been often cited as an early pioneer of the fee-only approach. 
This combination results in a team of 55 employees, including 28 holding the CFP® designation, 5 with the CFA designation and 3 CPAs. 
Robert Hockett, formerly of Cambridge and now a Modera Principal and Wealth Manager noted:  "Our practice specialties in executive compensation, divorce planning, and serving medical professionals will be a resource to advisors and their clients across the organization. While this combination will enhance the professional expertise of the firm, the personalized relationship we have with each of our clients will be maintained."
Greg Plechner, Principal and Wealth Manager of Modera said: "We remain committed to growing the firm to serve our clients better as well as offer more resources and opportunities for our staff.  As an independently-owned registered investment advisor, Modera is dedicated to providing unbiased financial guidance to our clients. This synergy further supports the firm's continued independence and its commitment to the fee-only approach."
Modera was awarded the 2016 Pensions & Investments Best Places to Work in Money Management award, one of 50 nationally honorees. Modera also won this award in 2012. Modera has been listed among the Financial Times Top 300 Registered Investment Advisors every year since the award's inception in 2014. Inc. Magazine featured the firm as one of America's fastest growing private companies for four years (2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016).   
About Modera Wealth Management, LLCModera Wealth Management, LLC (Modera) is a fee-only, independent wealth management firm that works with individuals, families, endowments, foundations and others in the areas of retirement planning, estate planning, income tax planning, investment management, risk protection, stock option analysis and education planning. Modera Wealth Management traces its roots back to 1983 and has been providing objective, comprehensive wealth and portfolio management advice to clients for more than a quarter century.

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



          1. $4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online. The study found on average that four competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.65 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. For the table, the example competitor trade costs range of $240 - $510 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential between Fidelity and the four selected competitors displayed in the table. Year to date, through September 2015, Fidelity's retail brokerage account holders who purchased individual municipal or corporate bonds, purchased an average of 22 bonds per transaction.
	
    

          3.
	
	
	       
					
Minimum concessions of $19.95 apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S. Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades, reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. dollar–denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply; see Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may affect the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.



          4.
	
	
	       
        Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund’s current prospectus.


          5. Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy and Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. For taxable accounts, Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy may apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques on a limited basis at Strategic Advisers' discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client's account should be bought or sold. As a discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor's account that Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy, Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios, and/or Fidelity® Equity Income Strategy do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          6. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.


There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.


          Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®, Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines, and BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio are services provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. Fidelity® Strategic Disciplines includes the Breckinridge Intermediate Municipal Separately Managed Account, the Fidelity® Equity-Income Strategy, and the Fidelity® Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy. Fidelity GoSM is a service provided by Strategic Advisers, Inc., and by Geode Capital Management LLC, an unaffiliated registered investment adviser. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., or Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank. Nondeposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and its affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These advisory services are provided for a fee.


          Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and members of NYSE and SIPC.
	
    


Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
