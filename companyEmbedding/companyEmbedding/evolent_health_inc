WASHINGTON, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Evolent Health, Inc. (NYSE:   EVH), a company providing an integrated value-based care platform to the nation's leading health systems and physician organizations ("Evolent Health"), today announced the launch of an underwritten secondary public offering of 4,500,000 shares of its Class A common stock to be sold by certain affiliates of TPG Global, LLC, and Ptolemy Capital, LLC (together, the "Selling Stockholders"). 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley are acting as book-running managers and underwriters for the offering.  








Neither Evolent Health nor any of its directors, officers or other stockholders is offering any shares of Class A common stock in the offering. Evolent Health will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the Selling Stockholders.  
A registration statement (including a base prospectus) relating to these securities has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and has become effective. Before you invest, you should read the base prospectus in that registration statement and other documents filed with the SEC for more complete information about Evolent Health and this offering. You may obtain these documents free of charge by visiting EDGAR on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
The offering will be made by means of a preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus.  Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the final prospectus supplement, when available, and the accompanying base prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282, or by telephone at (866) 471-2526, facsimile at (212) 902-9316, or email at prospectus-ny@ny.email.gs.com; or Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these shares of Class A common stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.
About Evolent Health
Evolent Health partners with leading health systems to drive value-based care transformation. By providing clinical, analytical and financial capabilities, Evolent Health helps physicians and health systems achieve superior quality and cost results. Evolent Health's approach breaks down barriers, aligns incentives and powers a new model of care delivery resulting in meaningful alignment between providers, payers, physicians and patients. 
Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language
Certain statements made in this press release and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like:  "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "aim," "predict," "potential," "continue," "plan," "project," "will," "should," "shall," "may," "might" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.  
Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and other documents filed with the SEC include factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this press release.

ABOUT US






Change the Health of the Nation






Evolent Health is comprised of an experienced and committed group of health care professionals, unified by a passion for transforming the way health care is delivered and experienced in America.














Our Mission
We partner with provider organizations, including health systems, physician groups, accountable care organizations, provider-sponsored health plans and pediatric hospitals at all degrees of risk-readiness to achieve clinical and financial success in value-based care. We have the experience needed to drive this transformation as we pursue a singular mission:
 
TO CHANGE THE HEALTH OF THE NATION BY CHANGING THE WAY HEALTH CARE IS DELIVERED





















Meet Our Leaders








“From personal experience, we knew health care could work better for our families—for all families. With this in mind, we founded Evolent and recruited some of the brightest minds across the industry as we seek to make our mission a reality.”

Tom Peterson,
COO and Co-Founder















Our Vision
To support leading provider organizations in gaining the operational scale, financial partnership and clinical capabilities they need to improve health outcomes and lower cost for patients at both the individual- and population-level. Leveraging our centralized support, our partners form a network of progressive health systems that identify, share and implement proven best practices to change the way health care is delivered and experienced in their local communities.














Our Partners in Change Include



























Strategic Pillars






For leading health systems committed to delivering higher quality care at a lower cost, we are the value-based care partner that delivers integrated clinical and financial capabilities to achieve results with confidence.






















Aligned Partner






We invest literally and figuratively in the success of your health system, and in the future of health care. Our payer-neutral approach means there are no conflicts of interest, and no competing lines of business. Our partners’ success is our success—our role is to power the successful implementation of value-based care. We accomplish this through innovation, responsiveness and a passionate commitment to your growth amidst the changing dynamics of the market.




















Clinical Value






Our provider-centric approach begins with our expansive team of clinical experts. We earn the trust and alignment of physicians because we care as much about helping patients as they do. Our understanding of the everyday operations of health systems—and how to improve them—produces a profound transformation in clinical and financial outcomes that puts the patient back at the center of care.




















Full Solution






Transitioning to value-based care is a complex process, and the benefits of doing it right are extraordinary. You need a partner who knows how to align every critical function to ensure success. No matter where you are in your transition, we have the clinical and operational expertise you need to move forward with confidence—and produce tangible results.




















Proven Results

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 13.42 M     Change from Last  -0.26%      Percent of Float 25.92%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.81      Net Money Flow ($)  -110,180    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
