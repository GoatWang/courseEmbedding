First Quarter 2017 Fact Sheet








Investor Relations


ExOne: technology leader for industrial grade additive manufacturing

	ExOne provides 3D printing machines, 3D printed products and related services to industrial customers in multiple segments, including pumps, automotive, aerospace, heavy equipment and energy.

	The ExOne® process, which utilizes binder jetting technology with industrial materials, gives traditional manufacturers an opportunity to reduce costs, lower the risk of trial and error and create opportunities for design innovation.

	We collaborate with our customers through the entire development and production process so that they are able to materialize new concepts — designs, prototypes, and production parts — precisely when needed. Production scale is irrelevant and lot quantities of one are just as efficient as lot quantities of one thousand. ExOne offers both the services and the equipment to enable rapid point-of-use manufacturing.

	We support the use of traditional industrial strength materials ranging from metals to silica sand and ceramics, all used in revolutionary ways. ExOne is the optimal partner for any industrial manufacturer who is transitioning their manufacturing business to the digital age.

ExOne: technology leader for industrial grade additive manufacturing

	ExOne provides 3D printing machines, 3D printed products and related services to industrial customers in multiple segments, including pumps, automotive, aerospace, heavy equipment and energy.

	The ExOne® process, which utilizes binder jetting technology with industrial materials, gives traditional manufacturers an opportunity to reduce costs, lower the risk of trial and error and create opportunities for design innovation.

	We collaborate with our customers through the entire development and production process so that they are able to materialize new concepts — designs, prototypes, and production parts — precisely when needed. Production scale is irrelevant and lot quantities of one are just as efficient as lot quantities of one thousand. ExOne offers both the services and the equipment to enable rapid point-of-use manufacturing.

	We support the use of traditional industrial strength materials ranging from metals to silica sand and ceramics, all used in revolutionary ways. ExOne is the optimal partner for any industrial manufacturer who is transitioning their manufacturing business to the digital age.

About ExOne



Technology leader for industrial grade additive manufacturing.









	ExOne, a publicly traded manufacturing technology company, provides 3D printing machines, 3D printed products and related services to industrial customers in multiple segments, including pumps, automotive, aerospace, heavy equipment and energy.

The ExOne® process, which utilizes Binder Jetting technology with industrial materials, gives traditional manufacturers an opportunity to reduce costs, lower the risk of trial and error and create opportunities for design innovation.








	We collaborate with our customers through the entire development and production process so that they are able to materialize new concepts — designs, prototypes, and production parts — precisely when needed. Production scale is irrelevant and lot quantities of one are just as efficient as lot quantities of one thousand. ExOne offers both the services and the equipment to enable rapid point-of-use manufacturing.

We support the use of traditional industrial strength materials ranging from metals to silica sand and ceramics, all used in revolutionary ways. ExOne is the optimal partner for any industrial manufacturer who is transitioning their manufacturing business to the digital age.

Which application?


Castings
Filtration
Pumps
Other



















Castings
Increased uniformity and improved accuracy.
ExOne has made significant investment into its 3D printing technology for the manufacture of sand molds and cores to provide a cost-effective and time-reducing alternative to traditional methods for creating prototype and low-volume castings. Metal castings are universally used for industrial, military and consumer products and are increasingly being evaluated for cost-effective applications in new product development programs.
More Information >








Filtration
A new dimension of design freedom and flexibility in powder size.
ExOne has produced 3D printed metal filter components for strainers and metallic filter applications. Strainers are often exposed to abrasive solutions which can shorten part life, and traditionally are welded multi-piece assemblies. By 3D printing strainer plates, manufacturers are able to take advantage of the increased wear characteristics of ExOne materials, and the ability to create parts in a single piece, eliminating waste and improving part quality and efficiency.
More Information >








Pumps
Concurrent iterations can be achieved in a matter of weeks.
For pump applications, ExOne has dramatically improved hydraulic balancing of impeller castings and produced quick turnaround times for one-off castings and 3D printed metal components. Concurrent iterations can be achieved in a matter of weeks. Additive manufacturing is also the ideal application for reverse engineering of legacy pump components and reduces the need for physical warehouse space for patterns, since data files can be stored on a hard drive.
More Information >








Other Applications
 From kitchen  fittings to prosthetics
The ability to easily implement design changes and customization with 3D Printing has led to its application in the manufacture of prosthetics which require easily adaptable design modifications and prototype iterations. ExOne customers have realized significant reduction in costs, the benefits of freedom of design and consistent delivery schedules.
