Xerox Names Ashok Vemuri as CEO of Post-Separation Business Process Outsourcing Company

Jun 14, 2016
      
        —
        
      
      Corporate, 
      
      Services & Outsourcing, 
      
      Conduent Inc.


NORWALK, Conn. —  Xerox (NYSE: XRX) announced today that Ashok Vemuri will become the chief executive officer of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) company upon the completion of the separation of Xerox into two publicly-traded companies. Vemuri will join Xerox effective July 1, 2016 and serve as chief executive officer of Xerox Business Services, LLC and an executive vice president of Xerox Corporation until the separation is complete.
“Ashok’s deep industry experience and proven track record of leading growth and corporate transformations will be instrumental for the BPO company’s future success,” said Xerox chairman and CEO Ursula Burns. “He’s an excellent leader with the right combination of operational, financial and client experience to successfully drive our BPO company’s go-forward strategy. I look forward to working with Ashok to successfully launch the new BPO company and build on its position as an industry leader.”
Vemuri served as president and chief executive officer of IGATE Corporation from September 2013 to October 2015. In this role, Vemuri transformed the company’s operations, go-to-market strategy and balance sheet and ultimately executed a highly-successful, strategic sale of the company to Capgemini. Prior to joining IGATE, Vemuri was a senior executive at Infosys where he served as a Board member, head of Americas and the global leader of Manufacturing and Engineering Services.
“I’m excited to join Xerox at this stage of its new path forward. Xerox’s BPO business is already in several attractive markets and has an impressive client list that includes top global brands and vital government agencies. The standalone BPO company will have many new opportunities, leveraging its differentiated capabilities and executing a more focused value-creation strategy for the benefit of clients, employees and shareholders,” Vemuri said.
On January 29, 2016, Xerox announced its plans to separate into two independent, publicly-traded companies – a Document Technology company comprised of its Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses and a BPO company. Xerox is targeting to file its initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July. The transaction is on track to be completed by the end of 2016.
The BPO company will be an industry leader that helps businesses and governments manage transaction intensive processes at a large scale. With approximately $7 billion in 2015 revenue – more than 90% of which is annuity based – the company is focused on attractive growth markets including transportation, healthcare, commercial and government services.
The Document Technology company, which delivered $11 billion in 2015 revenue, will be a global leader in document management and document outsourcing with superior technology, solutions and innovations.

Ashok Vemuri joins Xerox as the chief executive officer of Xerox Business Services, LLC and executive vice president of Xerox, effective July 1, 2016. After the completion of Xerox’s planned separation, Vemuri will serve as the chief executive officer and a director of the new BPO company.
Vemuri previously was president, chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of IGATE Corporation, a New Jersey-based global technology and services company now part of global technology and outsourcing company Capgemini. During his tenure from 2013 to 2015, Vemuri successfully transformed the company’s organization, go-to-market strategy, brand and balance sheet. He oversaw the company becoming the only IT services company to make the Fortune 100 Fastest Growing companies in 2014.
Before joining IGATE, Vemuri spent fourteen years at Infosys, a multinational consulting and IT services company, in a variety of leadership and business development roles. From 2012 to 2013, he served as senior vice president and head of Americas and global head of Manufacturing and Engineering Services.  Vemuri was a member of the board from 2011 to 2013. He was also the key architect of the company’s vertical go-to-market model.
Prior to joining Infosys in 1999, he worked in the investment banking industry at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America.
Vemuri is a member of the World Economic Forum IT Board of Governors. He won the Board of Enterprise Asia Outstanding Entrepreneur Award and IAIR Businessman of the Year award in 2015. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in physics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi and received his MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

Early life and education[edit]
Ashok Vemuri was born on April 22, 1968,[1] and spent his childhood in India.[2][3] He received a bachelor's degree[4] in physics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi.[5] Vemuri subsequently completed his master's degree[4] in business management at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad,[5][4][6] where he also earned his postgraduate diploma.[4]
Career[edit]
Early positions and Infosys (1992-2013)[edit]
In 1992[7] Vemuri began working in investment banking at Deutsche Bank AG[8] and Bank of America.[5] Vemuri joined Infosys[7][7] in 1999,[4] where he went on to work closely with[5] and be mentored by Narayana Murthy,[7] the co-founder and then-CEO of the company.[5] As of May 2003, Vemuri was serving as vice president and regional manager of sales for Canada and the northeast region of the United States.[9] After management changes in June 2009, Forbes India reported that "Subhash Dhar, Ashok Vemuri, V. Balakrishnan and B.G. Srinivas... are now coming under [the limelight at Infosys]. These five are among a band of leaders being groomed to take over from the founding team."[10] Vemuri was soon serving as a senior vice president[11] of Infosys,[4] and became a member of the company's executive council.[11]
Vemuri went on to hold management roles at Infosys. For a time he served as chairman of the company’s operations in China,[5] also serving on the boards of Infosys in the Americas[7] and Infosys Public Services.[5] Beyond heading Infosys' operations in Canada and eastern North America,[4] he furthermore headed both the Financial Services & Insurance Business division and the Banking, Capital Markets & Strategic Global Sourcing division.[4] Vemuri was appointed to the board of Infosys in June 2011, while retaining his roles as senior vice president and chief of the banking division.[12] Infosys appointed Vemuri the global head of its Manufacturing & Engineering Services division in April 2012.[4] Despite speculation in the press that Infosys was considering Vemuri as a choice for CEO,[6] in September 2013[4][4][13][13] the press reported that he would instead by joining iGATE.[13]
Work with iGATE (2013-2014)[edit]
On September 16, 2013, Vemuri was appointed CEO and president[4] of the IT services provider iGATE,[4][13] Early in his tenure, Vemuri assured shareholders that the $770 million in debt accrued by iGATE in 2011 would be dealt with in the "near-term," and by March 2014 iGATE had raised $325 million to repay part of the debt.[14]
After the company beat analysts expectations for first quarter earnings in 2014,[14] that April the Economic Times reported that Vemuri had "abandoned the lofty revenue target set by his predecessor" in an effort to set "short-term, achievable growth targets for the company."[14] In the first half of 2014, under Vemuri, iGATE engaged in a "hiring for growth" program and added 2,500 employees, bringing the headcount to 32,742 employees by June 2014.[15] In July 2014, Vemuri was credited with securing a deal with CNA Financial, estimated to be worth around $200 million.[15]
Capgemini acquisition (2015)[edit]
By March 2015, iGATE's stock value had increased since the start of Vemuri's tenure,[16] with the company reaching a market capitalization of $3.3 billion.[16] iGATE also had around 33,000 employees and revenues of about $1.3 billion,[1] much higher than the annual revenue of $851.6 million from 2013.[16] During his first eighteen months at iGATE, the press noted that Vemuri had helped "the firm’s market capitalisation increase almost three times."[6] In April 2015, the French IT company CapGemini announced it would buy iGATE for USD $4 billion, creating a larger company with clients such as General Electric and Royal Bank of Canada.[17][18] Vemuri led iGATE's side of the sale,[19][20] and in July 2015 was voted into Capgemini's group management board.[17] Vemuri resigned as iGATE CEO in October 2015.[4][20]
Conduent CEO (2016)[edit]
Xerox Corporation announced on June 14, 2016 that Vemuri had been chosen as the CEO of Conduent, Xerox's business process outsourcing unit,[19][20] which will be separated as a new independent company[1] later that year.[19] The outsourcing division had been struggling to meet its financial benchmarks, with the Economic Times opining that "Xerox is betting on IT industry veteran Vemuri's experience to help the company revive its outsourcing business." Xerox chairman and CEO Ursula Burns stated Vemuri had been selected because of his "deep industry experience and proven track record of leading growth and corporate transformations."[21] Vemuri was appointed executive vice president and CEO[1] of Xerox Business Services LLC, effective July 1.[4] He will become the CEO of Conduent after the separation of Xerox into two companies.[22]
Boards and memberships[edit]
Vemuri served on the board of directors for a number companies.[4] Vemuri was elected to the Forum of Young Global Leaders (YGL) by the World Economic Forum in 2009,[5][23][24] and from June 2011 until September 2013 he served on the board of Infosys Limited. While with Infosys, he also had tenures on the boards of Infosys Consulting, Infosys Public Services, and Infosys Technologies (China) Company Limited. From September 2013 until October 2015 he served on the board of iGATE Corporation, also joining the board of iGate Global Solutions on September 17, 2013.

Balakrishnan and B.G. Srinivas... are now coming under [the limelight at Infosys]. These five are among a band of leaders being groomed to take over from the founding team."[10] Vemuri was soon serving as a senior vice president[11] of Infosys,[4] and became a member of the company's executive council.[11]
Vemuri went on to hold management roles at Infosys. For a time he served as chairman of the company’s operations in China,[5] also serving on the boards of Infosys in the Americas[7] and Infosys Public Services.[5] Beyond heading Infosys' operations in Canada and eastern North America,[4] he furthermore headed both the Financial Services & Insurance Business division and the Banking, Capital Markets & Strategic Global Sourcing division.[4] Vemuri was appointed to the board of Infosys in June 2011, while retaining his roles as senior vice president and chief of the banking division.[12] Infosys appointed Vemuri the global head of its Manufacturing & Engineering Services division in April 2012.[4] Despite speculation in the press that Infosys was considering Vemuri as a choice for CEO,[6] in September 2013[4][4][13][13] the press reported that he would instead by joining iGATE.[13]

After the company beat analysts expectations for first quarter earnings in 2014,[14] that April the Economic Times reported that Vemuri had "abandoned the lofty revenue target set by his predecessor" in an effort to set "short-term, achievable growth targets for the company."[14] In the first half of 2014, under Vemuri, iGATE engaged in a "hiring for growth" program and added 2,500 employees, bringing the headcount to 32,742 employees by June 2014.[15] In July 2014, Vemuri was credited with securing a deal with CNA Financial, estimated to be worth around $200 million.[15]

Xerox chairman and CEO Ursula Burns stated Vemuri had been selected because of his "deep industry experience and proven track record of leading growth and corporate transformations."[21] Vemuri was appointed executive vice president and CEO[1] of Xerox Business Services LLC, effective July 1.[4] He will become the CEO of Conduent after the separation of Xerox into two companies.[22]

Vemuri served on the board of directors for a number companies.[4] Vemuri was elected to the Forum of Young Global Leaders (YGL) by the World Economic Forum in 2009,[5][23][24] and from June 2011 until September 2013 he served on the board of Infosys Limited.

Early life and education[edit]
Ashok Vemuri was born on April 22, 1968,[1] and spent his childhood in India.[2][3] He received a bachelor's degree[4] in physics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi.[5] Vemuri subsequently completed his master's degree[4] in business management at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad,[5][4][6] where he also earned his postgraduate diploma.[4]
Career[edit]
Early positions and Infosys (1992-2013)[edit]
In 1992[7] Vemuri began working in investment banking at Deutsche Bank AG[8] and Bank of America.[5] Vemuri joined Infosys[7][7] in 1999,[4] where he went on to work closely with[5] and be mentored by Narayana Murthy,[7] the co-founder and then-CEO of the company.[5] As of May 2003, Vemuri was serving as vice president and regional manager of sales for Canada and the northeast region of the United States.[9] After management changes in June 2009, Forbes India reported that "Subhash Dhar, Ashok Vemuri, V. Balakrishnan and B.G. Srinivas... are now coming under [the limelight at Infosys]. These five are among a band of leaders being groomed to take over from the founding team."[10] Vemuri was soon serving as a senior vice president[11] of Infosys,[4] and became a member of the company's executive council.[11]
Vemuri went on to hold management roles at Infosys. For a time he served as chairman of the company’s operations in China,[5] also serving on the boards of Infosys in the Americas[7] and Infosys Public Services.[5] Beyond heading Infosys' operations in Canada and eastern North America,[4] he furthermore headed both the Financial Services & Insurance Business division and the Banking, Capital Markets & Strategic Global Sourcing division.[4] Vemuri was appointed to the board of Infosys in June 2011, while retaining his roles as senior vice president and chief of the banking division.[12] Infosys appointed Vemuri the global head of its Manufacturing & Engineering Services division in April 2012.[4] Despite speculation in the press that Infosys was considering Vemuri as a choice for CEO,[6] in September 2013[4][4][13][13] the press reported that he would instead by joining iGATE.[13]
Work with iGATE (2013-2014)[edit]
On September 16, 2013, Vemuri was appointed CEO and president[4] of the IT services provider iGATE,[4][13] Early in his tenure, Vemuri assured shareholders that the $770 million in debt accrued by iGATE in 2011 would be dealt with in the "near-term," and by March 2014 iGATE had raised $325 million to repay part of the debt.[14]
After the company beat analysts expectations for first quarter earnings in 2014,[14] that April the Economic Times reported that Vemuri had "abandoned the lofty revenue target set by his predecessor" in an effort to set "short-term, achievable growth targets for the company."[14] In the first half of 2014, under Vemuri, iGATE engaged in a "hiring for growth" program and added 2,500 employees, bringing the headcount to 32,742 employees by June 2014.[15] In July 2014, Vemuri was credited with securing a deal with CNA Financial, estimated to be worth around $200 million.[15]
Capgemini acquisition (2015)[edit]
By March 2015, iGATE's stock value had increased since the start of Vemuri's tenure,[16] with the company reaching a market capitalization of $3.3 billion.[16] iGATE also had around 33,000 employees and revenues of about $1.3 billion,[1] much higher than the annual revenue of $851.6 million from 2013.[16] During his first eighteen months at iGATE, the press noted that Vemuri had helped "the firm’s market capitalisation increase almost three times."[6] In April 2015, the French IT company CapGemini announced it would buy iGATE for USD $4 billion, creating a larger company with clients such as General Electric and Royal Bank of Canada.[17][18] Vemuri led iGATE's side of the sale,[19][20] and in July 2015 was voted into Capgemini's group management board.[17] Vemuri resigned as iGATE CEO in October 2015.[4][20]
Conduent CEO (2016)[edit]
Xerox Corporation announced on June 14, 2016 that Vemuri had been chosen as the CEO of Conduent, Xerox's business process outsourcing unit,[19][20] which will be separated as a new independent company[1] later that year.[19] The outsourcing division had been struggling to meet its financial benchmarks, with the Economic Times opining that "Xerox is betting on IT industry veteran Vemuri's experience to help the company revive its outsourcing business." Xerox chairman and CEO Ursula Burns stated Vemuri had been selected because of his "deep industry experience and proven track record of leading growth and corporate transformations."[21] Vemuri was appointed executive vice president and CEO[1] of Xerox Business Services LLC, effective July 1.[4] He will become the CEO of Conduent after the separation of Xerox into two companies.[22]
Boards and memberships[edit]
Vemuri served on the board of directors for a number companies.[4] Vemuri was elected to the Forum of Young Global Leaders (YGL) by the World Economic Forum in 2009,[5][23][24] and from June 2011 until September 2013 he served on the board of Infosys Limited. While with Infosys, he also had tenures on the boards of Infosys Consulting, Infosys Public Services, and Infosys Technologies (China) Company Limited. From September 2013 until October 2015 he served on the board of iGATE Corporation, also joining the board of iGate Global Solutions on September 17, 2013. Vemuri joined the Board of IT Governors at the World Economic Forum[4] in 2014,[2] and Capgemini's group management board in July 2015.[17] He served on the board of visitors of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University.[25]

Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri Talks Splitting From Xerox | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantAshok Vemuri, chief executive officer of Conduent Inc., center, smiles as Tom Farley, president to the NYSE Group Inc., center right, applauds during the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017.  Michael Nagle—Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPointCloudConduent CEO Talks Splitting From Xerox and Competing with IBM and HPEJonathan VanianJan 03, 2017It's a new beginning for Xerox's spawn.Xerox's sibling business services unit, Conduent, spun off into a separate company on Tuesday. It must now find a way to lift its growth amid stagnant sales and a tough market.Xerox acquired the roots of Conduent, which handles everything from human resources services for healthcare companies to mobile parking apps for the city of Los Angeles, by buying Affiliated Computer Services for nearly $6.4 billion in 2010. The deal was supposed to help Xerox find another source of revenue beyond it's core copier and printing business.But like other big business tech companies like IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Xerox's overall revenue has declined in recent years. With few people printing and copying, Xerox's annual sales have dropped each year since 2011.During much of that time, Xerox's business services group struggled. In a nine-month period ending in September, Conduent had $4.9 billion in revenue, or nearly flat compared to the previous year.Xerox's executives say that two smaller, more nimble businesses will be able to better adapt to a rapidly changing technology world. The argument echoes that of Hewlett Packard, which split into two companies last year.But Wall Street didn't exactly give Conduent a happy birthday. In its first day of trading, the company's shares fell 8% to $13.72.In this edited interview with Fortune, Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri talks about splitting from Xerox (xrx), competing with IBM (ibm) and HPE (hpe), and new beginnings.Fortune: Tell me about splitting from Xerox.RelatedFortune 500Amazon’s Video Content and India Investments Cause Profit to Fall 77%Fortune 500Amazon’s Video Content and India Investments Cause Profit to Fall 77%Vemuri: If you go back six to seven years when Xerox acquired a company called ACS [Affiliated Computer Services] in 2010, the thesis of that acquisition was that Xerox was a hardware manufacturing company. This was during a recession, and management thought the best would be to serve your clients soup-to-nuts, if you will, by acquiring a services company.It was very similar to other companies—think Dell with Perot [$3.9 billion deal was announced in 2009], HP with EDS [$13.9 billion deal was announced in 2008] That construct of combining hardware with services didn’t necessarily pan out. So, it was thought that our two companies would be better served if they were sliced off and were allowed to control their own destiny and serve their own clients, their own market, their own technology, etc.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.Why did hardware companies think that they also had to have business services?It was the height of the recession. This was considered a sort of natural hedge in terms of buying revenue. Secondly, it was believed that if you sold a piece of equipment to a client, they were servicing that equipment with somebody else. So why would I not, if I sold you that equipment, service it instead? Thirdly, services companies were on the ascendancy. Remember, even 10 years ago, print, paper, ink was on decline, and it continues to be so. The services business is where the margins are—where the cash flow is—and your need for spending is much less. If you look at an equipment provider like Xerox, it’s more a finance operating lease company, because they fund your purchase of a printer. A services business is asset light. It does not require you to invest your balance sheet in a big way.Some analysts believe the downside of a service company, however, are the costs of hiring employees, which can eat into profitability.That’s wrong. That is the conventional way of thinking about services businesses. In our model, 80% of our business is transactions based. We do everything off the back of technology. That allows me to add a multitude of services off a particular platform. Let me give you an example. If I have three or four clients, I cannot repurpose my people because they aren’t fungible. I can’t say, “Hey, for two hours you be on the call center, for two hours you do transaction processing, for two hours you work for Client A, and for two hours you work for Client B.” But I can do it if I do it on the back of technology, because my platform aggregates and creates air pockets that allow me to work for multiple clients. I can repurpose my platform to do multiple functions. With people, I can’t expect them to work more than eight hours.What are the services that your company does?We serve two broad segments. One is the public sector. We work with all 50 U.S. states and over 500 government entities worldwide. We do a lot of work in transportation. Think about parking: You use a parking app pay over the phone, and the phone reminds you after 45 minutes to pay more We are now handling road tolls—so think EasyPass in California and SunPass in Florida.We are the world’s largest prepaid card processor. We do things like welfare, Social Security, Food Stamps. The other part of the business is commercial. We work with 74 of the top Fortune 100 companies. We support them on mission-critical systems.Apple (aapl) co-founder Steve Jobs once publicly criticized Xerox for not capitalizing on its technology.Correct. In a similar way, a lot of Conduent’s technology was invented in Xerox over the last six years. The ACS story is six years old; a little is left, but a lot of that is new and a lot of that was invented in Xerox.Now that you’re an independent company, how do you balance spending on research into new technologies with pleasing investors?Clearly today, technology is at a place where you don’t necessarily have to build components in-house; you can buy them from others. We have to rid ourselves of the sensibility we’ve had that if it’s not invented in-house it’s not worth looking at. We are now a public company, so our research dollars have to give a return in the year that I give the dollar in, unlike in the past in which the time to yield was like five to seven years.Having said that, technology will be the underpinning of every process we bring. Therefore we must invest in our technology platform and make it modern. The speed of technology is changing and the way it is being consumed is dramatically changing in such a short time frame that our investments have to reflect that time horizon as well as the fact that these changes are happening.Who are your biggest competitors?We are in a wide range of industries, so we have a lot of them. A lot of them are very niche and specialized companies. Across our various businesses, we see as competitors like Accenture, we see IBM, we see HPE. My advantage is I’m a pure-play business process provider. I’m the largest in revenue and in size and scale.For more about enterprise technology, watch:How do you distinguish yourselves from the big business services groups of companies like IBM that may brag that their technology separates them from the pack?Technology is a commodity. I can buy technology every other day at half the price I paid the day before yesterday. The technology product isn’t going to give you any differentiation. What gives you differentiation is what you do with that technology.
