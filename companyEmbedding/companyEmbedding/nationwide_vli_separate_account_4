DISTRIBUTION
  SERVICES AGREEMENT
�

This
  Distribution Services Agreement
  (�Agreement�) is made as of June 5, 2007 by and between Lincoln Financial
  Distributors, Inc. (the �Distributor�), and
  Nationwide�Investment Services Corp. (the
�Broker-Dealer�), an Oklahoma corporation.

Recitals

WHEREAS,
  the Distributor has been
  appointed and currently serves as the principal underwriter of Lincoln Variable
  Insurance Products Trust (the �Trust�), a Delaware statutory trust, and each of
  its series listed in Schedule A (the �Funds�), pursuant to an underwriting
  agreement by and between Distributor and the Trust;

WHEREAS,
  each Fund currently offers
  Standard Class shares and Service Class shares and has adopted a Service Class
  Distribution and Service Plan (the �12b-1 Plan�) applicable to its Service Class
  shares; and

WHEREAS,
  the Broker-Dealer serves as
  the principal underwriter of certain variable annuity and/or variable life
  insurance contracts issued by an affiliated insurance company (the �Contracts�),
  and Broker-Dealer�desires to provide certain services in
  connection with the Contracts that offer Service Class shares of the Funds
  as
  underlying investment options of the Contracts.

Agreement

1.��Services
  of the
  Broker-Dealer
�
a.���The
  Broker-Dealer shall, as
  agreed upon by the parties from time to time, provide certain services or incur
  certain expenses relating to the Service Class shares of the Funds for
  activities primarily intended to sell Contracts offering Service Class
  shares.��These services or expenses are the printing and mailing of
  Fund prospectuses and reports used for sales purposes and the payment of service
  fees as defined under NASD rules.
�
b.��The
  Broker-Dealer may, at its expense,
  subcontract with any entity or person concerning the provision of the services
  contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that the Broker-Dealer shall not
  be
  relieved of any of its obligations under this Agreement by the appointment
  of
  such subcontractor and provided further, that the Broker-Dealer shall be
  responsible, to the extent provided in Section 5 hereof, for all acts of such
  subcontractor as if such acts were its own.
�
c.��The
  Broker-Dealer will furnish to the
  Trust or its designee such information as the Trust or its designee may
  reasonably request, and will otherwise cooperate with the Trust in preparation
  of reports to the Trust�s Board of Trustees concerning this Agreement, as well
  as any other reports or filings that may be required by law.
�

2.�������������Fees
�
In
  consideration of the services provided by Broker-Dealer with respect to each
  Fund�s Service Class shares pursuant to the 12b-1 Plan, the Distributor agrees,
  to the extent legally permissible, to: (1) pay to the Broker-Dealer quarterly
  in
  arrears a fee (the �Fee�) which shall accrue daily in an amount equal to the
  product of (A) the daily equivalent of [X.XX%] per annum multiplied by (B)
  the
  net asset value of the Service Class shares outstanding on such
  day.��Such Fee shall be paid quarterly (on a calendar year basis) in
  arrears within thirty (30) days of the end of the quarter; provided, however,
  that Broker-Dealer shall waive payment of the Fee until the Distributor is
  in
  receipt of the Fee.��Documentation to support the calculation of this
  Fee will be provided to the Broker-Dealer�along with the
  payment.��The rate of the Fee with respect to any Fund may be
  prospectively increased or decreased by the Trust, in its sole discretion,
  at
  any time upon notice to the Broker-Dealer.

3.��Nature
  of Services
�
The
  Distributor and the Broker-Dealer agree that the Distributor�s payments pursuant
  to this Agreement are only for the services listed in Section 1(a) herein and
  do
  not constitute payment in any manner for investment advisory services or for
  administrative services.��The Distributor and the
  Broker-Dealer�agree that this Agreement does not preclude
  the Trust or Distributor from contracting separately with the
  Broker-Dealer�to provide other services to the Trust or
  Distributor.

4.��Representations
  and
  Warranties
�
a.��The
  Broker-Dealer agrees to comply with
  requirements of all applicable laws, including federal and state securities
  laws, the rules and regulations of the SEC in connection with its performance
  under this Agreement.
�
b.��The
  Broker-Dealer agrees not to act as
  dealer for its own account; the Broker-Dealer shall act solely for, upon the
  specific or pre-authorized instructions of, and for the account of, Contract
  owners.��For all purposes of this Agreement, the Broker-Dealer will be
  deemed to be an independent contractor, and will have no authority to act as
  agent for the Trust or any dealer of the shares of the Funds in any matter
  or in
  any respect.��Broker-Dealer shall not make any representations
  concerning the Trust or a Fund�s shares except those representations contained
  in the Fund�s then-current prospectus and statement of additional information
  and in such printed information as the Trust may subsequently prepare, unless
  otherwise agreed to by the parties to this Agreement or pursuant to the
  Participation Agreement.
�
5.��Exculpation
  and
  Indemnification
�
a.��The
  Broker-Dealer agrees that under no
  circumstances shall the Trust or the Distributor be liable to the Broker-Dealer
  or any other person under this Agreement as a result of any action by the SEC
  affecting the operation or continuation of the 12b-1 Plan.
�
b.��The
  Distributor shall not be liable to
  the Broker-Dealer, and the Broker-Dealer shall not be liable to the Distributor,
  for acts or failures committed pursuant to its performance of the Agreement
  except for acts or failures which constitute lack of good faith or gross
  negligence and for obligations expressly assumed by either party
  hereunder.��Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to operate
  as a waiver by the Distributor or by the Broker-Dealer of compliance with any
  applicable law, rule, or regulation.
�
c.��The
  Broker-Dealer will indemnify the
  Trust and Distributor and hold each harmless from any claims or assertions
  relating to the lawfulness of the Broker-Dealer�s participation in this
  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to any activities
  of any persons or entities affiliated with the Broker-Dealer performed in
  connection with the discharge of its responsibilities under this
  Agreement.��If any such claims are asserted, the Trust and the
  Distributor shall each have the right to manage its own defense, including
  the
  selection and engagement of legal counsel of its choosing, and all costs of
  such
  defense shall be borne by the Broker-Dealer.
�
6.��Termination
�
a.��Unless
  sooner terminated with respect
  to any Fund, this Agreement will continue with respect to a Fund only if the
  continuance of a form of this Agreement is specifically approved at least
  annually by the vote of a majority of the members of the Trust�s Board of
  Trustees who are not �interested persons� (as such term is defined in the
  Investment Broker-Dealer Act of 1940 (the �1940 Act�)) who have no direct or
  indirect financial interest in the 12b-1 Plan relating to such Fund or any
  agreement relating to such 12b-1 Plan, including this Agreement, (the
�Independent Trustees�) cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
  voting on such approval.��This Agreement may be terminated with
  respect to any Fund at any time without penalty by the vote of a majority of
  the
  Independent Trustees, or by a vote of a majority of the Service Class shares
  of
  such Fund on 60 days� written notice.
�
b.��This
  Agreement will automatically
  terminate with respect to a Fund in the event of its assignment (as such term
  is
  defined in the 1940 Act) with respect to such Fund.��This Agreement
  may be terminated with respect to any Fund by the Trust, the Distributor or
  the
  Broker-Dealer, without penalty, upon 60 days� prior written notice to the other
  party.
�
7.��Miscellaneous
�
a.��This
  Agreement may only be amended by
  an instrument in writing signed by the parties to the Agreement; provided the
  Trust may amend the amounts of the Fee in accordance with Section 2 of this
  Agreement.��All notices and other communications to either party will
  be duly given if in writing to the other party.
�
b.��The
  Distributor may enter into other
  similar agreements for the provision of the services contemplated hereunder
  with
  any other person or persons without the Broker-Dealer�s consent.
�
c.��The
  invalidity or unenforceability of
  any term or provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability
  of
  any other term or provision hereof.��This Agreement shall be governed
  by and construed in accordance with the laws (other than the conflict of laws
  rules) of the State of Connecticut and shall bind and inure to the benefit
  of
  the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
�
IN
  WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this instrument to be executed

3.�����������In
  consideration for the Services to be provided by NFS to the Contract owners
  pursuant to this Agreement, the Distributor will calculate and pay, or cause
  one
  of its affiliates to pay, and NFS will be entitled to receive from the
  Distributor a fee (�Service Fee�) at an annualized rate equal to [X.XX] % of
  theaverage daily net assets of each Fund held by the Variable Accounts during
  the period in which they were earned.

4.�����������If
  in the good faith opinion of the Distributor or the Funds, based upon an opinion
  of counsel reasonably acceptable to NFS, it is determined the payments under
  this Agreement are, will be or may be in contravention or violation of any
  law,
  rule, regulation, court decision or order, out-of-court settlement of actual
  or
  threatened litigation or enforcement position of any regulatory body having
  jurisdiction over the Distributor or the Funds or their affiliates (taken
  together, �Change in Law�), the Service Fee shall be adjusted accordingly to
  conform to such Change in Law on terms and conditions deemed fair and equitable
  by the Distributor or the Funds, as the case may be.

5.�����������The
  Service Fee will be paid to NFS by electronic funds transfer as soon as
  practicable, but no later than 30 days after the end of the period in which
  they
  were earned.��If the assets held in the Variable Accounts are less
  than $1 billion as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, the Service Fees
  for the following year will be paid on a monthly basis.��The Service
  Fee payment will be accompanied or preceded by a statement showing the
  calculation of the amounts being paid by the Distributor for the relevant period
  and such other supporting data as may be reasonably requested by
  NFS.

6.�����������The
  Service Fee shall be paid either by (a) the Distributor or one of its affiliates
  from general operating funds, or (b) directly by the Funds pursuant to the
  shareholder service plan adopted by the Board of Directors of the
  Funds.

7.�����������The
  Service Fee shall be calculated as an annualized percentage ([X.XX%]) of the
  average aggregate amount invested in the Funds under the Contracts issued by
  the
  Variable Accounts for the applicable period.��The average aggregate
  amount shall be computed by totaling the aggregate investment (net asset value
  multiplied by total number of Fund shares held in the Variable Accounts) on
  each
  calendar day during the period and dividing by the total number of calendar
  days
  during the period.

8.�����������The
  effective date of this Agreement with regard to a Contract will be the later
  of
  November 3, 1997, or the launch date of each Contract.

9.�����������The
  parties agree that a Service Fee will be paid to NFS according to this Agreement
  with respect to each Fund as long as shares of such Fund are held by the
  Variable Accounts except in the event NFS terminates this Agreement, provided
  that payments will continue for six months after such termination based on
  shares of the Fund held by the Variable Accounts during that period, or payment
  is prohibited by a Change in Law.��This provision will survive the
  termination of this Agreement and the termination of the Distributor�s Fund
  Participation Agreements with Nationwide.

10.�����������NFS
  and Distributor agree that the Service Fees described in the Agreement are
  for
  administrative services only and do not constitute payment in any manner for
  investment advisory services or for the cost of distribution of the Funds or
  the
  Contracts.

11.�����������This
  Agreement may be terminated by NFS at any time upon written notice to the
  Distributor and by Distributor upon at least 30 days� written notice to
  NFS.��In addition, Distributor may terminate this Agreement
  immediately upon written notice to NFS (1) if required by any applicable law
  or
  regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Board of Directors/Trustees
  of a
  Fund, (3) if NFS engages in any material breach of this Agreement or (4) if
  Nationwide or any other NFS affiliate engages in conduct which would constitute
  a material breach of this Agreement were Nationwide or the affiliate a party
  to
  this Agreement.��This Agreement will terminate immediately and
  automatically with respect to Funds held in the Variable Accounts upon the
  termination of the Fund Participation Agreement which governs a Fund�s
  inclusions as an investment option in the Variable Account and in such event
  no
  notice is required under this Agreement.

Prospectus supplement dated January 13, 2015
to the following prospectus(es):
Nationwide Future Executive VUL prospectus dated May 1,
2014 


This
 supplement updates certain information contained in your prospectus. Please read it and keep it with your prospectus for future reference.  
On January 13, 2015, or the date of state approval (whichever
is later), policy owners will have the option of applying for a Long Term Care Rider.
The benefit associated with the Long-Term Care Rider is that,
upon the Insured meeting certain eligibility requirements, the policy owner is paid a monthly benefit to assist with the expenses associated with Qualified Long-Term Care Services, which include, but are not limited to, long-term care facility
stay(s), home health care services, and adult day care services. Benefit payments represent an advance of a portion of the Base Policy Specified Amount (Total Specified Amount if the Supplemental Insurance Rider is elected and In Force) which will
ultimately reduce the Cash Surrender Value and Death Benefit. A monthly Long-Term Care Rider charge is deducted from the Cash Value if this Rider is elected.
As a result, the following changes have been made to the
prospectus: 1. The second bullet point in the Coverage Flexibility subsection of the In Summary: Policy Benefits section is replaced with the following: 


•
 
increase or decrease the
Base Policy Specified Amount and/or the specified amount associated with elected Riders, if applicable;  
2. The following bullet point is added to the Riders subsection of the In Summary: Policy Benefits section: 


•
 
Long-Term Care Rider
  3. The second sentence in footnote 3
to the Periodic Charges table in the In Summary: Fee Tables section is deleted and the following sentence is added to the end of the footnote:
Different and separate charges will be
applied for any Rider Specified Amount under the Supplemental Insurance Rider and/or any Long-Term Care Specified Amount under the Long-Term Care Rider, see the Rider Charges table.
4. The following is added to the end of the Rider Charges table in the In Summary: Fee Tables section:

The maximum Long-Term Care
Rider Charge assumes: the Insured is a female; Issue Age 80; standard non-tobacco; and issued on a simplified issue basis. The minimum charge assumes: the Insured is a male; Issue Age 21; standard tobacco; and issued on a regular issue basis.
  5. The fourth bullet point in the Policy Owner Rights subsection of the Policy Owner and Beneficiaries subsection of The Policy section is replaced with the
following: 


•
 
changing insurance coverage
such as death benefit option changes, adding or removing Riders, and/or increasing or decreasing the Total Specified Amount and/or the specified amount associated with elected Riders, if applicable.   
 VLOB-0370-4 
  

 
6. The following is added to the end of the Increases subsection of the Changing the Amount of Insurance Coverage subsection of The Policy section:
Increases in the Base Policy Specified
Amount will result in a corresponding increase in the Long-Term Care Specified Amount only if the increase causes the Long-Term Care Specified Amount to fall below 10% of the Total Specified Amount.
7. The following is added to the end of the Decreases subsection of the Changing the Amount of Insurance Coverage subsection of The Policy section:
Decreases in the Base Policy Specified
Amount will result in a corresponding decrease in the Long-Term Care Specified Amount only if the Total Specified Amount would be less than the Long-Term Care Specified Amount after the decrease.
8. The third paragraph of the
Eligibility subsection of the Overloan Lapse Protection Rider subsection of the Policy Riders and Rider Charges section is replaced with the following:
Note: The
Long-Term Care Rider and the Change of Insured Rider will terminate or will need to be terminated by the policy owner prior to invoking the Overloan Lapse Protection Rider. An election to invoke the Overloan Lapse Protection Rider is
irrevocable. 9. The following subsection, entitled Long-Term Care Rider, is added to end of the Policy Riders and Rider Charges section:
Long-Term Care Rider
The benefit associated with the Long-Term
Care Rider is that, upon the Insured meeting certain eligibility requirements, the policy owner is paid a monthly benefit to assist with the expenses associated with Qualified Long-Term Care Services, which include, but are not limited to, long-term
care facility stay(s), home health care services, and adult day care services. Benefit payments represent an advance of a portion of the Base Policy Specified Amount (Total Specified Amount if the Supplemental Insurance Rider is elected and In
Force) which will ultimately reduce the Cash Surrender Value and Death Benefit. In addition, if the remaining Death Benefit is less than 10% of the initial Total Specified Amount when the Insured dies and the policy is In Force, a residual Death
Benefit of 10% of the initial Total Specified Amount minus any Indebtedness and partial surrenders will be paid. The Long-Term Care Rider has no Cash Surrender Value and no loan values.
The maximum monthly benefit, which is
determined by Nationwide at the time a request for benefits under the terms of the Rider is submitted, will be the lesser of:
1. 2% of Long-Term Care Specified Amount in
effect; 2. Two times the per diem
amount allowed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act times thirty (30); or
3. 1/12 of the maximum lifetime
benefit. The maximum lifetime benefit
under any combination of Qualified Long-Term Care Services is equal to the lesser of the Long-Term Care Specified Amount or the initial Total Specified Amount minus Indebtedness and partial surrenders.
A policy owner may request to receive a
monthly benefit less than the maximum subject to a minimum monthly benefit. Choosing a lesser amount could extend the length of the benefit period of the Long-Term Care Rider.
The Long-Term Care Specified Amount,
elected at issue, represents the maximum accumulation of long-term care benefits available under the Long-Term Care Rider. This amount must be at least 10% of the Base Policy Specified Amount (Total Specified Amount if the Supplemental Insurance
Rider is elected and In Force) and no more than the Total Specified Amount.
State regulation of long-term care benefits
will result in differences in this Rider's name, covered services, criteria for eligibility of benefit payment, cost of insurance charge factors, maximum and minimum monthly and lifetime benefit amounts, and availability of the 10% residual Death
Benefit. State variations are subject to change without notice at any time. Contact the Service Center to obtain a copy of the Long-Term Care Rider applicable to the policy.
Availability
Subject to Nationwide's underwriting
approval, the Long-Term Care Rider may be purchased at any time while the policy is In Force. If purchased after the Policy Date, Nationwide will require new evidence of insurability.   
 VLOB-0370-4 
  

 
Underwriting and approval of the Long-Term Care Rider is
separate and distinct from underwriting and approval of the policy and Supplemental Insurance Rider. Therefore, it is possible that the underwriting risk class for the Long-Term Care Rider could differ from the policy and Supplemental Insurance
Rider or that an applicant could qualify for the policy and Supplemental Insurance Rider and still be declined for the Long-Term Care Rider.
There is a free look period associated with
this Rider. Within 30 days of receipt of the Rider, the policy owner may return it to the sales representative who sold it, or to the Service Center. The Rider will be void and related charges will be refunded to the policy owner, see Right to Cancel (Examination Right). The Long-Term Care Rider is guaranteed renewable.
Invoking the Rider
To invoke this Rider, the Insured must be:
(1) severely cognitively impaired or (2) unable to do at least two of the following activities of daily living: bathing, continence, dressing, eating, using the toilet facilities, or transferring (moving into or out of bed, chair, or
wheelchair). In addition, a 90-day
waiting period, referred to as an "elimination period," must be satisfied before benefits are paid. Benefits will not be retrospectively paid for the elimination period. The elimination period can be satisfied by any combination of Qualified
Long-Term Care Services. These Qualified Long-Term Care Services need not be continuous, but must be accumulated within a continuous period of 730 days. The elimination period has to be satisfied only once while the Rider is in effect. The benefit
associated with the Rider may not cover all prospective long-term care costs. The benefits paid in association with the Rider are intended to be "qualified long-term care insurance" under federal tax law, and generally will not be taxable to the
policy owner, see Taxes. See a tax advisor about the use of this Rider.
Terminating the Rider
This Rider will terminate when the maximum
lifetime benefit under the Rider has been paid, the policy matures, the Insured dies, the Overloan Lapse Protection Rider is invoked, the Rider is terminated by written request to the Service Center, or the policy is terminated.
Even if the Rider is terminated, benefits
will still be payable if: (1) the Qualified Long-Term Care Services are received in a licensed facility; (2) eligibility for such benefits began while the Rider was in force; and (3) eligibility for such benefits continue without interruption after
termination of the Rider. Unless the Rider is reinstated, such extension of benefits may be limited to the duration of the benefit period or to payment of the maximum lifetime Long-Term Care Rider benefit amount and may be subject to all other
applicable provisions of the policy and Rider.
The Rider may be reinstated if the policy
lapses while the Insured would otherwise meet the criteria set forth in the Eligibility for the Payment of Benefits provision if the Insured provides a written request within five (5) months from the date of termination, and certain other conditions
are met, including payment sufficient to keep the policy and all attached riders In Force for a minimum of three (3) months.
Long-Term Care Rider Charge
A monthly Long-Term Care Rider charge is
deducted if this Rider is elected. The Long-Term Care Rider charge compensates Nationwide for providing long-term care benefits upon the Insured meeting certain eligibility requirements. The Rider charge is the product of the Long-Term Care
Specified Amount, a Long-Term Care Rider charge rate, and a factor based on the Long-Term Care Rider rate class multiple stated in the Policy Data Pages. The Long-Term Care Rider charge rate is based on Nationwide's expectations as to the Insured's
potential need for long-term care over time and will vary by the Insured's sex (if not unisex classified), Issue Age, rate class, rate type, and Long-Term Care Rider effective date.
The Long-Term Care Rider charge will be
deducted proportionally from the Sub-Accounts and fixed investment options allocations. Because the Long-Term Care Rider charge is deducted from the Cash Value, electing this Rider could reduce the amount of proceeds payable when the Death Benefit
depends on Cash Value. Additionally, any benefits paid pursuant to this Rider will reduce the Cash Surrender Value and Death Benefit.
Note: Upon
meeting the requirements for benefits under this Rider, the Long-Term Care Rider charge will be waived for the duration of the Rider benefit payment period; however, all other monthly deductions will continue to be charged. Additionally, loans or
partial surrenders will not be permitted while receiving benefits under the Rider. If the policy's Cash Value minus Indebtedness is insufficient to cover all other monthly deductions while benefits are being received under the Rider, the policy will
not lapse and monthly deductions will be waived while the Rider benefit is being paid. This includes monthly deductions for other In Force Riders. Premium requirements for any death benefit guarantee feature of the policy or any elected Rider are
not waived. Once the Insured is no longer receiving benefits  
VLOB-0370-4 
  

 
associated with the Long-Term Care Rider, additional
Premium may be necessary to prevent the policy from Lapsing. As a protection against unintentional lapse, the Rider provides the right to designate at least one other person as an authorized representative who will receive the notice of lapse or
termination of the policy for nonpayment of Premium, in addition to the policy owner.
Limitations
While receiving Rider benefits, the
following are not permitted: loans, partial Surrenders, Specified Amount changes, changes in underwriting classification, rider additions, or changes in death benefit option. Upon receiving Rider benefits, a long-term care benefit payout account
will be created and a monthly report will be provided to the policy owner.
The Rider does not cover any expense which
results from suicide, felonies, alcoholism or drug addiction, or war. Nor does the Rider cover expenses which result from preexisting conditions that are not disclosed in the application if the need for services begins during the first six months
after the Long Term Care Rider effective date.
Incontestability
Nationwide will not contest payment under
the Rider if the Rider has been In Force for less than six months unless the Insured makes a misrepresentation that is material to the acceptance of the Insured for coverage. Nationwide will not contest payment under the Rider if the Rider has been
In Force for at least six months, but less than two years, unless the Insured makes a misrepresentation that is both material to the acceptance of coverage and pertains to the condition for which benefits are sought. Nationwide will not contest
payment under the Rider after the Rider has been In Force for two years unless the Insured knowingly and intentionally misrepresented relevant facts relating to their health. A separate contestability period will apply for any increase of the
Long-Term Care Specified Amount that was subject to evidence of insurability.
Claims
Written notice of a claim must be given
within thirty (30) days after the Insured begins receiving Qualified Long-Term Care Services. Written proof of claim, consisting of detailed documentation that describes and confirms the Insured is chronically ill and is receiving Qualified
Long-Term Care Services, must be given within ninety (90) days. If Nationwide determines that a benefit trigger has not been met, it will follow internal and external review processes consistent with applicable laws and regulations in the State of
Issue. The policy owner must give immediate notice when the receipt of Qualified Long-Term Care Services has ceased or is no longer required. Nationwide, at its own expense, has the right to have the Insured examined as often as it may reasonably
require while the Insured is receiving Qualified Long-Term Care Services.
10. The following clause is added to the end of the second
sentence of the first paragraph of the Reinstatement subsection of the Lapse section:
and any reinstatement requirements
contained in the Riders. 11. The first sentence of the
second paragraph of the Calculation of the Death Benefit subsection of The Death Benefit section is deleted.
12. The first sentence of the first paragraph of the Suicide subsection of The Death Benefit section is replaced with the following:
If the Insured dies by suicide within two
years from the Policy Date, and, in some states, within two years of a reinstatement date, Nationwide will pay no more than the sum of the Premiums paid, less any Indebtedness, less any partial surrenders, and less the long-term care benefit payout
account if the Long-Term Care Rider is elected. 13. The
second paragraph of the Suicide subsection of the Death Benefit subsection of the The Policy section is replaced with the
following: If the Insured dies by
suicide, while sane or insane, within two years from the effective date of a change of Insured (pursuant to the terms of the Change of Insured Rider, if elected and invoked), Nationwide will pay no more than the Cash Value as of the Change Date,
plus any Premium paid since such date, less any Indebtedness, less any partial surrenders, and less the long-term care benefit payout account if the Long-Term Care Rider is elected.
14. The following bullet point is added to the end of the first
paragraph of the Extending Coverage Beyond the Maturity Date subsection of the Policy Maturity section: 


•
 
If applicable, the Long-Term
Care Rider will remain in effect.    
VLOB-0370-4 
  

 
15. The following subsection, titled Long-Term
Care Insurance, is added to the Taxes section following the Terminal Illness subsection:
Long-Term Care Insurance
A long-term care rider issued with a life
policy or one that is subsequently added to the policy is intended to meet the requirements of a qualified long-term care insurance contract under Section 7702B of the Internal Revenue Code. Payments made under the Long-Term Care Rider will
generally be excluded from income under the Code.
However, benefits paid under this Rider may
be taxable. For instance, if a benefit amount is elected that is greater than that allowed by the IRS per diem limitation, the portion that exceeds the allowable amount will be taxable. If any changes are necessary for the Rider to conform to
changes in the requirements of the Code, the policy owner will be given the right to accept or reject the changes. If the policy owner rejects the changes, the Rider may no longer be tax-qualified under the Code.
Payment of long-term care rider charges
will be made through deductions from the cash value of the life policy. These deductions from the cash value are considered to be distributions from the life policy for Federal tax purposes. The Federal tax treatment of such distributions are
governed by Section 72(e)(11) which provides that the deductions will reduce the investment in the contract and will not be included in income even if the policy owner has recovered all of their investment in the contract.
The payment of long-term care benefits made
to the policy owner of the long-term care rider will be reported on a Form 1099-LTC. In addition, deductions from the cash value of the life insurance policy to pay for long-term care rider charges during the calendar year will be reported on Form
1099-R. This discussion of the tax
treatment of the long-term care rider is not meant to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules, and because they are affected by the policy owner's facts and circumstances, the policy owner should consult with legal and tax counsel and
other competent advisors regarding these matters. 16. The
following definitions are added to Appendix B: Definitions:
Long-Term Care Specified Amount – The maximum accumulation of benefits available under the Long-Term Care Rider. This amount must be at least 10% of the Total Specified Amount and no more than 100% of the Total Specified Amount. This amount is
elected at the time the Rider is issued.
Qualified Long-Term Care Services – Services that meet the requirements of §7702(B)(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Such services are as follows: necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, curative, treatment,
mitigation and rehabilitative services, and maintenance or personal care services which are required by a chronically ill individual. These services are provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a licensed health care
practitioner.

Item 29. Indemnification
Provision is made in Nationwide's Amended and Restated Code of
Regulations and expressly authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant
will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. Item

Applicants' and Section 17(b) Applicants' Representations
1. NWL and NLAIC are stock life insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Ohio. NLAIC is wholly owned by NWL which is wholly owned by Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of Accounts II, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 and P-1 and VLI Accounts 2, 4, 7, and P-1. NLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of B, G, and P-A and VLI Account P-A.
2. All of the Separate Accounts are registered unit investment trusts used to issue one or more Contracts together with their respective Insurance Company. The file numbers for each Separate Account's registration under the Act and each Contract's registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“1933 Act”) are set forth in the Application.
3. NVIT is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type, and it securities are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File Nos. 811-03213 and 002-73024). Two of these series, the NVIT—American Century NVIT Multi-Cap Value Fund and NVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (each an “NVIT Fund”), are the replacement funds (“New Funds” or “New Portfolios”) in the proposed Substitutions.Start Printed Page 66807

4. Nationwide Fund Advisors (“NFA”) currently serves as investment adviser to each of the NVIT Funds. NFA employs a subadvisory structure as part of its advisory strategy with respect to the NVIT Funds. Through an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, NVIT is exempt from Section 15(a) of the Act and Rule 18f-2 thereunder with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”).[1] 

5. Applicants represent that the relief granted in the Manager of Managers Order extends to New Funds permitting NFA to enter into and materially amend investment subadvisory agreements without obtaining shareholder approval. Applicants indicate that the prospectuses for the New Funds disclose and explain the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order. They also represent that if a new Subadviser is retained for a Fund, Contract owners (“Contractowners”) would receive all information about the new Subadviser that would be included in a proxy statement, including any change in disclosure caused by the addition of a new Subadviser.
6. All of the Contracts involved in the Substitutions (i) permit transfers of contract value among the subaccounts pursuant to the limitations of the particular Contract, and (ii) are subject to market timing policies and procedures that may operate to limit transfers. Applicants represent that to the extent that the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or transfer fees on a Contractowner's right to transfer, such restrictions, limitations, and transfer fees will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions.
7. Each Contract's prospectus contains provisions reserving Insurance Company Applicants' right to substitute shares of one Investment Option for shares of another Investment Option already purchased or to be purchased in the future if: (i) Shares of a current underlying mutual fund are no longer available for investment by the Separate Account; or (ii) in the judgment of Insurance Company Applicants' management, further investment in such Investment Option is inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Contract. Each Insurance Company Applicant's management has determined that further investment in the New Funds is no longer appropriate in view of the purposes of the Contracts.
8. Applicants represent that all of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions are currently available as underlying investment options in the Contracts.
9. Each Insurance Company, on its behalf and on behalf of the Separate Accounts proposes to make certain substitutions of various classes of shares of 6 funds currently available under the Contracts (the “Old Funds” or “Old Portfolios”) for shares of the following classes of the corresponding NVIT New Funds:
No.Old fundOld classNVIT New fundNew class1American Century Variable Portfolios, Inc.—American Century VP Value Fund (“Old Value Fund”)Class INVIT—American Century NVIT Multi Cap Value Fund (“New Multi Cap Value Fund”)Class I2Old Value FundClass IINew Multi Cap Value FundClass II3Fidelity Variable Insurance Products (“VIP”) Fund—VIP Contrafund Portfolio (“Old Contrafund Portfolio”)Initial ClassNVIT—Oppenheimer NVIT Large Cap Growth Fund (“New Large Cap Growth Fund”)Class I4Old Contrafund PortfolioService ClassNew Large Cap Growth FundClass I5Old Contrafund PortfolioService Class 2New Large Cap Growth FundClass II6Fidelity VIP Fund—VIP Growth Opportunities Portfolio (“Old Growth Opps.

10. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions are part of each Insurance Company's overall business plan to make the Contracts more attractive to purchasers and more efficient to administer and oversee.
11. Applicants assert their belief that the Substitutions will: (i) Consolidate investment options resulting in a less confusing menu of investment options for investors, greater efficiency in administration of the Contracts and the capacity to add other types of investment options; (ii) make the investment decision process more manageable for the investor through consistent disclosure format and terminology making it easier for Contractowners to analyze fund information and make informed investment decisions relating to allocation of his or her Contract value; (iii) enable the Insurance Companies to reduce certain costs that they incur in administering the Contracts by removing overlapping investment options; (iv) lower administrative costs for the Insurance Companies which could result in resources being reallocated to providing other contractowner services and support, and an overall more efficient and customer-friendly product offering. (v) enable the Start Printed Page 66808Trust's sub-advised strategy and augment the Insurance Companies' goal of efficiently offering a continuously competitive menu of investment options to its existing and prospective contractowners; (vi) provide investors with a more favorable and less confusing overall investment experience; and (vii) reduce the number and potential for variation of trading policies that contractowners must navigate and understand.
12. Applicants submit that each Substitution provides an alternate investment option that has the same or lower net operating expenses as the Old Fund. The applicable management fees, 12b-1 fees, other expenses, contractual waiver or reimbursement values and total operating expenses for each Old and New Fund are presented in detail in the Application and summarized below:

The following summarizes the more complete comparison of New and Old Funds provided in the Application.
13. Substitutions #1 & #2: Old Value Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Value Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Specifically, Applicants state that both “seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and secondarily income * * * [and] seek to meet their objectives by investing in equity securities, using a value investment strategy that looks for companies that are undervalued or are temporarily out of favor in the market.” Both funds allow for the use of derivatives securities, preferred stock, convertible and foreign securities without limitation. Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
14. Substitutions #3-#5: Old Contrafund Portfolio Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both the Old Contrafund Portfolio and the New Large Cap Growth Fund “have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth or appreciation, and both invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks. Both funds diversify among a variety of industries and sectors.” Applicants acknowledge that differences in the funds' risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but assert the belief that these differences are immaterial and do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks than before the Substitution.
15. Substitutions #6-#8: Old Growth Opps. Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that both Old Growth Opps. Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital growth, investing primarily in common stocks. Both funds employ a growth style of investing, seeking companies with above-average growth potential or whose earnings are expected to grow consistently faster than those of other companies. Applicants also note that New Large Cap Growth Fund has a diversification policy affirmatively seeking to limit risk which Old Growth Opps. Fund does not share. Applicants assert that both funds have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Applicants state that while the funds' investment objectives are not identical, any distinction between them is immaterial, since both funds are intended for long-term investment and represent that any differences in their investment objectives do not introduce Contract Owners to greater risks than before the Substitution.
16. Substitutions #9 & #10: Old Cap Appreciation Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants represent that Old Cap Appreciation Fund and Start Printed Page 66809New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks, seek capital growth or appreciation by investing in common stocks using a growth style investment strategy, diversify broadly among companies and industries, and invest in a similar percentage of foreign securities. Applicants state that both funds look for companies in businesses that have above-average growth potential, growth rates the portfolio manager believes are sustainable over time, and stocks with reasonable valuations relative to their growth potential. Applicants represent that immaterial differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies exist but do not expose Contractowners to materially greater risks post-Substitution.
17. Substitutions #11 & #12: Old Blue Chip Fund Verses New Large Cap Growth Fund. Applicants believe Old Blue Chip Fund and New Large Cap Growth Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek long-term capital growth and invest at least 80% of their net assets in stocks of established companies using a growth style of investing. Applicants believe that the differences in risks, investment objectives and strategies are immaterial, and the risks to Contractowners will not be materially greater after the Substitutions.
18. Substitutions #13 & #14: Old Equity Income Fund Verses New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants state their belief that Old Equity Income Fund and New Multi Cap Value Fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks. Both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income, although seeking current income is a secondary objective of New Multi Cap Value Fund. Applicants represent that both funds invest at least 80% of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size, employing a value style of investing, and allow foreign securities, preferred stocks, convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies. Applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist, but believe these differences do not introduce Contractowners to materially greater risks after the Substitutions.
19. Substitution Procedure: In-Kind Transactions. Applicants assert that as of the effective date of the Substitutions (“Substitution Date”), a portion of the securities of the Old Funds will be redeemed in-kind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the New Funds. Applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. They further represent that all redemptions of shares of the Old Portfolios and purchases of shares of the New Portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the Substitution Date in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contractowner's Contract value, cash value, death benefit, or dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts.
20. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that: (i) The New Fund shares sold in-kind will be of the type and quality that a New Fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash; and (ii) NFA and the relevant subadviser(s) will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant New Fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction.
Whether NFA or relevant Subadviser of a New Fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio security in-kind, Applicants represent that each Substitution will be effected by redeeming shares of the Existing Fund in cash and/or in-kind on the Substitution Date and using the proceeds of those redemptions to purchase shares of the New Fund at their net asset value on the same date.
21. Substitution Costs and Fund Expenses. Applicants state that the Insurance Companies have agreed to bear all expenses incurred in connection with the Substitutions and related filings and notices, including legal, accounting, brokerage, and other fees and expenses. In addition, Applicants assert that Contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the Substitutions as prior to the Substitutions.
22. With respect to those who are Contractowners on the Substitution Date, Applicants specifically represent the following: On the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four (24) months following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will reimburse those Contractowners with Contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an New Fund to the extent that, for that period, the New Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Old Fund's net operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and subaccount expenses (asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from sub-account assets and reflected in the calculation of sub-account unit values) for fiscal year 2009.
23. Contract Charges and Benefits. Applicants represent that the Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date. To the extent the Contracts contain restrictions, limitations or fees for transfers, Applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed Substitutions, and each Substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the Contracts. Applicants state that Contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the Insurance Companies' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. Applicants also affirm that the Substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to Contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the Contracts.
24. Manager of Managers Order. Applicants further represent that, after the Substitution Date, the New Funds will not change a Subadviser, add a new Subadviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in Subadviser, the new Subadviser, or the Fund's ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on Manager of Managers Order. In addition, before the Substitutions, Applicants state that each Contractowner will have been provided with a New Portfolio prospectus describing the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.
25. Notice Procedures. Applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the Contracts will be delivered to Contractowners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date. Applicants state that the supplement (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) will: (i) Notify all Contractowners of the Insurance Company's intent to implement the Substitutions, that this Amended Application has been filed to obtain the Start Printed Page 66810necessary orders to do so, and indicate the anticipated Substitution Date; (ii) advise Contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the Substitution Date, Contractowners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Old Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the Contract; (iii) instruct Contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed Substitutions; (iv) advise Contractowners that any Contract value remaining in an Old Fund sub-account on the Substitution Date will be transferred to the corresponding New Fund sub-account, and that the Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge; (v) inform Contractowners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Substitution Date, the Insurance Companies will permit Contractowners to make transfers of Contract value out of each New Fund sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the Contract; and (vi) inform Contractowners that, except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus, the respective Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a New Fund for at least thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date.
26. Applicants also represent that: (i) Prior to the Substitutions; all existing Contractowners will have received the appropriate prospectus supplements containing this disclosure and the most recent prospectus and/or supplement for the New Portfolios (ii) new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement, contract prospectus, and the prospectus and/or supplement for the New Funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements; and (iii) prospective Contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the Contract prospectus. Applicants also represent that, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the Substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the Act approving the Substitutions.
2. Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission approves the substitution. The Commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
3. Applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the Contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related Contracts. Applicants declare that, in all material respects, each New Fund and its corresponding Old Fund have similar, substantially similar, or identical investment objectives and strategies, and that each proposed Substitutions retains for Contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the Contracts. They assert that after the Substitution Date, Contractowners invested in a New Fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratio(s) as before the Substitution. Further, Applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected Contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a Substitution for a period of twenty four (24) months after the Substitution.
4. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and assert that replacement of the Old Portfolios with the New Portfolios is consistent with the protection of Contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Specifically, they argue that the Substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Rather, Applicants conclude that “[a]ny impact on the investment programs of affected Contractowners should be negligible,” and affirm the Substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts including the annuity, life, or tax benefits they afford affected Contractowners.
5. Section 17(b) Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the in-kind Substitution transactions (“In-Kind Transactions”).
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principal, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company. Pursuant to Section 17(a)(1) of the Act, the Section 17(b) Applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the Substitutions. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of In-Kind Transactions, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates.
7. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that: the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the Act; and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
8. Based on the facts presented above, Section 17(b) Applicants submit that the terms of the In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid and received, are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching because: (i) The Contractowners' Contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted; and (ii) Section 17(b) Applicants agree to carry out the In-Kind Transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of Rule 17a-7 and the procedures adopted thereunder, except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash. Thus, Section 17(b) Applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the In-Kind Transactions.
9. In support of this position Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio Start Printed Page 66811securities as specified in Rule 17a-7(b) and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the Substitution Date. In accordance with Rule 17a-7(c), Section 17(b) Applicants assert that the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the In-Kind Transactions, as recited in the relevant registered investment company's registration statement and reports. As specified in Rule 17a-7(d), the Application states that no brokerage commission, fee (except for any customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed In-Kind Transactions. Likewise, Section 17(b) Applicants represent that Trust's Board of Trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by Rule 17a-7(e) and (f). The Application also states, “pursuant to Rule 17a-7(e)(3), during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any In-Kind Transactions occur, the Trust's Board of Trustees will review reports submitted by NFA in respect of such In-Kind Transactions in order to determine that all such In-Kind Transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein.” Finally, Applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed In-Kind Transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with Rule 17a-7(g).
Conclusions
Section 26 Applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed Substitutions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of approval pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed In-Kind Transactions meet the standards of Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act and request that the Commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act.

	2. The

	Legal Proceedings

	section of your prospectus is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:


	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.
