I am on a fixed income. I have been working on my credit, so I know that I need a car and I need to start my own business. I am a leader and serious about my finances.

I need a small personal loan I own my own house and it is paid for butt I am in the middle of fighting with disability I was diagnosed almost four years ago with MS. I need a small loan for $6,000 so I can pay my back taxes. Or at the end of August they're going to take me home and like I said it is paid for they're going to take it for $6,200. Is there anyway I can use my home as collateral and make small payments so I don't lose my home… read more

Get a small personal loan what you're asking for your payment to be about $170 to $180 a month

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
