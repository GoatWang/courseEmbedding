betaworks
Betaworks is a start-up platform based in New York. We focus on the intersection of media and technology. Our platform combines three areas of expertise. 
A studio where we build products like GIPHY, Dots, bitly and Tweetdeck.
An investment fund for early stage start-ups related to the areas we are building in. Previous investments include: Tumblr, Kickstarter, Medium and Gimlet.
And camp; a thematic accelerator program for start-ups in frontier technology such as Bots, AI and Verbal Computing.
We work to bring together these three areas to create extraordinary companies and work with exceptional people combining art and science.

Studio

We have built products for the social web since 2007. Recent successes include GIPHY; the search engine for gifs, Dots; the beautiful mobile gaming franchise and Poncho; the popular weatherbot.
Some of our earlier studio products included Bitly, Chartbeat, and Tweetdeck, which was sold to Twitter. In 2012 we also acquired and relaunched Digg and Instapaper, which was sold to Pinterest in 2016.
Our current focus is in conversational interfaces; in other words, bots, verbal computing and AI. In the summer of 2016 we launched and raised money for Dexter, an elegant platform for building bots for brands and services.

















Fund

We make seed and early stage investments in great people and companies at the intersection of media and technology.  We look for companies that fit our thesis and will make our network stronger.
Typically our seed investments are $250k and we are among the first to invest. For example, we were one of the earliest investors in Tumblr, Kickstarter, and Tweetdeck. More recent investments include Product Hunt, Medium, Howdy, Slash Keyboard and Gimlet Media. We have made a number of investments in the Bot and Chat space through our first accelerator camp: Botcamp.
As the name betaworks suggests, we like betas. If you have something great we’d love to speak with you. Contact the fund team here.











Camp
Based on the success of our first accelerator program, botcamp, in the summer of 2016, we continue to run thematic pre-seed investment programs.
Camp at betaworks is an 11-week long program to help entrepreneurs build companies in specific areas of focus and investment for betaworks. During these programs, entrepreneurs have access to relevant industry leaders and betaworks teams, to assist with general company-building needs and topics specific to each camp’s theme (e.g. messaging, AI, NLP, etc.). Each camp company receives pre-seed financing of $200k.
Our second betacamp is voicecamp, focusing on conversational software that interacts with users in a way that is increasingly similar to how humans interact with each other: with our voices.

Betaworks Talks   |  Join OpenBeta   |  Follow @betaworks  |  Add to Digg Reader30 JanDigg By The Numbers, 2015 EditionAn Exercise In Dig(g)ital Corporate NudityAt the start of a new year, it’s tech company tradition/neurosis to do a swan dive into the previous year’s data in search of sunken treasures — patterns or insights that escaped notice in the daily rush of site metrics and KPI reports. I’ve been doing that over the past week, and thought it might be interesting to lift Digg’s hood and show some of our internal numbers from 2014. TL;DR: Digg had a terrific year, accelerating as the months progressed. Read full post .. See Digg on tumblr …  30 OctAlphaworkingI’m excited to announce that Erin Glenn has joined Alphaworks, the equity crowd funding platform we launched earlier this year, as CEO. Erin’s background is ideally suited to lead at Alphaworks.  For the past four years she has been CFO of a fast growing tech start-up where she helped scale the company from 10 to 500+ employees and nine digit revenues, prior to that she worked in investment banking with UBS and Morgan Stanley.  In those roles she has done private and public company capital raises — she knows what it is to raise money for a company. And she is passionately interested in enabling users to become owners — which is the core mission of Alphaworks.  As of last week she landed in New York, relocating from CA, and has started to get to work with the team.    We are also announcing that Vayner/RSE, CrunchFund, BoxGroup and White Star Capital are joining SVA and LHV as founding sponsors on the Alphaworks platform. Gary Vaynerchuk lays it out: “We’re big believers in Alphaworks and their approach to crowdfunding, enabling a company’s community to become owners.  By bringing our investments to the platform, individuals can invest along with us and together we can build more successful businesses.” 29 OctBetaworkers’ favorite under-the-radar horror flicksJust in time for Halloween: enjoy this list of our favorite underrated, off-the-grid, indie horror movies. We asked everyone for *one* movie and some people felt too strongly to choose, so we will respect their wishes.Alex (Bloglovin’): MAlex (Poncho): Suspiria, Wait Until Dark, The Brood, Near Dark, Blood and Black Lace, Alice Sweet Alice, aaaaand Ginger SnapsAnnalise (Poncho): Black SheepBryan (Digg): PontypoolChristian (Blend): AlienDom (Betaworks): Deep RedEric (Dots): Joy RideJess (Giphy): The Descent, In Fear, American Mary, Detention, As Above So Below, The Conjuring, Drag Me to HellJoe (Digg): TeethJon (Betaworks): Ice Cream ManKuan (Poncho): 僵尸叔叔。僵尸 (means hopping corpse which is equivalent to vampires in the US)Lauren (Betaworks): American GothicMaya (Betaworks): Stake Land, From Dusk Til Dawn, Hausu, The Woman (note there is zero chance you will like this movie but it is my favorite one)Sam (Betaworks): TremorsSissi (Digg): Hocus PocusSuman (Betaworks): The Shining, The Others 25 SepBuilding a better and more diverse communityWe’re huge fans of Hacker School, the retreat for developers who want to improve their skills and level up their careers. We’ve hired 8 (!) betaworks engineers out of their program, so we are firm believers in their ability to get amazing results - but they’re thinking much bigger than that.Since 2012, Hacker School and Etsy have partnered up to offer a needs-based grant program for women, to help improve gender equality in their community. (Since Hacker School is free, these grants go towards living expenses for the duration of the program.) So far, it’s been a huge success - Hacker School’s community has gone from 5% women to 35%.Now, in an effort to expand this grant program and further improve diversity at Hacker School (and, ultimately, in the tech community in general), these grants are also available to people who identify as black, non-white Hispanic, Native American, and Pacific Islander. We’re thrilled to be a contributor, and to help Hacker School with their mission.Hacker School has a lot of other great initiatives to help work towards equality; you can read more in their full announcement. If you’re a developer looking to focus on building your skills and advancing your career, we can’t recommend their program any more highly. And if you’re passionate about improving equality in tech and would like to discuss further possible initiatives, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Nick, one of the cofounders of Hacker School, or with Maya, betaworks’ head of community development. 8 SepBlend Launches Support For Propellerhead’s Reason With Artists Paul Wilson, Justen Williams, & Chris Freeman blendhq:Blend is thrilled to announce support for Propellerhead’s Reason music production software. Reason users now have access to the premiere platform for music collaboration, allowing sharing of in-progress music projects, tutorials, and sample packs.(Source: blendhq, via blendhq) 4 SepWhy Does My Hair Always Frizz, No Matter What I Do?Learn about the science of weather, from Poncho!hiponcho: Read More(via ) 3 SepNew Today: Digg Deeper Goes Deeperrethinkdigg:Last month we launched Digg Deeper, a useful feature that automagically identifies the most rapidly trending stories and videos among the people you follow on Twitter.Today, we’re excited to launch a set of new and awesome elements to Digg Deeper…(Source: rethinkdigg) 14 AugJust Launched– Giphy IFTTT Channel! We’re happy to announce that Giphy have just launched their very own IFTTT channel!

Check them out.You can read more about this partnership at the IFTTT blog here, and at the Giphy blog here. 5 AugPoncho Update: now available in NJ! (PLUS: new Hair Alert feature) Poncho has arrived in New Jersey! While he’s sunning himself somewhere down the Shore, you, friendly New Jerseyan, can now stay up to date about the weather in the cutest/most convenient way from your choice of internet-enabled device. That means Poncho can now be used in all of NY, NJ, and MA. Whew!Additionally, they’ve rolled out their new Hair Alert system which you can opt-in to in your Settings menu. Based on a top secret formula, you’ll get a message telling you whether or not to break out that New Jersey Devils cap to protect you from the wind/humidity.(Source: blog.poncho.is) 1 AugAll Yoking AsideI attended the Yo hackathon in NYC last weekend. I’ve written a bit about some theoretical reasons Yo could be interesting in the future, but it was great to see the wide variety of apps and especially how quickly the hackers built them.The winner was YoAuth and it was one of four security apps. Several leveraged the notion of two factor authentication, specifically that access to your phone (and requisite thumbprint/pass code security) means that if you have a phone with your Yo account on it, you’re probably you.YoAuth lets websites set up a login process where users register their Yo name with the site and can then “yo us to log in”. The surprising experience is that without touching the computer, the screen automatically changes to being logged in when you tap Yo on your phone.Some other authentication hacks let people grant and revoke access to their applications using Yo names.In their current versions, these are probably not quite fully secure but they provide a sign of what can be done on the platform.Beyond authentication, another interesting app was YOCITIBIKE, which lets you Yo the citibike rack nearest to your home and work and get a Yo back if there are more than 3 open racks to park. It’s useful because when you’re stopped at a light on a bike, you want the fewest clicks to the information.You can check out the complete list of hacks on HackerBracket. It’s worth noting that the hackathon was only three hours long. Without the Yo API, these developers would have had to build full-fledged iOS apps, which would have taken far longer.Looking forward to seeing what else gets built over time.-Matt

Betaworks is an American startup studio and seed stage venture capital company based in New York City[1][2][3][4] that invests in network-focused, consumer-facing[vague] media businesses.
Its hybrid investor/builder model has led to both investments in fast-growing startups like Tumblr, Airbnb, Groupon and Twitter as well as more exclusive stakes in internally built startups such as Chartbeat, Bitly and SocialFlow. Betaworks was founded in 2007 by John Borthwick and Andy Weissman.[5]
It has also recently come into the limelight a little more with The Intern podcast, hosted and produced by Allison Behringer. The podcast recounts a young woman beginning her career in the world of technology.[6]
Recently Betaworks was in the news for selling one of its products, called Instapaper to the social media scrapbooking site, Pinterest.[7]
Studio[edit]
Current:

Giphy lets anyone search for animated gifs on the web. It was born out of an experiment by two hackers in residence, Alex Chung and Jace Cooke, who found it difficult to browse the best gifs on the web. It spread unexpectedly quickly, serving millions of results in the first few weeks. "We could tell it struck a nerve, so we swarmed it," said Paul Murphy, the head of product at Betaworks told The Verge [8]
Bloglovin' helps people discover and follow their favorite blogs. The site was founded in Sweden and has over 2 million members, 70% of them who follow fashion blogs & over 90% who are female. Shortly after it took $1 million of investment from Betaworks and Lerer Hippeau Ventures in 2012, traffic spiked following Google's announcement to discontinue Google Reader.[9]
In July 2012, the company acquired the Digg brand and internet assets for USD $500,000[10][11] and merged it with News.me, a social news reading app.
In April 2013, the company acquired a majority stake in Instapaper, before selling it to Pinterest in 2016.[12]
In April 2013, the company released Dots, a video game downloaded over 10 million times.

Former:

Chartbeat, which provides realtime analytics to websites and blogs. It shows visitors, load times, and referring.
Bitly, which that allows users to shorten, share, and track links (URLs). Reducing the URL length makes sharing easier.
SocialFlow, which optimizes the real-time value of content.

deal with it



Six weeks ago, Jace Cooke and Alex Chung, two of the hackers in residence at New York innovation lab Betaworks, shared a fun little product they had cobbled together with about twenty friends. It was called Giphy, and it lets users search a database of around thousands of GIFs, the animated loops that have become the lingua franca of internet culture. Word spread like wildfire and by the end of that week, with no marketing at all, over 50,000 people had taken Giphy for a spin, melting down the not-yet-a-startup's one server on several occasions.
"We could tell it struck a nerve, so we swarmed it," said Paul Murphy, the head of product at Betaworks, which is home to startups such Chartbeat, Bitly and the newly refreshed Digg. "That's one of the incredible things about Betaworks, you can just kind of print up a team on demand." The team grew to half a dozen developers, designers and community managers.  In the weeks since the launch, over half a million users have searched for millions of GIFs.
At first, Giphy was just pulling its images from a few GIF goldmines like Tumblr and KnowYourMeme, but the index has been doubling in size every week since launch. The team were preparing a big launch to officially announce the connection to Betaworks and the their ambition to build the best GIF search and community platform. Then, BOOM, Google jumped into the game.
 
 

 
Yesterday afternoon, in a small, rather unceremonious post on Google+, the search giant announced that it was adding a drop-down option to the search tools menu on all its image searches. Users would now be able to perform an image search for an exploding robot, then filter those results so that only the animated images appear. The internet went wild with applause.
A great thing about Betaworks: you can print a team on demand
The team at Giphy has decided not to pack up shop. If anything, Google's move into GIF search just weeks after their arrival was sign that they were onto something truly massive, and perhaps tech titans were taking notice. The strategy going forward is to make Giphy about a lot more than search. "We obviously can't compete with Google in terms of crawling the entire web multiple times a day or layering on advanced image recognition algorithms," said Cooke. "But we think GIFs are more than just data points. They are a medium for expression. So we're going to build Giphy into the best place to search, curate, create, remix, and share GIFs."
Right now, Giphy hasn't launched tools to let users create and remix GIFs. But the basic experience is still very satisfying. On its homepage, Giphy displays a simple search bar at the top, then a collection of popular, trending, and handpicked hashtags organized around trending GIFs. Users can search for anything they want, or click through the collections of classics like #dealwithit, #foreveralone, #ryangosling, #kateupton, and of course, #cats. "We actually discovered there was an interesting real time element," said Cooke. "It's really useful when you are looking for the best GIF to capture a moment like Marco Rubio's dry mouth, Jessica Lawrence stumble at the Oscars, or the meteor exploding over Russia."
 
 

 
While Giphy is great at capturing and presenting trending topics, at this point Google's search results are far superior. Giphy can find you more than a thousand GIFs of Jennifer Lawrence, for instance, but returns zero results for a more refined search like for "Jennifer Lawrence trips Oscars."
"The initial goal in building giphy was to make a fun discovery tool." says Cooke. "Over the next week, we're turning on and tweaking a major search improvement, allowing you to search across multiple keywords and get stronger related results like you would with traditional search."
When you do get search results, Giphy has one major advantage over Google. You can mouse over a GIF in the search results and it will autoplay, allowing you to easily browse through a bunch of images without having to click through to each one. When you do click through to a GIF, the service gives you three options for your embed code tiled, normal, and fullscreen. Users can also share search results out to Facebook and Twitter. "It creates this viral loop," says Cooke. "Find a GIF, share a GIF, click a link, find a GIF, share a GIF..."

A tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, products and data brought together in imaginative ways to build out a more connected world. At first glance we seem to do many things. But first and foremost, we're builders, seeking to create a more sustainable innovation model. The more we build, the more we learn, the more we get ideas for peripheral things, all related, connected -- in a loosely coupled network of products and companies.   
betaworks is structured as a company-- a single company that owns larger pieces of the things it has built and smaller pieces of the things it has invested in. It operates as a network: a tightly linked network of ideas, people, capital, and data united to build out a more inspired and useful connected world.  betaworks makes seed-stage investments in this ecosystem. To us, seed investing means "first money in." Our typical investment size is $150,000-200,000. We always invest as part of a syndicate of angels and early stage VCs.   Our requirements from an investment perspective are simple, though narrow. Investments must be early stage, heavily tech focused, and have a working (public or private) prototype. We are a powerpoint-free zone.
We build and work closely with companies that we view as core to our vision, examples include: Summize/Twitter Search,  bitly,  TweetDeck, Chartbeat.   And more recently, Digg,  Dots,  Giphy and Instapaper, which betaworks acquired in April of 2013.   We attract the kind of people who could start their own company, but they don't necessarily want to run a company. They'd rather be the co-founder of eight things than tied down for years as the sole founder of one.  They'd rather build.

After An Approach From Facebook, Giphy Raises $17M At An $80M Valuation

Video Review: BMW i8 Hybrid Supercar












Giphy — the betaworks-backed platform for searching and sharing gifs — has just raised $17 million in Series B funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from General Catalyst and previous investors such as Lerer-Hippeau, betaworks, RRE Ventures, and CAA Ventures. A chunk of the round, $225k, is being raised through the Alphaworks equity crowdfunding platform. 
The investment values Giphy at $80 million, and TechCrunch sources say that the Giphy team originally started shopping for the round in October, but got distracted by potential acquisition talks from Facebook. In the end, Giphy chose to continue pursuing partnerships with various social media companies and focus on the financing. 
The financing will go toward growth, specifically hiring out more engineers and building out products, API partnerships, distribution partnerships, and the general user base. At this point in time, Giphy has no plans for revenue (at least not any that they’ll share with me). 
“We have a pretty big product roadmap planned for 2015,” said COO Adam Leibsohn. “There is lots of really cool stuff coming out, like some incredible gif-making tools. We’ve learned a lot over the last year about what we need and what gif lovers need, so we’re building against that knowledge base.” 
Put simply, Giphy is a search engine for gifs. The company tags gifs to certain categories or with various keywords to make finding the perfect gif that much easier. 
And beyond that, Giphy ensures that artists are credited for their works and offers distribution tools to help spread the word. For example, Giphy launched a link shortener that automatically embeds a clickable gif into tweets instead of taking up characters with the gif link and the intended hyperlink. 
The company launched out of betaworks in the same class as Dots and Poncho in April 2013, and has since gone on to raise a $2.5 million Series A alongside this recent $17 million Series B.
“Time and time again we’ve seen in the world of startups that if a product is defined in a single vertical that people associate the product with that vertical,” said John Borthwick, managing partner at betaworks. “Google has a gif search thing somewhere, but it’s one of two bazillion features on Google. The advantage that Giphy and other vertical platforms have is that people come thinking, ‘I want gifs.’ They’re thinking of media type first.” 
The team, which started with about six people and has grown to 16, still works out of the betaworks office in NY, but Leibsohn says they’re currently looking for office space. 
“The biggest challenge to us right now is… We want everyone to know, love and use gifs,” said Leibsohn. “There’s a lot to unpack in there, plenty of which is challenging. The easiest way to put the challenges ahead of Giphy is that I want my mom to use gifs. Everyday.”

betaworks
Betaworks is a start-up platform based in New York. We focus on the intersection of media and technology. Our platform combines three areas of expertise. 
A studio where we build products like GIPHY, Dots, bitly and Tweetdeck.
An investment fund for early stage start-ups related to the areas we are building in. Previous investments include: Tumblr, Kickstarter, Medium and Gimlet.
And camp; a thematic accelerator program for start-ups in frontier technology such as Bots, AI and Verbal Computing.
We work to bring together these three areas to create extraordinary companies and work with exceptional people combining art and science.






Scroll for more











Studio

We have built products for the social web since 2007. Recent successes include GIPHY; the search engine for gifs, Dots; the beautiful mobile gaming franchise and Poncho; the popular weatherbot.
Some of our earlier studio products included Bitly, Chartbeat, and Tweetdeck, which was sold to Twitter. In 2012 we also acquired and relaunched Digg and Instapaper, which was sold to Pinterest in 2016.
Our current focus is in conversational interfaces; in other words, bots, verbal computing and AI. In the summer of 2016 we launched and raised money for Dexter, an elegant platform for building bots for brands and services.

















Fund

We make seed and early stage investments in great people and companies at the intersection of media and technology.  We look for companies that fit our thesis and will make our network stronger.
Typically our seed investments are $250k and we are among the first to invest. For example, we were one of the earliest investors in Tumblr, Kickstarter, and Tweetdeck. More recent investments include Product Hunt, Medium, Howdy, Slash Keyboard and Gimlet Media. We have made a number of investments in the Bot and Chat space through our first accelerator camp: Botcamp.
As the name betaworks suggests, we like betas. If you have something great we’d love to speak with you. Contact the fund team here.











Camp
Based on the success of our first accelerator program, botcamp, in the summer of 2016, we continue to run thematic pre-seed investment programs.
Camp at betaworks is an 11-week long program to help entrepreneurs build companies in specific areas of focus and investment for betaworks. During these programs, entrepreneurs have access to relevant industry leaders and betaworks teams, to assist with general company-building needs and topics specific to each camp’s theme (e.g. messaging, AI, NLP, etc.). Each camp company receives pre-seed financing of $200k.
Our second betacamp is voicecamp, focusing on conversational software that interacts with users in a way that is increasingly similar to how humans interact with each other: with our voices.

Betaworks is an American startup studio and seed stage venture capital company based in New York City[1][2][3][4] that invests in network-focused, consumer-facing[vague] media businesses.
Its hybrid investor/builder model has led to both investments in fast-growing startups like Tumblr, Airbnb, Groupon and Twitter as well as more exclusive stakes in internally built startups such as Chartbeat, Bitly and SocialFlow. Betaworks was founded in 2007 by John Borthwick and Andy Weissman.[5]
It has also recently come into the limelight a little more with The Intern podcast, hosted and produced by Allison Behringer. The podcast recounts a young woman beginning her career in the world of technology.[6]
Recently Betaworks was in the news for selling one of its products, called Instapaper to the social media scrapbooking site, Pinterest.[7]
Studio[edit]
Current:

Giphy lets anyone search for animated gifs on the web. It was born out of an experiment by two hackers in residence, Alex Chung and Jace Cooke, who found it difficult to browse the best gifs on the web. It spread unexpectedly quickly, serving millions of results in the first few weeks. "We could tell it struck a nerve, so we swarmed it," said Paul Murphy, the head of product at Betaworks told The Verge [8]
Bloglovin' helps people discover and follow their favorite blogs. The site was founded in Sweden and has over 2 million members, 70% of them who follow fashion blogs & over 90% who are female. Shortly after it took $1 million of investment from Betaworks and Lerer Hippeau Ventures in 2012, traffic spiked following Google's announcement to discontinue Google Reader.[9]
In July 2012, the company acquired the Digg brand and internet assets for USD $500,000[10][11] and merged it with News.me, a social news reading app.
In April 2013, the company acquired a majority stake in Instapaper, before selling it to Pinterest in 2016.[12]
In April 2013, the company released Dots, a video game downloaded over 10 million times.

Former:

Chartbeat, which provides realtime analytics to websites and blogs. It shows visitors, load times, and referring.
Bitly, which that allows users to shorten, share, and track links (URLs). Reducing the URL length makes sharing easier.
SocialFlow, which optimizes the real-time value of content.

betaworks
Betaworks is a start-up platform based in New York. We focus on the intersection of media and technology. Our platform combines three areas of expertise. 
A studio where we build products like GIPHY, Dots, bitly and Tweetdeck.
An investment fund for early stage start-ups related to the areas we are building in. Previous investments include: Tumblr, Kickstarter, Medium and Gimlet.
And camp; a thematic accelerator program for start-ups in frontier technology such as Bots, AI and Verbal Computing.
We work to bring together these three areas to create extraordinary companies and work with exceptional people combining art and science.






Scroll for more











Studio

We have built products for the social web since 2007. Recent successes include GIPHY; the search engine for gifs, Dots; the beautiful mobile gaming franchise and Poncho; the popular weatherbot.
Some of our earlier studio products included Bitly, Chartbeat, and Tweetdeck, which was sold to Twitter. In 2012 we also acquired and relaunched Digg and Instapaper, which was sold to Pinterest in 2016.
Our current focus is in conversational interfaces; in other words, bots, verbal computing and AI. In the summer of 2016 we launched and raised money for Dexter, an elegant platform for building bots for brands and services.

















Fund

We make seed and early stage investments in great people and companies at the intersection of media and technology.  We look for companies that fit our thesis and will make our network stronger.
Typically our seed investments are $250k and we are among the first to invest. For example, we were one of the earliest investors in Tumblr, Kickstarter, and Tweetdeck. More recent investments include Product Hunt, Medium, Howdy, Slash Keyboard and Gimlet Media. We have made a number of investments in the Bot and Chat space through our first accelerator camp: Botcamp.
As the name betaworks suggests, we like betas. If you have something great we’d love to speak with you. Contact the fund team here.











Camp
Based on the success of our first accelerator program, botcamp, in the summer of 2016, we continue to run thematic pre-seed investment programs.
Camp at betaworks is an 11-week long program to help entrepreneurs build companies in specific areas of focus and investment for betaworks. During these programs, entrepreneurs have access to relevant industry leaders and betaworks teams, to assist with general company-building needs and topics specific to each camp’s theme (e.g. messaging, AI, NLP, etc.). Each camp company receives pre-seed financing of $200k.
Our second betacamp is voicecamp, focusing on conversational software that interacts with users in a way that is increasingly similar to how humans interact with each other: with our voices.

Betaworks is an American startup studio and seed stage venture capital company based in New York City[1][2][3][4] that invests in network-focused, consumer-facing[vague] media businesses.
Its hybrid investor/builder model has led to both investments in fast-growing startups like Tumblr, Airbnb, Groupon and Twitter as well as more exclusive stakes in internally built startups such as Chartbeat, Bitly and SocialFlow. Betaworks was founded in 2007 by John Borthwick and Andy Weissman.[5]
It has also recently come into the limelight a little more with The Intern podcast, hosted and produced by Allison Behringer. The podcast recounts a young woman beginning her career in the world of technology.[6]
Recently Betaworks was in the news for selling one of its products, called Instapaper to the social media scrapbooking site, Pinterest.[7]
Studio[edit]
Current:

Giphy lets anyone search for animated gifs on the web. It was born out of an experiment by two hackers in residence, Alex Chung and Jace Cooke, who found it difficult to browse the best gifs on the web. It spread unexpectedly quickly, serving millions of results in the first few weeks. "We could tell it struck a nerve, so we swarmed it," said Paul Murphy, the head of product at Betaworks told The Verge [8]
Bloglovin' helps people discover and follow their favorite blogs. The site was founded in Sweden and has over 2 million members, 70% of them who follow fashion blogs & over 90% who are female. Shortly after it took $1 million of investment from Betaworks and Lerer Hippeau Ventures in 2012, traffic spiked following Google's announcement to discontinue Google Reader.[9]
In July 2012, the company acquired the Digg brand and internet assets for USD $500,000[10][11] and merged it with News.me, a social news reading app.
In April 2013, the company acquired a majority stake in Instapaper, before selling it to Pinterest in 2016.[12]
In April 2013, the company released Dots, a video game downloaded over 10 million times.

Former:

Chartbeat, which provides realtime analytics to websites and blogs. It shows visitors, load times, and referring.
Bitly, which that allows users to shorten, share, and track links (URLs). Reducing the URL length makes sharing easier.
SocialFlow, which optimizes the real-time value of content.

Betaworks is an American startup studio and seed stage venture capital company based in New York City[1][2][3][4] that invests in network-focused, consumer-facing[vague] media businesses.
Its hybrid investor/builder model has led to both investments in fast-growing startups like Tumblr, Airbnb, Groupon and Twitter as well as more exclusive stakes in internally built startups such as Chartbeat, Bitly and SocialFlow. Betaworks was founded in 2007 by John Borthwick and Andy Weissman.[5]
It has also recently come into the limelight a little more with The Intern podcast, hosted and produced by Allison Behringer. The podcast recounts a young woman beginning her career in the world of technology.[6]
Recently Betaworks was in the news for selling one of its products, called Instapaper to the social media scrapbooking site, Pinterest.[7]
Studio[edit]
Current:

Giphy lets anyone search for animated gifs on the web. It was born out of an experiment by two hackers in residence, Alex Chung and Jace Cooke, who found it difficult to browse the best gifs on the web. It spread unexpectedly quickly, serving millions of results in the first few weeks. "We could tell it struck a nerve, so we swarmed it," said Paul Murphy, the head of product at Betaworks told The Verge [8]
Bloglovin' helps people discover and follow their favorite blogs. The site was founded in Sweden and has over 2 million members, 70% of them who follow fashion blogs & over 90% who are female. Shortly after it took $1 million of investment from Betaworks and Lerer Hippeau Ventures in 2012, traffic spiked following Google's announcement to discontinue Google Reader.[9]
In July 2012, the company acquired the Digg brand and internet assets for USD $500,000[10][11] and merged it with News.me, a social news reading app.
In April 2013, the company acquired a majority stake in Instapaper, before selling it to Pinterest in 2016.[12]
In April 2013, the company released Dots, a video game downloaded over 10 million times.

Former:

Chartbeat, which provides realtime analytics to websites and blogs. It shows visitors, load times, and referring.
Bitly, which that allows users to shorten, share, and track links (URLs). Reducing the URL length makes sharing easier.
SocialFlow, which optimizes the real-time value of content.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
