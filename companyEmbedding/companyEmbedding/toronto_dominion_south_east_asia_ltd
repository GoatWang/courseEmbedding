TORONTO DOMINION (SOUTH EAST ASIA) LTD. swift code / bic code     WHAT IS A SWIFT / BIC CODE?A Swift Code is the standard format for Business Identifier Codes (BIC) and it's a unique identificationcode for banks and financial institutions globally. These codes are used when transferring money between banks,in particular for international wire transfers or SEPA payments.SWIFT code, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT - BIC (ISO 9362) is a standard format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements. The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.SWIFTCODES BY COUNTRYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZTORONTO DOMINION (SOUTH EAST ASIA) LTD. swift codesBrowse through all available bank swift codes used by TORONTO DOMINION (SOUTH EAST ASIA) LTD.The bic codes below belong to TORONTO DOMINION (SOUTH EAST ASIA) LTD. bank and/or any of its branches  across all countries and cities in the world.Swift codes also known as BIC Codes is a unique bank identifier used to verify financial transactions such as a Bank Wire Transfer.The bank swift code provides information about the bank and branch where the money should be transferred.
