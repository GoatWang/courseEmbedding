CAMP HILL, Pa. & TWINSBURG, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and Envision Pharmaceutical Services (“EnvisionRx”) 
      today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under 
      which Rite Aid will acquire EnvisionRx, a portfolio company of leading 
      global private investment firm TPG, in a transaction valued at 
      approximately $2 billion, which includes the value of an expected future 
      tax benefit of $275 million. Under the terms of the agreement, which has 
      been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, 
      Rite Aid will pay approximately $1.8 billion in cash and $200 million in
Rite Aid stock, or approximately 27.9 million shares.
    


      EnvisionRx is a national, full-service pharmacy benefit management (PBM) 
      company with projected 2015 calendar year revenues of approximately $5 
      billion and projected 2015 calendar year EBITDA in a range of $150 to 
      $160 million. The company provides both transparent and traditional PBM 
      options through its EnvisionRx and MedTrak PBMs, respectively, as well 
      as pharmacy-related services to clients across the nation. EnvisionRx 
      also offers fully integrated mail-order and specialty pharmacy services 
      through Orchard Pharmaceutical Services; access to the nation’s largest 
      cash pay infertility discount drug program via Design Rx; an innovative 
      claims adjudication software platform in Laker Software; and a national 
      Medicare Part D prescription drug plan through Envision Insurance 
      Company’s EnvisionRx Plus product offering.
    

      “The acquisition of EnvisionRx meaningfully expands our health and 
      wellness offerings, enhancing our ability to provide a higher level of 
      care to the patients and communities we serve,” said Rite Aid Chairman 
      and CEO John Standley. “With the addition of EnvisionRx, we will create 
      a compelling pharmacy offering across retail, specialty and mail-order 
      channels, enabling us to deliver cost-effective solutions to employers 
      and health plans while driving growth and creating long-term value for 
      our shareholders. We also look forward to welcoming EnvisionRx’s proven 
      management team and talented associates to Rite Aid.”
    

      “Combining our comprehensive suite of pharmacy benefit management 
      services with Rite Aid’s established retail healthcare platform is a 
      natural fit that is increasingly preferred by plan sponsors,” said 
      EnvisionRx CEO Frank Sheehy. “Together, we see tremendous opportunities 
      to provide new and existing customers with an integrated healthcare 
      offering that will build upon the company’s strong existing platform.”
    

      “EnvisionRx’s innovative business model has always set it apart from 
      other PBMs, and as part of a recognized pharmacy leader, will now be 
      well positioned for further success,” said Sharad Mansukani, chairman of 
      EnvisionRx and senior advisor for TPG. “TPG believes EnvisionRx has 
      built a best-in-class company with tremendous potential, and as a 
      ground-breaking PBM, it has a great future as part of Rite Aid.”
    

      The transaction is expected to be accretive to Rite Aid’s earnings per 
      share in the first full year following the closing of the transaction. 
      The transaction is expected to close by September, 2015, subject to 
      regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
    

      Following the closing, EnvisionRx will operate as a wholly owned 
      subsidiary of Rite Aid led by Frank Sheehy and current management. 
      EnvisionRx’s headquarters will remain in Twinsburg, Ohio.
    

      In connection with the pending transaction, Rite Aid has obtained 
      committed financing from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and BofA Merrill 
      Lynch, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Credit Suisse AG. Subject to 
      market conditions, Rite Aid expects to finance the $1.8 billion cash 
      portion of the consideration through proceeds from the issuance of 
      unsecured notes prior to the closing of the acquisition.
    

      Citigroup Global Markets Inc. served as financial advisor to Rite Aid 
      and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was the 
      company’s legal advisor. J.P. Morgan served as exclusive financial 
      advisor to EnvisionRx, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP acted as 
      its legal counsel.

LINN Energy Announces $340 Million Acquisition From Pioneer Natural Resources






GlobeNewswire



Aug 4, 2014 4:09 PM EDT













 




























































    HOUSTON, Aug. 4, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LINN Energy, LLC (Nasdaq:LINE) ("LINN" or "the Company") and LinnCo, LLC (Nasdaq:LNCO) ("LinnCo") announced today that LINN has signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire assets in the Hugoton Basin from Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) ("Pioneer") for a contract price of $340 million. The assets are currently producing approximately 40 MMcfe/d, approximately 60 percent of which is natural gas, with a shallow base decline of approximately six percent. Total proved reserves are estimated to be approximately 340 Bcfe (approximately 95 percent PDP). The asset package is comprised of approximately 235,000 net acres, all held by production, with approximately 1,200 producing wells. LINN has identified 180 future drilling locations and 150 recompletion opportunities. The Company anticipates the acquisition will close in the third quarter of 2014 with an effective date of July 1, 2014, and will be financed ultimately through the sale of producing and non-producing acreage in LINN's portfolio.                                   "This acquisition further strengthens LINN's significant position in the Hugoton Basin and reinforces our commitment to the previously announced strategic portfolio improvement plan," said Mark E. Ellis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Following our acquisition from BP in 2012, this year's announced trade with ExxonMobil, and today's announcement with Pioneer, LINN will become the largest producer in the field and will have pro forma production in the basin of approximately 275 MMcfe/d and two natural gas processing plants with capacity of 690 MMcfe/d. We also expect this acquisition to be accretive to excess of net cash provided by operating activities after distributions to unitholders."

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

OVERVIEW



Perkins Coie’s Mergers & Acquisitions practice consists of more than 100 dedicated M&A attorneys representing public and private companies and investors in domestic and cross-border mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, carve-outs, spin-offs, recapitalizations, growth equity investments and other transactions.
We represent clients in a wide range of industries, transaction structures and sizes. We have broad and deep experience representing public and private companies in connection with their acquisition programs and roll-up strategies, as well as with acquisitions and sales of public companies, private equity-backed M&A, and venture capital-backed, family-owned and founder-owned exit transactions.


Specialty Areas of Focus


Private Company M&A and Serial Acquisition Programs
Private Equity M&A
Public Company M&A
Carve-Out Transactions
Venture Capital Backed and Emerging Technology Company M&A
Family-Owned and Founder-Owned Exits
Cross-Border and International Transactions



Dedicated Deal Teams
Perkins Coie M&A attorneys are dedicated deal professionals. In many cases, our deal leads are not just M&A generalists, but they also concentrate in one of the specialty areas mentioned above. Our high volume of deals allows us to provide real-time input on market terms and trends. We put the right team and mix of skills and experience on every transaction, helping clients understand approaches to specific types of deals, relevant market trends, and the perspectives and expectations of their counterparties.
Full-Service Advantage
As a full-service Am Law 50 law firm, Perkins Coie receives ongoing recognition from Chambers USA and other professional rankings for excellence in more than 150 practices and 30 industry groups. Our deep bench of seasoned deal attorneys is backed by equally well-staffed teams in key deal support areas, such as securities, intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, employee benefits and antitrust. We establish a comprehensive deal team that provides efficient deal execution, in-depth due diligence and integration services. We are known for distinctive, insightful and cost-effective approaches to due diligence, particularly in connection with transactions for which technical and operational due diligence and post-closing integration are critical.   Intellectual Property and Technology are notable practice strengths. Ranked by Law360 as one of the largest IP practices in the country, our team includes more than 250 lawyers focused on IP litigation, patent and trademark prosecution, technology licensing, copyrights, and trade secret and unfair competition counseling who work with companies in all technologies and industries around the world. If warranted, we can provide an in-depth dive into a target’s IP portfolio and help our buy-side clients identify issues, mitigate against risks posed by those issues and integrate with their own portfolios. For sell-side clients, we help anticipate transaction roadblocks posed by IP and technology issues, and proactively propose solutions to help navigate toward a successful exit. 
Our Securities Litigation and White Collar & Investigations practices are also differentiators. The attorneys in these groups have been highly successful in defeating lawsuits seeking to enjoin M&A transactions across the country, including in the Delaware Chancery Court. Our litigators provide valuable counseling regarding fiduciary duties and litigation risks, and work in real time with their corporate deal leads at the front end of transactions to minimize disruption and risk. They respond promptly to litigation-related questions and issues that often arise in connection with our M&A matters.  In particular, our litigation team can be called upon to:

Provide Pre-Closing Litigation Counseling (e.g., risk assessment and mitigation strategies)
Respond to Stockholder Demand Letters
Negotiate and Respond to Delaware Rule 220 Stockholder Inspection Demands  
Defend Stockholder Class Action Lawsuits Challenging Mergers in State & Federal Courts, including DE Chancery Court, and
Defend Stockholder Derivative Lawsuits in State & Federal Courts

Private Company M&A and Serial Acquisition Programs 
Undertaking an acquisition, whether for the first time or as a seasoned acquirer, can be a daunting, long and expensive undertaking. We offer a team-oriented approach that combines deep knowledge and experience in M&A, intellectual property, privacy, tax, employee benefits and real estate with sophisticated counsel that maximizes efficiency and value, streamlines delivery time and reduces client costs.
Focusing primarily on middle-market deals, we work with many of the country’s most well-known companies and countless “serial acquirers” on their acquisition programs and roll-up strategies. These clients value dedicated deal teams, consistency in approach to deal terms and risk allocation, and a due diligence process that positions them well for successful integration.
In terms of staffing deals, we start by establishing a core deal team for each client to maintain consistency and continuity, and if the need arises, we have the depth to handle multiple deals simultaneously for a client. Our deal teams can draw on experienced transactional lawyers with a wide range of functional specialties, including securities, tax, intellectual property, antitrust, benefits and labor. This enables us to ensure that deals are structured properly and meet the client's strategic and economic objectives.
In an effort to improve deal predictability, enhance process efficiency and ensure clear communication, we have developed a tool that helps to guide in-house lawyers in analyzing the complexity of each M&A transaction, allowing Perkins Coie to then prepare custom budget and staffing plans. View representative clients and experience. 
Private Equity M&A
Our Private Equity practice is a leader in the representation of private equity funds and firms and their portfolio companies. We emphasize middle-market transactions that typically involve domestic or overseas companies with enterprise values up to $1 billion. Our private equity-focused M&A attorneys represent investors at all stages of the portfolio company investment cycle, from new platform acquisitions and add-on acquisitions to full- or partial-sale liquid events. 
Selling to Private Equity Funds and Their Portfolio Companies It is critical for sellers to understand the unique concerns of private equity funds and the structures they utilize for their investments.  We draw heavily on the experience of our dedicated private equity attorneys to help our sell-side clients navigate these issues. Private equity funds often approach risk allocation issues, tax structuring, and representation and warranty insurance, among other things, in a much different manner than would an operating company or “strategic” buyer. Our experience with private equity transactions enables us to also advise sellers regarding equity rollovers and post-closing employment and consulting arrangements sought by private equity funds. View representative clients and experience.
Public Company M&A
We regularly represent public companies and their boards of directors in connection with strategic alternatives, including sale of the company. We also represent clients in connection with acquisitions of public companies. Our attorneys keep current on the law and trends impacting fiduciary duties, sale processes and transaction structures. Beyond the “big picture” issues, our deal teams bring the right capabilities to bear on every transaction.     Public company acquisitions, and the process that precedes them, present a unique set of challenges for target companies, buyers and their respective boards and management teams, including governance and fiduciary issues, disclosure questions, antitrust matters, and tax and other deal structuring considerations. Our team of seasoned public company M&A lawyers is well-equipped to help steer sell-side clients through a public company sale process, from the initial evaluation of defensive tactics to the negotiation of deal protection measures to a successful closing, and is well-complemented by our deep bench of securities law experts who regularly represent some of the country’s most respected public companies in day-to-day disclosure, compliance and governance issues. View representative clients and experience.
Carve-Out Transactions 
Perkins Coie's M&A practice includes substantial experience representing buyers and sellers in "carve-out" transactions involving acquisitions or dispositions of divisions or business units. Carve-outs involve a range of legal issues arising from the fact that divisions and business units are typically not easily disentangled from their parent company. Often, there are overlapping assets, liabilities, contracts, intellectual property rights, employees, and shared services that must be addressed to ensure the acquired business can operate on a standalone basis under new ownership.
Perkins Coie’s M&A team understands the attraction of carve-out transactions to sellers and both strategic and financial buyers. We have extensive experience helping sellers refocus on their core business through the divesture of divisions or subsidiaries, as well as helping buyers acquire assets as a catalyst to drive growth. We know how to navigate through the complex issues involved in carve-outs and bring the right combination of resources to bear to ensure these transactions are properly executed. View representative clients and experience.
Venture Capital Backed and Emerging Technology Company M&A
Our Emerging Companies & Venture Capital lawyers are passionate about representing venture capital-backed technology companies and have extensive experience in advising companies in their exit strategies. Our team has handled hundreds of exit events for VC-backed clients. Our representation of many of today’s high-growth startups in stock acquisitions and sales, joint ventures and strategic alliances provides us with broad and deep experience negotiating and closing deals quickly and efficiently. View representative clients and experience.
Family Owned and Founder-Owned Exits 
Selling a family business can pose challenges that result from multiple owners and stakeholders in a business, family dynamics, and the connection certain family members may have with a business. With decades of experience working with family businesses, our lawyers are sensitive to the unique dynamics and challenges of selling a family business. We work with business owners to find answers that help develop a road map, preparing them for what will likely be the biggest financial event in their lives. Our M&A team prepares clients to ensure that the sale of their businesses is on well-understood and acceptable terms. View representative clients and experience.
Cross-Border and International Transactions
Perkins Coie has a long history of actively participating in the growth of the global economy. Starting in 1916 with our work incorporating The Boeing Company, we have continued to work with domestic and international clients to pioneer international markets and projects. We regularly serve as lead M&A counsel on transactions that involve target companies with operations and assets outside of the United States. We also represent non-U.S. companies seeking to acquire assets and companies in the United States. In each case, we draw on the knowledge of our traditional M&A practice teams, our International practice and our tested network of firms outside of the United States to offer clients a seamless and efficient legal solution for multijurisdictional M&A engagements.

We focus on $0-5M deal sizes and seek a 2X ROI in 3-5 years w/o reliance on commodity price appreciation.The recent fall in oil commodity prices has created a buying opportunity for investors as cash-strapped oil companies seek to restore their balance sheets and begin to divest of their working interests in proven oil and gas wells. Private investment funds like ours can presently find opportunities in the petroleum industry that were inconceivable only a few short years ago. We are now seeing opportunities to acquire prime leasehold interests in the heart of America’s energy producing areas. With the price of oil near all-time lows, and recent announcements by OPEC to limit oil production output, a tremendous window of opportunity exists for Fund investors.The Fund’s objectives include the targeting of an area of the oil and gas leasehold acquisition and divestiture market that tends to be relatively inefficient due to low asset valuations and are thus often overlooked by larger acquisition funds. Our overall objective is to realize capital appreciation and provide a sustainable income stream from our Investments. We expect that our Investments will typically be in leasehold working interests, royalty interests, mineral rights, completion activities, development drilling and other energy investments. Products / Services Investment Membership UnitsMembership Units within the Acquisition Fund priced at $100,000 each.
