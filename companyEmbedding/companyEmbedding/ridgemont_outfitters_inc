HOVER HIKER
by Ridgemont Outfitters on Apr 01, 2016




At Ridgemont we’re committed to making the great outdoors accessible to even very lazy people, so we’ve developed the Hover Hiker…
Oh man, this is starting to feel a bit too real.
APRIL FOOLS!
Although, we’re pretty surprised this doesn’t already exist, we hope it never does. Keep on hiking!

CLEARANCE




















 
The Ridgemont Outback II is our most versatile style. Constructed of durable 2mm waxed full grain leather, waxed cotton canvas, a bespoke open cell insole and a hi-density 100% rubber, lugged vulcanized outsole, it's designed to stand up to all but the most extreme environments.  NEW for this version is a lockstitch side seam for an ultra secure outsole bond and a BiFit composite lasting board for enhanced durability, comfort and improved flex in the forefoot.  In addition each colour has a full DWR (durable water repellent) coating so any moisture just beads off the leather.
Unlike most other hiking boots, it's not so bulky that you'll look like you just got finished hiking the Muir trail if you feel like grabbing some breakfast after your morning hike. Outside magazine said 'This Boot Can Do Anything!'. We tend to agree!
Plus it's now available down to a men's size US5 for the younger hikers and also the fairer ones..

Why I Like Ridgemont Outfitters



When I consider an investment, my criteria is not just investing in a great idea, but also the leadership I am investing in. In Ridgemont, not only is it a great product and innovative concept, the founders Alex & Stacy have the combined knowledge, experience and passion to make Ridgemont a success and a global brand. In the first two years Ridgemont has already challenged the traditional outdoor footwear market and has established itself as a truly viable alternative. Ridgemont now has a good direct to consumer revenue stream and through these channels it is positioned well to continue to grow quickly. Simply, I bet on Ridgemont and Alex and Stacy because I believe in the product and concept, and that the founders are the right executive team to make it a huge success.

THE BUZZ ABOUT RIDGEMONT OUTFITTERS




The Montys really proved their meddle, however, when we left the trail, cleaned the mud off, and then walked into the grocery store. They were as suitable there as they had been in the wild. That’s what’s great about these boots; they’re equally at home in town and in the woods. They’re made for people who live in both of those worlds and want to be able to cross back and forth without having to change shoes halfway through. Just make sure you kick the mud off before you head into the bar.


Wade Ellett

I’m a huge fan of the outdoor look, but it’s really nice when you can blend it with something a little more refined. The Ridgemont shoe lineup does this perfectly, with a stylish shoe lineup carrying options for every occasion.

Ridgemont Outfitters: The ultimate do-it-all travel shoes

Gear Review: Ridgemont Outfitters Monty Hi Boots

Last year, in need of some new hiking boots, I decided to take a shot on a pair from Ridgemont Outfitters, a company I'd been following on Instagram for some time. I didn't know much about the company or their products other than I really liked their social media presence.

       *These revenue projections are based on web sales growth over the previous years plus one planned collaboration Kickstarter project per quarter.  Additionally, the increased marketing budget from the Wefunder, spent digitally and traditionally, will generate more web traffic and increased conversions. 




For instance, over the last seven weeks we have signed up with a digital marketing agency that has already achieved a return on digital ad spend of 3.25X+. As they fine tune the audiences and advert content we hope to push that return past 4X. We then plan to slowly increase the daily amounts that we spend with Facebook and also with Google Adwords & Shopping whilst maintaining a 3-4X return on ad spend.  Once the funding is successful we would also introduce affiliate advertising on industry blogs plus allocate a budget for more traditional print marketing with direct to consumer catalogues and event attendance (festivals etc).


           We also plan to launch new products once-a-quarter on Kickstarter. The first one this Winter hit $75k and the second one for Q2 is due to go live in late April. We expect an even more successful campaign given the broad appeal of the new campaign. We already have the projects for Q3 & Q4 planned out, a USA made luggage line and a collaboration shoe with the national parks brand, Parks Project, respectively.  With the combination of all these initiatives I am confident in attaining the conservative numbers we have suggested. Now that we have switched our attention 100% to direct to consumer we can drive the sales up quickly and then revisit wholesale for the next push in 18 months time.


          There is no guarantee that the numbers will materialize as projected. Projections for 2017 and later are dependent on variables outside of our control and may not materialize as displayed.

Customers, Reviews, & Founder Interviews

"The time that I get on the water is my release. Fishing is freedom to me. "
          

 - Justin Reynolds, Professional Angler and Skateboarder and Ridgemont Delegate














"Ridgemont is shoes for your entire life. Shoes to take you from the trail, to breakfast in the morning, to work, to dinner at night. 

This is a really good middle ground between full blown hiking and a floppy skate shoe. "
          

- Stacy Lowry, Founder














"What’s important here is that you get a stylish boot that is built to be taken off the track but still looks good enough to be worn any time of day. You can easily pair these with some jeans or some khakis. "
          

- Isaac Tud, Footwear Critic




Designed By Us For Us
Rugged construction coupled with high class style 

     We've spent years designing and perfecting our shoes. We use the same leather tanneries as Timberland and Wolverine and combine that high quality grain leather with bullet proof construction to ensure your feet are protected in any situation.
    





Where most vulcanized shoes use a Texon lasting board, Ridgemont uses a custom composite lasting board to provide variable flex characteristics along the length of the shoe. We wanted a shoe that would be very flexible at the ball of the foot (since that’s pretty important for walking!) but more rigid from the arch to the heel so the shoe is more rugged over uneven terrain. This is also one of the main reasons our shoes are super comfortable right out of the box.





All Ridgemont shoes are stitched together with non-wicking thread in order to prevent the cotton from pulling moisture through the upper into the lining. As the natural fibre thread gets moist it expands slightly to ‘block’ the stitch hole and seal the moisture out. Clever huh?





We use only the best full grain cow leather from European hides dyed in tanneries that are gold rated for their environmentally responsible processes. We treat our leather with various oils and waxes to ensure that the leather itself is waterproof as verified by the shoe authorities at SATRA. Of course, we stitch our shoes together (poke holes in them) so we don’t claim our shoes are 100% waterproof, but they are more water resistant than most light hikers on the market. 




We worked directly with Ortholite utilizing their patented Open Cell Foam Technology to develop an insole that would be extremely comfortable, yet not completely isolate you from your environment. Additionally, and we feel super importantly, we designed real arch support to help abate fatigue and keep your arches well formed and not flat as a board. The foam in our insoles is anti-microbial, non-absorbing, and it will never compress more than 5%.








                Gusseted tongues are designed to keep dust and debris from getting into your shoe through the throat opening. We didn’t invent them, but we’re one of the few outdoor lifestyle brands that use them, and the next time you walk through a field without getting a briar, thorn or annoying little stone in your shoe, you’ll be glad we do.





              Vulcanization is a process of chemically bonding materials together using high heat. If done right, this creates very strong bonds and allows for a unique “board feel”. We tap in to these characteristics and improve upon them for use in the outdoors with a harder 70 A rubber along with 3mm thick foxing to improve lateral and torsional stiffness. We believe that feeling the earth beneath your feet is a benefit, and something that has been all but eliminated from most hiking boots. 



We worked hard to find the ideal outsole thickness which allows us maintain our connection to the terrain, while still providing protection from rocks, or the dreaded Lego block your kid left on the wood floors! In addition to paying close attention to our outsoles thickness, we were very mindful of providing as much grip as possible in a variety of terrains. The softness of the rubber (70 asker) combined with the thickness and slightly lugged tread pattern provides comfort and grip.  




There’s something about canvas shoes that we just love. Maybe it’s the texture or the way they feel. What it isn’t is their ability to stand up to the elements. We want our canvas shoes to perform better, so we take our raw material and impregnate it with a 14% dry wax layer. This gives a natural canvas look but creates a water resistant barrier to prevent moisture coming through the fabric. Finally we add a water repellent coating for a final top moisture barrier.

I participated in only hardcore activities, and I expected the things I spent my money on to furnish me with an uncompromising purity of design. All or nothing. Do or die.




That was then. I’m not old, in fact, I’m still quite young compared to many land tortoises and mountain ranges, but I’ve seen the world and experienced a lifetime of, uh, experiences. Not that much has changed, really. I still follow my passions with the heat soaking tenacity of an electric blanket, but I increasingly find myself searching for compromise. Compromise, in fact, was the inspiration for Ridgemont. The fact is, I don’t often forge rivers, but I do cross the occasional puddle. I don’t climb mountains, but I regularly climb hills. I’ve never hiked the Appalachian trail, but I hike the trail by my house all the time. I hike lots of trails, and not once has a mountain suddenly sprung up in front of me.


 You see what I’m saying? I want some traction. I want some water resistance. I want some durability, but I don’t want to look like I’m about to summit Denali. I go places and have adventures and I need great quality gear that won’t let me down, but I’m not exploring Mars. I’ll surely never explore Mars, so I don’t need boots built to survive a Martian winter, and blend in with the Martian natives. I need to hike to the surf break, then go get a breakfast burrito. I need to walk my dog, then go to the office. I want to go on vacation to far flung places, but I’ve got to navigate an airport before I can get there, which definitely doesn’t require more spikes than a football boot. I wanted great looking, well made, simply styled shoes and clothes. 


I couldn’t find it so I made it. I named it Ridgemont. And I’d love for you to join us on this adventure.
Sincerely,


            Stacy Lowery

                  Take us back to the beginning. How did you get started?
                  



I started importing small brands in the early 90's, when snowboarding was first big on the scene. I was the first UK distributor for well known board brands like LibTech, Gnu and Ride, as well as Northwave snowboard boots, and a variety of clothing brands. Snowboarding was a new sport. I was the importer for the UK and spent quite a lot of time traveling to and from California, mostly dealing with US brands. Off the back of that, I got into fashion footwear through the Northwave brand that's based out of Italy and as such, spent quite a lot of time in Italy, where I learned about shoe manufacturing. I picked up the distribution for DuFFS skate shoes for the UK in the mid 90's, just after they launched. I then took on the European distribution and license for DuFFS apparel. I used to make DuFFS branded tees, sweats, jeans, bags, etc and sell them across Europe. Ultimately, it reached the point where our DuFFS business was bigger than the North American DuFFS business, and so we approached the owners and bought the brand from them in 2008.  That was a pretty trying time because that was just as the whole world went into global recession and meltdown! We fought our way through that, and we sold the brand in 2012 and then set Ridgemont up.

Stacy Lowery, co-founder of Ridgemont, was head of design for DuFFS, and an ex pro skateboarder. He went on his honeymoon to Costa Rica, hiking, and before going he wanted to buy some suitable shoes to go hiking in. All he could find were some ugly black or brown hiking boots that he didn't feel comfortable wearing, and so he approached me and said, "I think there's a niche market here for fashionable outdoor footwear." He then did some drawings, and I said it seemed like a good idea, and Ridgemont was born. This happened in 2012. We then took a year, we were just sort of checking the market thinking that maybe we just missed something and there were people doing it. It probably took another year to totally convince ourselves, and then we started working on our design towards the end of 2013.




                  Where have the last few years gotten you?
                  



Initially it's all about finding vendors that will make the product, it's designing and creating the brand, the brand aesthetic, all of which took a little bit of time. Just coming up with a name takes a lot more effort than you think it's going to. We both had experience manufacturing in the Far East, but we still had to find factories that could do the quality that we expected. That also took time, as well, as a lot of traveling to China. Once we found factories that we could work with and would work with us, because it's hard for startups to get into a good factory, we then developed the first range, which consisted of two boots and two shoes. Then we went to our first  trade show, Agenda, in Long Beach. It was just when the outdoor movement suddenly started becoming quite cool. There were a few other brands in a similar place as us; brands like Topo Designs and Poler Stuff, who are not reinventing the outdoor product, but trying to sort of drag it forward and make it a bit more aesthetically fashionable and pleasing. We launched at Agenda and we got a great response.

We also were approached by a few retailers; one of the key ones we work with is in San Francisco, called Huckberry. They saw the potential immediately. Some of the other more traditional retailers are much slower when it comes to trying something new. We have had to plug away at that, and that's what we've been doing for the last two and a half years.  We’ve been attending trade shows, visiting with retailers, letting them see that we're still here, still around. Now they're finally committing. We’ve just been picked up for next autumn by REI, which is the biggest outdoor chain in North America.

We have a mirror operation in Europe, because I'm English and know the UK & European market. We have a warehouse facility in California and  a warehouse facility in Southampton in the UK and dual websites: a US website working in US currency that supplies North America and Canada, and one based in the UK which supplies the UK and Europe. Whilst the websites were there originally for promotional purposes, we also had Shopify e-commerce shops attached to them, and the online shops have actually been outperforming our expectations. They've been growing steadily, which has been great. It confirms what we thought, that consumers like our stuff.  I'm not a retailer, I've been a wholesaler for twenty years and so it's been a bit of a learning curve, but I think we're doing a pretty good job of it. That's one area, once this financing goes through, that we'll invest some money into and develop further.




                  Who are your customers?
                  



Our customer, according to Google Analytics, is 25-55, ABC1, relatively affluent, disposable income, travels, has keen interest in outdoor pursuits whether that be hiking, camping, climbing, surfing, or skating. Very much an outdoor active person. They want to be able to walk the dog, go for a hike, or go camping on the weekend; throw the tent in the back of the pickup and drive off up to Yosemite or wherever, but then they could just as well wear the same shoes if they're going out for dinner or down to the park or to the office. It's an all purpose product, and that's what our customer wants.

They probably have a pair of Keen or a pair of Lowas or Salomon or similar, and then they'd probably have a pair of Vans or Converse for more casual wear. I know when we've done photo shoots, and on a couple of occasions we didn't have sizes for some of the guys, they wore Vans or Converse and their feet got shredded just on a 15 mile hike. They definitely need something. As a result, our product works very well for travellers. We get quite a lot of gap year students who are in between from college to university who go off traveling for 6 months. It's perfect for them, they're going to backpack so they only want to carry one pair of shoes.




                  Who are your competitors? What do you understand that they don’t get?
                  



Brands like Merrell, North Face, Timberland & New Balance are offering something similar, but they don't offer the same technical specifications that we do at the same price points. From an entry level, we offer  water resistant products right the way up to our top of the range styles, which are fully waterproof and  breathable. No one else really does that at our prices.  For that level of technical specification from other brands, you start getting into price points which are double ours, up in the $300 area.

Within skate shoes, and the lifestyle fashion market, where a lot of my background is, people are always looking for something new. Whereas traditionally in the outdoor market they're not necessarily looking for something new, they're looking for something reliable that they know and they trust.

We want to give them both something reliable that they know and trust but that is also fashionable.  Form and function.




                  Why will you win?
                  



There's always people that want to be different. They don't want to have what everyone else has, and those people always shy away from the big brands. That's something which I'm very aware of from my days of working in skate and surf; there are always people looking for something fresh.

Bigger brands are copying our aesthetic but they're not copying us from a performance point of view. They have a boot that looks similar to ours, but it just looks similar, it doesn't have a waterproof breathable liner, for example. It doesn't have all the extra features that we throw in, because they can't afford to do it. The big companies need a bigger margin because they're a bigger machine. They have a wholesale margin that is probably 20 or 30 percent bigger than ours because they need that to pay for all the offices and all the staff.

Stacy and I are both very keen on the performance of our footwear. That’s one of the fundamentals of Ridgemont; fashionable but functional outdoor footwear.  We are constantly improving the product, so we're already on the 3rd version of a couple of the shoes because we're finessing our offering.  Nobody else really puts into outdoor shoes or sneaker boots the features that we put in for the price we sell for.

 Performance, quality, the materials - we use the same leather tanneries that the Timberlands and the Wolverines do. Similarly, the factories we use also make for all the well known brands, too.  They are all gold registered eco/environmentally friendly factories to make sure that they recycle, repurpose and reuse wherever they can to protect the environment. The factories are all clean,  tidy and a great working space. They have to be like that because they have to compete with all of the electronics factories that are making for Apple/Samsung etc. To get the workers to come and work for the shoe factories, they have to provide the same sort of environment.




                  Can you talk more about the design and production process?
                  



Everything is made in southern China in gold rated environmentally friendly factories. They're in an area called Dongguan, which is a big shoe making area and also very big for electronics; Apple makes most of its products there. The Samsung factory is right around the corner from one of our factories. There are all very good quality and reliable vendors.

The design is majoritively done by Stacy.  With wholesale we would do two collections a year and work 12 to 18 months out.  Now that we're focussing on direct to consumer we can draw then sample a style and if we like to go straight to production.  Concept to retail in less than 6 months.  It's great to have that freedom to bring new styles to life so much quicker and not having to rely on the approval of the wholesale market before proceeding.  We're now aiming to bring out new styles every 3 months.

We've got various silhouettes that are working for us, so what we tend to do once we get a silhouette that's working well, for example Outback and Monty Hi, then we go vertically where we'll do different materials, different levels of waterproofness, and that way we vary the price offering. Trying to offer lots and lots of different patterns is obviously expensive because you have lots of development and mold costs.  But taking one style that you know works and then offering a variety of colours, materials etc is quicker and easier to execute.




                  How do you make money?
                  



We aim to set our retail prices based on min x4 landed cost.  $20 landed cost for $80 retail, $50 for $200 etc. a 75% gross margin. When we're wholesaling we're only going to be making around less than 50% before sales related costs, volume discounts and trade shows etc.  So in effect we have to sell x3+ pairs at wholesale to make the same amount of $ profit as one pair at retail. That's what is great about the economics with the direct to consumer sales, it's so much more profitable.

Because we're small we're flexible, and we can get the factories we work with to make as little as 300 pairs of a color for us, whereas standard factories want 2,400 pairs. As we grow, and we order more, we can increase our margins. There's definitely scope. We have a guy on the ground in China working for us. He already knows he can get better deals, he just needs to have volume coming through.

We also keep our overheads tight by using 3PL, (third party logistic) warehouses, so we don't have an on-going large financial responsibility - we just pay per unit for them to pick and pack and store, which is great. It means when you're busy it costs a little bit more, but when you're not busy it's a lot cheaper, you don't have a lot of staff sitting around running up a bill.




                  What ideas do you have for growth in the next 3 months? 12?
                  



Now that we are focussing on direct to consumer sales we are seeing steady growth in revenues.  Sales for 2016 doubled to $342,000 and Q1 2017 was 320% up on Q1 2016.  We are focussing on digital marketing, PR and print advertising to increase brand awareness and drive sales through our e-commerce site.  We're upgrading our website constantly and introducing more and more retail features to increase conversion rates and drive sales.

In addition we are introducing new styles and products on crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo.  This gives us an opportunity to test market reaction to products before committing to manufacture.  We have several new shoe styles, some as collaborations with other brands to showcase, plus luggage and accessory projects.

We expect to grow revenues to $800k+ in 2017 and expand into other territories.  We already have a fledging following in Europe but we hope to grow that more and more over the next 12 months.  Once direct sales are $1m+ with a 70%+ margin then we will revisit wholesale. We have good nationwide retail partners in the US that are interested in working with us once our awareness has increased and we already have international interest from distributors in Europe, Asia & Australia.




                  What’s next for your business? Why are you raising money now?
                  



We've created the Ridgemont brand, and we know people love it when they find it. The conversion rate on our website is over 4%.  We need to continue to increase awareness to drive more people to our site.  To do that we are investing significantly in digital marketing through Facebook, Instagram & Google as well as traditional PR activities and we have plans to do some print marketing with direct to consumer catalogues and event attendance at festivals etc.

In addition we want to expand the offering of styles and colours and materials of footwear and branch into luggage, apparel and accessories.

To do both of these things we need to raise money, some will go to fund production, to be able to make Ridgemont shoes and product to sell, but the bulk of it will go into our marketing efforts. 




                  What’s been your largest challenge so far?
                  



The biggest headache has definitely been wholesale. The retailers visit us and see the new products and say, "I love it, but I just don't see a place for it in my store." You tend to get an older senior buyer, and then you get a younger assistant buyer. The assistant buyer is all over us saying, "We should stock this," and then the senior buyer is, "Oh, I'm not sure, I'm not sure." and then it doesn't happen.

That's been the frustration, which is why it has led us to now focus on the direct consumer.  By appealing directly to the consumers who support us and we know love the brand we can sidestep the retailer who isn't willing to commit yet and bring Ridgemont to it's core fans.




                  This is an unusual fundraising strategy. Why have you given your customers the chance to invest online via Wefunder?
                  



The main reason is because obviously banks are very asset-based when they want to lend money, which makes it quite hard as a small business because we don't have the assets to borrow against. Plus, we know how much our consumers love what we do, and we feel that they'll want us to succeed and if we can give them a good return on $100, $500 or $1,000 or whatever they feel comfortable investing with us plus some great perks, then they get the benefit of not just getting a great return but that they've done something and helped a company and philosophy move forward.




                  Can you tell us about the team?
                  



I'm the President/CEO (Alex Hall), and then there's my co-founder Stacy Lowery, he's the creative director. He's responsible for new products and also the look and feel of the brand. John Lacroix is our digital marketing guru and Stephen Tims is our head of operations and handles all of the logistics and makes sure everything is where it should be and gets sent to the right people. We also have Carlos, who despite his name is Chinese, and is based in Dongguan in southern China. He has 20+ years of manufacturing footwear for lots of well known brands and handles all our production.




                  What keeps you up at night about the business?
                  



The biggest frustration to date is that we haven't progressed as quickly as I expected. Accepting that wholesale is going to take longer than we expected and instead concentrating on direct to consumer in the short term has definitely helped us move forward again.  Once we have a solid base, we can revisit wholesale and we will have more brand awareness and it will be easier to make it a success. We've got something which we know is good, everyone I share it with tells me it's great, and we've never had a bit of bad press. We’ve maybe had 120 articles across loads of different publications that everyone tells us how wonderful the product is. Translating that from what we know is a great product into hard sales has been a big frustration but I am now confident we know our path and the recent changes are definitely paying dividends already.




                  What is your cash on hand and burn rate?
                  



As of 31 March 2017, the company had approximately $32K cash (or cash equivalents) and $117K of fully paid up inventory. It operates at a run rate of approximately $10K per month.

Risks Specific to Ridgemont Outfitters


1.
                  Ridgemont already has revenue but not enough to cover existing expenses.  There are two revenue streams, 1. wholesale sales to national & international retailers and distributors and 2. direct retail sales to e-commerce consumers through our website.  The gross margin on combined sales is close to covering expenses and an increase in revenue will make that possible.  There is a risk that sales will not grow enough to cover overheads.
                

2.
                  Whilst wholesale sales are growing and Ridgemont has attracted some good retailers to partner with from Summer 2017, there is a risk that product may not sell through in-store as quickly as anticipated and retailers may choose other brands and/or discount product to de-value the brands.  In addition there is also a risk that the retailers may fail without paying for supplied product.  Ridgemont has an agreement in place with a New York based factoring company and intends to only supply retailers that it can credit insure to alleviate the risk of non-payment.
                

3.
                  There are production risks that we will not be able to supply product to meet demand due to factory issues in Southern China including poor quality and factories going out of business.   However the senior management have extensive experience of producing footwear & apparel in the area and in addition Ridgemont employs a locally based agent who has 30 years experience in Southern China footwear production.
                

4.
                  Competition in the outdoor footwear market is strong and there are many well know established brands.  Whilst Ridgemont represents a different approach to technical outdoor footwear there is a risk that the established brands will copy its approach and use their larger distribution network and marketing power to force Ridgemont out of the wholesale market.  However with the introduction of direct to consumer sales and marketing as well as the appetite to champion smaller brands among the public, Ridgemont should still be successful.
