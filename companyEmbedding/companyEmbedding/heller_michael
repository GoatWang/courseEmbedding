Michael Heller - Uncertain Poetries

Paperback, 256pp, 9x6ins 
	Download a PDF sampler from this book here.

	These essays concern the uncertain nature of twentieth-century poetry. Dealing with such major figures as Pound, Stevens, Moore, Oppen, Duncan, Niedecker, Lorca, Rilke and Mallarmé and of poets in more contemporary modernist and post-modernist lineages, they examine how these poets articulate, virtually in the same breath, both affirmation and doubt concerning poetry, history and knowledge.

	 

	"For decades, Michael Heller has been making in his poetry one of the most careful explorations we have of the lyric imagination. For nearly as long, readers have relied on Conviction's Net of Branches as their gateway into understanding the Objectivists. In 2000, Heller offered us Living Root, one of the great spiritual autobiographies in the American poetic idiom. What a pleasure to have these essays, then, collected in Uncertain Poetries, as an affirmation of the depth and seriousness of Heller's engagement with lyric properties, and as a testament to the vibrancy of his thought and to the admirable intensity of his questioning mind." —Peter O'Leary

	"Michael Heller is not only one of our finest poets; he is also one of our best thinkers and prose writers, someone for whom thought is aesthetic. In this volume poetry is the object of exquisite meditations that show it to be alive, delicate — and yet the most powerful force in human affairs. Written under the aegis of an uncertainty that embodies the condition of modernity, Heller's prose is at once supremely intelligent and knowing, deeply philosophical and ruminative, and utterly graceful. What other poet or scholar could be more illuminating? Heller's contribution to our understanding of the poetic act, language, more broadly civilization, is truly extraordinary. It will remain with us for a very long time." —Burt Kimmelman

	"Michael Heller believes with Louis Zukofsky that poetry offers ‘precise information on existence.' Uncertain Poetries proves the point, coupling generosity of attention with precisions that are as vital as they are unassuming." —Peter Nicholls

Michael J. Heller


Recent News:Michael Heller Named a 2017 Distinguished Leader by The Legal IntelligencerThe Distinguished Leaders award recognizes lawyers who achieved impressive results in the past year and demonstrated clear leadership skills that helped them achieve those results. More

	Michael J. Heller is the president and chief executive officer of Cozen O'Connor. He serves on the firm's board of directors, management committee, and heads the emerging business and venture capital practice. Michael approaches each situation with an entrepreneurial zeal, and his investing experience arms him with a unique ability to provide legal and business insight into a variety of complex corporate matters. He understands, first hand, the critical roles of modern executives.

	Michael is a recognized leader in the representation of entrepreneurs and emerging growth companies and began his career as a young associate during the IPO craze of the late 1980s before joining Cozen O’Connor in 1994 as the firm's first transactional lawyer. Since 2007, when Michael became chair of the business law group, he grew the department from 76 attorneys to 190, expanding both the client base and the diversity of the attorneys in the firm. An important element of Michael’s practice is making the necessary introductions to help clients raise capital and find joint venture partners and he is constantly relied upon for his business acumen and investment instincts. Michael is responsible for assisting clients in all industries and plays an active role from the formation and business planning stages to structuring and negotiating joint ventures and strategic alliances. He also represents venture capital funds and angel investor groups in all forms of equity and debt capital-raising transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and beyond.

	Michael is a frequent speaker on venture capital and entrepreneurism in the Mid-Atlantic region and is regularly quoted as a thought leader in local, regional and national publications. He is Chambers-ranked for Corporate Law - M&A and private equity and in 2015 was named by the Philadelphia Business Journal as one of the most influential people in the Philadelphia region. Michael has been named a Pennsylvania "Super Lawyer" by Law Politics from 2004 to present.

	Michael has significant personal business and investing experience, which differentiates him from his peers in the venture capital and private equity space.  He is currently an owner of the Valley Forge Convention Center, which includes the Valley Forge Casino, and is actively involved in investments in real estate and other entrepreneurial businesses. Michael was an early investor and continues to be a principal owner of Beachbody, LLC, the creator of the popular fitness programs P90X and Insanity, and helped Beachbody raise the capital to grow that company to its current stature as the leading health and fitness direct marketing company in the country.

	In addition to his personal investment experience, Michael is a member of the board of directors of four publicly registered funds, FS Investment Corporation I, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and FS Energy and Power Fund, as well as Beachbody, LLC, Valley Forge Convention Center Partners GP, LLC, and Hanover Fire and Casualty Co. He also sits on several nonprofit boards, including Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Villanova Law School, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania (BFTP), Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and Greater Philadelphia Alliance for Capital and Technology (PACT).

	Born and raised in the Philadelphia area, Michael received his undergraduate degree in 1986, summa cum laude, from The Pennsylvania State University, and his law degree in 1989, magna cum laude, from Villanova University, where he was a law review editor and a member of the Order of the Coif.

Michael Heller Discusses the Challenges Among Law Firm Leaders Today in The Philadelphia Business Journal


            			            December 13, 2013
					            

                                    ​In an article titled “How past law leaders would function in today’s legal world,” Cozen O’Connor CEO Michael Heller discusses whether law firm managers of the 1990s and 2000s could thrive in today’s legal market. The business of running a law firm has changed dramatically since the recession hit in 2008 and clients have increasingly more power in the relationship between law firms and the clients, who have tightened legal budgets and demand a high level of value from the firms they employ. Law firm leaders now are faced with new challenges, including staffing, hiring, real estate, budgeting and weaker demand. Additionally, technology is ever-evolving and leaders must adapt to new advances. Michael Heller states “with technology, leaders 20 years ago did not have time to think about some of that. It’s a critical component today and changing daily. Rate pressure, efficiency, alternative fee arrangements. These issues are not new but they are more prevalent than they were back then.”
