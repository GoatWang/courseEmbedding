Good day, my name is Danielle. I would like to welcome everyone to Virgin America’s Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder today’s call is being recorded.
I would now like to hand it over to Virgin America’s Vice President of Brand Marketing and Communication, Abby Lunardini. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Abby Lunardini
Thank you, Danielle. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining today’s call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.

In terms of the format of today’s call, David will first deliver some opening remarks and commentary followed by Peter providing a full review of our results and current outlook. At the conclusion of these remarks we’ll open to Q&A from analysts on the phone. For those of you have not yet received a copy of today’s earnings press release please visit Virgin America’s Investor Relations site at ir.virginamerica.com.
At this time we wish to remind listeners that the company comments today will contain forward-looking statements that are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements made today may include among others references to future performance and any comment about our strategic plans.

These risks factors and others are more fully disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements are based on information available to us and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The company cautions users of this presentation not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which may be based on assumptions and events that do not materialize.
As this call will include references to non-GAAP results, excluding special items, please reference this morning’s press release on our Investor Relations website for further information regarding forward-looking statements and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to GAAP results.
With that I will now turn it over to David Cush.
David Cush
Thanks Abby. Good morning and thanks everyone for joining us on the line for our first earnings call as a public company. As most of you know our airline started about eight years ago with a handful of people who had a pretty radical idea and that was basically to create an airline that people love. At that time air travel, especially domestic air travel was a pretty dismal experience. It was something to be tolerated rather than to look forward to and we came out to try to change that. We also offered the industry a different business model, streamlined low cost production model similar to what the low cost carrier were running at the time. But a revenue model that was focused on higher yield in business travelers, basically similar to how legacy carriers produced their revenue.

The business model allows us to offer a premium brand product in major business markets where guests have historically [indiscernible] of the legacy services but to do with the lower cost structure than the big legacy airlines were doing at the time. And our revenue performance demonstrates our success as we continue to mature our markets and grow our loyal following of frequent fliers.
In 2014, we achieved record profitability and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With the completion of one of the more successful airline IPOs in history raising $357 million, we eliminated $690 million in debt from our balance sheet and increased our liquidity by $214 million. And we now have the right balance sheet for long-term growth and our balance sheet really has been a bit of anchor on the company up until this time and we’ve been freed from that anchor.
Both our existing and new shareholders share a lot of confidence in the low-cost, high-amenity business model. In 2014 we recorded non-GAAP net income of $84.4 million, excluding special items that Peter will get into later. Full year non-GAAP net income increased by $74.2 million over 2013 and it was the best year in our history.
RASM growth was 4.6% in 2014, the second highest in the domestic industry and on highly competitive routes. So if you look at our network we are in the most competitive routes in the country. We have fared very well. So you look at a long haul route like JFK-LAX arguably the most competitive route in the country we were number two in RASM in that market and that’s a highly competitive market with, I believe six competitors in it. You look at a short haul market like LAX-San Francisco, again a very dense market with lots of competitors we were also number two. So we've proven we can go on the most competitive markets and have excellent RASM performance and this really demonstrates how our product resonates with our guest and the fact that travelers are willing to pay a small premium for our unique service. 
In 2014, we continue to grow and optimize our network and position the company for long term success with our expansion to our first Mid-Continent focused city at Dallas Love Field and growth in the major business markets like New York, La Guardia and Washington DC, with new flights from La Guardia and an expanded presence at DC where we previously had one beyond perimeter flight into San Francisco. These were due to the acquisition of key airport assets in 2014 in conjunction with the U.S. airways American settlement. 
In New York we're now serving all three major airports and we've expanded our RASM opportunities with four code share and 32 interline partnerships in 2014 and this is becoming a more meaningful part of our revenue stream. Our new presence at Love Field allows us to bring out fair competition and to bring a different product to the market for business guests travelling from the airport that is the most convenient to downtown Dallas. We're the only carrier at Love Field to offer three beautifully designed classes of service, touch screen seat back entertainment, Wi-Fi power outlets on every flight and on demand food and drink for every guest on every flight. 
Also today we announced that we're launching new non-stop service between Dallas Love Field and Austin beginning on the 28th of April, so here in a couple of months with five flights a day. As you may know this is currently a monopoly route that has long suffered high fares. We're looking forward to stimulating the market by lowering fares as much as 30% to 40% and offering local travelers a high quality product and we think this is a market right for stimulation. We think there is a lot of dry traffic that would rather fly with the right prices in particular walk up pricing. 

The new route will complement our existing schedule and we'll also have pretty significant connecting opportunities from Love Field or over Love Field, I should say that brings our total schedule to 19 departures daily from our two gates and I think critically two of the markets we served out of DCA -- out of Love Field are DCA and La Guardia, both beyond perimeter to Austin. Austin does have one non-stop flight from Southwest but that makes those connecting markets and we think Love Field is going to be a good place to connect people. 
This year, we also continued to sweep the major travel awards with our consistent product and our top notch guest service including DNA Best Domestic Airline in both travel and leisure and Condé Nast Annual Surveys for the seventh consecutive year. We also maintained our focus on operational integrity. Once again we were ranked number one airline in the airline quality report, based on, on-time performance customer complaints and baggage. 
We continue to transform the traveler experience through our guest service and our innovative product. We were the first airline earlier I should say [ph] in 2014 to design its website with responsive design, basically meaning you get the same web experience regardless of which device you were using. 
In December 2014, we completed our installation to Gogo's faster next generation AGG 4 antennae. We were the first airline of course back in 2009 to have Wi-Fi in all of our airplanes. This is basically going and replacing it with the highest quality Wi-Fi and the most reliable Wi-Fi and that is really our commitment to our guests that we will remain on the cutting edge when it comes to Wi-Fi. 
We also launched a co-brand credit card program and continue to drive significant growth in our Elevate frequent flyer program. We grew by about 16% last year and we now have 3.4 million members. Just as importantly and I would say what is truly the core focus of our company is we've been able to do all of this while maintaining an efficient network in operation and maintaining one of the lowest CASMs in the industry and that's really what our focus has been, fourth quarter CASM increasing by about 0.7% due to our simple operating model.
Of course none of this would have been possible and the company itself would not be possible without the hard work of our 2,800 team mates and their dedication to creating a greater airline and focusing on our customer. 
Before I hand it over to Peter I do want to run through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter revenue performance and Peter will get more into these numbers. First of all, fourth quarter PRASM increased by 1.5% year-over-year which is slightly higher than our prior estimates. The load factor was up 2.7 points to 81.2 and yield declined by 1.8 point. So that’s the math behind those numbers. Capacity was essentially flat and we did have a longer stage length about at 1.8% longer stage length. Total RASM increased 3.7% due to increased strength from our co-branded credit card that was implemented in 2014 as well as some significant strength and I would say accelerating strength in other ancillary products. 
Most markets in the network performed well year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We do have a couple of pockets of weakness that we can address more fully if you would like. One is in the New York transcon market. It’s a highly competitive market and I think we all understand some of the disruption that’s going on with new products and more importantly new capacity that’s been introduced in the market. And the other one is Love Field which is going through quite a disruptive transition with tremendous additional capacity in what is mature market if you take the total, Dallas metro flights [ph] and just lots of moving pieces when you look at the competitive dynamic there. But again a market that we expect to be very robust but is going through what I would call a turbulent period right now.

As of now when we look forward to the first quarter 2015 even with those comments I just made, we do expect first quarter PRASM to be relatively flat and I think we are going out with guidance of between negative one and positive one in terms of PRASM year-over-year in the first quarter. At the same time we expect that we would continue to drive good results in 2015. We got markets that remain to be matured and we have got some other long-term cost advantages that will kick in even further. 
With that, I am going to turn it over to our CFO, Peter Hunt. He is going to discuss both the full year 2014 performance and our fourth quarter numbers in greater detail. 
Peter Hunt 
Thanks, David and good morning everyone. And before I run through all the details I did want to join David in thanking our team mates for another quarter of solid financial results and really just an exceptional 2014. I will start with a run through the fourth quarter. This morning Virgin America reported fourth quarter net income excluding special items of $28.1 million, which was a 98% increase in income from the fourth quarter of 2013. Improved RASM as David mentioned combined with relatively flat operating cost excluding special items drove a 45% increase in operating income to $34.2 million and our operating margin at 9.2% improved by 2.6 points year-over-year. 
As David mentioned total RASM increased 3.7% on a slight decline in capacity and on the cost side our total CASM, excluding special items increased 0.7%. If you exclude fuel and profit sharing from our total CASM, that CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing increased 4.2% year-over-year and that’s primarily from increases in salaries and benefits to our teammates as well as higher airport related cost due to new airports in the network and also higher revenue related costs that go along with higher RASM.
Our fuel cost, excluding special items decreased $8.7 million year-over-year and our average economic fuel cost per gallon during the quarter declined 8.9% to $2.87. This does include hedges that relate to the fourth quarter in those numbers, it also includes fuel related taxes which is about $0.18 a gallon for us. Our taxes are little bit higher than most other airlines just simply due to the nature of our network. 
And we estimate that we have about $30 million in losses associated with our fuel hedging program. Our program is designed to delay the impacts of changes in fuel price, so when we have rapidly declining fuel costs, as we did in the fourth quarter the impact of that will be delayed for us, so we will receive the benefits within three to six months after drops in fuel price. We estimate that for the quarter our price at spot prices would have been roughly $2.50 gallon to $2.55 a gallon versus the $2.87 that we recorded.
Our net interest expense declined $3.2 million in the quarter which is just 35% that’s primarily due to the completion of our initial public offering and all the related improvements that, that brought to our balance sheet. And our fourth quarter fully diluted earnings per share excluding special items was a $1.16 and that’s based on the weighted average share count of $23.7 million. This quarter is a little unusual because of the fact that we completed the initial public offering. 
We have a capital structure that was highly leveraged prior to the IPO with a very low share count and a capital structure post IPO with shares of over 44 million. So it’s a little unusual in the fourth quarter versus what we will expect going forward. And I know some of the analysts that are following us have prepared estimates assuming that the IPO occurred at the beginning of the quarter.
So we have also released a pro forma fully diluted earnings per share that reflects what we believe our EPS would have been if the IPO had occurred prior to the beginning of the quarter. And in that instance our pro forma interest expense would have been $3.5 million lower, resulting in net income of $31.6 million and our fully diluted earnings per share, excluding special items would have been $0.71 based on our $44.6 million fully diluted share count. 

As David mentioned earlier we did incur some special items during the fourth quarter, the bulk of which related to our IPO and all the information we just shared does exclude those special items. The total of those items was $24.2 million. $20.4 million of that number relates to items associated with initial public offering, the bulk of which is for salaries, wages and benefits, equity related compensation from our employee stock ownership plans as well as previous grants of equity to management that were contingent upon the IPO. 
We also had a $1 million of costs related to exiting Philadelphia and Dallas/Fort Worth. This is part of the network changes that David discussed earlier as well. These are costs associated with some small portions of leased space that we will no longer occupy now that we have left those airports. And then we also have $2.8 million related to fuel mark-to-market adjustments on hedges that relate to 2015 where we could not apply hedge accounting. We will include those costs in the appropriate quarters to which they relate as we report numbers in the first half of 2015. So on a GAAP basis if you include those special items our net income for the fourth quarter was $4.5 million. 
Now looking at the full year, which I am pleased to say marks Virgin America’s second consecutive full year profitability, our full year income improved from $10.1 million in 2013 to $84.4 million for the full year of 2014. We achieved this from solid RASM improvement, our RASM was up 4.6% year-over-year and as David mentioned also by continuing our focus on maintaining our competitive cost structure. Our CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing increased just 2.8% for the full year on flat capacity and our fuel cost declined 3.5% year-over-year. 
Restructuring of our balance sheet was a big contributor to the improvement in net income that we had in 2014. We cut our net interest expense in half to $35 million. And looking at the balance sheet we ended the year with $394.6 million in cash which is roughly 26.5% of our total 2014 revenue. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $101 million but that does include a $100 million that was related to our initial public offering and restructuring of our balance sheet where we had $100 million released from some of our credit card processes that we are holding that back. So excluding that item operating cash flow was roughly $1 million for the quarter. However we did have $13.5 million collateral posted related to fuel hedges which is bit of an unusual item. So adjusting for that more normalized basis our operating cash flow for the quarter would have been little under $15 million.
Our IPO did dramatically change our balance sheet. Our leverage has significantly declined as a result of the IPO. At September 30 we had total debt on our balance sheet of $805 million and we had a stockholders’ deficit at that time of $334 million. Now at year end we have a total debt outstanding balance of just $130 million and we have positive stockholders equity of $460 million. So major restructuring of the balance sheet by completing the initial public offering and the related changes to our balance sheet that came with that. 
And I will end with some commentary on our first quarter guidance that we also released this morning. We expect the first quarter 2015 capacity to increase between 2% and 3%. I will caution that there have been a number of storms, especially recently in the last week or two that have caused some cancellations and continued storms could change that estimate of capacity. Our first quarter PRASM we do expect to be between minus 1% and plus 1% year-over-year and our CASM excluding fuel and profit sharing we expect to increase between 1% and 3% versus the first quarter of 2014. 

We expect our realized economic fuel cost per gallon which will be inclusive of hedges and fuel related taxes to be between $2.45 and $2.55 a gallon. That’s based on current forward curves and that could also change as spot fuel prices change significantly before the end of the quarter. Our full year CASM guide remains between 4% and 6% year-over-year and that’s primarily a result of the recently announced changes to compensation that will bring most of our work groups close to industry average. This is a one-time increase. We don’t expect it’s larger than we would normally expect on annualized basis going forward, but it’s a reflection of our commitment to our teammates to strive for industry average compensation and by implementing the changes that we announced earlier this year in 2015, we will bring most of our team A groups up to -- very close to industry average. 
And just a few comments on our few hedging program as well. We do have a hedging program. We’ve had in place since 2012. As a smaller airline it’s important to have some protection, because fuel price is such a volatile expense and it is our largest expense. It’s weighted towards the next three to six months and it’s a constantly rolling program. So it simply delays the impact of changes in fuel price. So they are delayed when they rise, which is the point of the program and they are also delayed when they fall. So we’ll continue to see benefits of lower fuel prices in the second and third quarters of this year even if fuel prices change simply because of the program that we have in place.
And with that Danielle I’d like to turn it back to you to start our Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first call comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael Linenberg
Great. Hey, good morning David, Peter. I guess two questions here. The first is with the announcement of the Austin service, or the Austin Love Field service and you also look at some of the other new announcements over the past five, six months. What percent of your system is now in new markets or markets that have been in existence less than 12 months and maybe you can even give it to me on an ASM basis, because it does seem you have a decent amount of markets that have yet to mature?
David Cush
Yes, Mike. I would say that number’s somewhere between 12% and 15% if you take all of our capacity that is in markets that are new markets and including Love Field as a new market distinct from DFW.
Michael Linenberg
And then just back on the Love Field, were you ever given an opportunity to make a bid or at least respond to United’s two gates there or was that just done behind the scenes and do you find it somewhat surprising that there has been nary a response from the DOJ? I mean it just looked like that deal’s going to go through without any sort of pushback?
David Cush
Yes, Mike. We were aware there were discussions and we were aware that United was interested in moving those gates. That’s just kind of in the matter of course in the airline businesses as slots and gates become available and they are talks [ph] around that. We weren’t tremendously interested in the additional gates. We were satisfied with what we had. I think as far as a DOJ reaction, I guess the assumption there is between the competition we provide in critical markets out of Love Field as well as what America’s doing at DFW that the DOJ felt comfortable. And if you look at the pricing action the DFW pricing has somewhat mirrored what’s going on in Love Field. So I would say at least in the immediate short-term we’ve seen that the two airports are offsetting each other.
Michael Linenberg
Okay. Okay, that makes sense and thank you.

David Cush
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And your next call comes from David Fintzen from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Fintzen
Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Can we just sort of parse down a little bit what you’re seeing in New York on the Transcon particularly between -- A, sort of your front of the airplane premium product and more of the economy, but also between JFK and New York. I mean some of the product innovation and capacity in JFK is that affecting New York or are the two kind of operating separately?
David Cush
Well, JFK in New York, if you get too much of our pricing difference than you do create some preference there. But in general I think when pricing is the same the people have their own airplane preference, but you can move them from one airport to another, if there is a pricing distinction. So while New York isn’t necessarily on top of JFK pricing at all times, it has to be close, because otherwise you will have people either cross the Hudson or not cross the Hudson to get to JFK. 
As far as what we’re seeing in the market it’s really interesting. The market’s been disrupted quite a bit, I would say by the capacity that’s been added and part of that -- what is most visible of course is met [ph] but also just a number of seats that have come into the market that the market is up roughly 10% in terms of up capacity, away capacity away from us and that’s primarily being driven by Jet Blue capacity increases going from four a day, I believe last summer she planned eight a day in summer of 2015.
In addition, when we look at the fact that they have 16 first class seats or [indiscernible] seats on each airplane, that combination gives them about 17% of the premium seats in the JFK LAX market going from position of no seats. So what happened is you have got a tremendous amount of additional capacity coming on, in addition to the pricing actions that are that Jet Blue has taken that is public information and the continue prevalence of 599 in that market. So what we are seeing in the marketplace and what we are seeing with us is a pretty significant dilution in average fares, I would in the order of 30% to 40% on market average. But also a stimulation in traffic and this has impacted each airline differently of course. 
If you look at an American or a Delta for example what it is doing it is stimulating traffic which then displaces free upgrades. So for them it’s kind of interesting because they have got much more exposure to it because they have such large premium cabins. On the other hand they have some capability to react to it. If you look at the rationale [ph] on us we have a small cabin of eight seats. We have seen less of a fare impact but at the same time since we have also sold first class and we don’t upgrade we have less ability to go in and displace upgrades. So the markets are a little bit messy right now. I will say that as we look forward in our bookings things seem to be settling down, looking into March and April and so hopefully it is a powerful market that in the past has been able to absorb a lot of capacity and hopefully it will see a little bit more stability going forward.
David Fintzen
And you said less fare impact for you, does that also -- that your products even not having a [indiscernible] with the last not to have a [indiscernible] you don’t think your difference in product is a sort of disproportionately hurting you?
David Cush
We don’t -- again a part of it comes from having only eight seats, so that protects us somewhat with less supply out there. But we also believe that you know the smaller cap and the fact that it is a more controlled cabin with a dedicated lab [ph] and a dedicated flight attendant is something that’s appealing to people. You know a [indiscernible] see other than our red eye is probably important for an hour and half or two hours of the flight. The rest of the time what you want is a comfortable environment. So we have held on to your customers albeit at a lower fare because of the impact of that. And as of now we are sticking to our guns. 

David Fintzen
Okay, great. I appreciate all that color.
David Cush
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next caller comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Savanthi Syth
Hey, good morning. Just on the same topic I was wondering if you could provide a little more what you are seeing on in Dallas. I would have expected 1Q PRASM to be a little bit better maybe because of tougher easier comparisons. I am just wondering if Dallas is having more of an impact or if it’s transformed or how you look at it?
David Cush
Yeah, our primarily impact in the first quarter will be from Dallas. And if I can just give a little more color on this market, you know if you look at the Dallas marketplace in most of the most important markets capacity is up by 25% to 30%. So this is a massive increase in capacity and a massive dislocation in what arguably is a mature market. In some market such as in DCA you see capacity up 75%. So you got a situation there that is again somewhat disruptive. What we have seen out of that so far is fares much lower than anyone expected. Whoever thought he would be able to get double-digit fares into La Guardia and DCA, well you can right now. 
At the same time we have seen a lot of stimulation in the market. So we are only a few months into this. My strong gut feel is that this will work itself out pretty quickly also. It is a limited capacity airport. And that’s one of the reasons we went in to Austin is that we see the very strong airport presence for Love Field and we can see that in the numbers, that our direct booking numbers are higher than they have ever been. At the same time there are a couple of structural issues with Love Filed that will take some time to work out. The first one is awareness. You know for 40 years you couldn’t fly to these places out of Love Field and just reminding people that now you can. 
The second one I would say is there are some distribution challenges we have there in terms of city codes and -- that we’re working through. All of that being said we expect the challenges at Dallas to be fleeting for lack of a better term. We understand what they are and that’s why we’ve added these additional flights in Dallas because we’re very bullish on the market. 
Savanthi Syth
That’s very helpful, thanks. And then just on the ancillary revenue, great performance there. I know you’re lapping here the new credit card deal. How should we think about as you go forward here in 2015, are there any big items that could drive anci revenue?
David Cush
Yeah, without getting too far into it, we’re most excited about some additional automation that will be coming online, 3 Saber [ph] in the second quarter and in particular what we’re focused on is new system or new capability that’s called EMD, electronic miscellaneous document. And this allows us to go in and variably price different ancillary products, it allows us to go in and officially bundle ancillary products and perhaps just as importantly to offer these through all sales channels, including all the GDS’ So if you look at our capabilities right now and we did quite well in ancillary but our capabilities right now are pretty basic. 
We have a single price for our premium seats across all routes, all seats and that’s a pretty basic way of doing things. This will free us up to in and initially variably priced, to go in and charge different amounts on different seats on different stage lengths and different -- and then ultimately perhaps dynamically priced, so that as seats are taken out of the inventory that the remaining seats actually increase in price in a similar way a normal revenue management system works. 
So we are quite excited about the capabilities at haul and if you look at our fourth quarter ancillary revenue numbers as you can see there is a lot of momentum there and we think with the capabilities that we’re getting from Saber [ph] that certainly by the end of the second quarter we’re going to see some additional opportunities. 

Savanthi Syth
Okay, thanks. 
Operator 
Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And your next call comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. 
Hunter Keay
Hi good morning and thank you. Thanks for the color in this call this morning, it’s very helpful, I appreciate it. So there’s a lot of capacity in the Hawaiian market right now. It’s pretty clear that at all time highs and I'm wondering how that impacts your plans to use a number of the planes that you’re going to take later this year and next year into what is probably an oversupplied market and do you have any alternatives for growth if you guys decide that it’s unpalatable to dilute that market even further?
David Cush
Well we certainly have alternatives. We haven’t grown the airline in a few years, we are a bit starved for growth right now. We think there are a number of opportunities out there that we have not been able to take. I won’t get into them but if you look at it Hunter, it’s five airplanes this year and five airplanes next year, it’s not a lot of capacity we need to deploy. That being said we have seen growth in the Hawaii market in terms of capacity but our analysis right now shows that the market is absorbing that capacity quite efficiently and the revenue is growing in particular from the Bay Area, revenue is growing with that capacity. 
So we’re going to keep a close eye on it. We don’t need to make that decision today. We are preparing technically all of the things that we need to prepare in order to do that so that if we make that decision from a marketing standpoint and a network standpoint we’re prepared to operate it. But as of now we remain pretty bullish on the Hawaii market, particularly given our point of sales strength out of San Francisco. 
Hunter Keay
Got you, thanks. And that service would follow a sequel, that’s where you’re planning on starting that at some point commensurate with when you take delivery of these aircraft, I mean at this point of time is that generally the plan?
David Cush
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?
Hunter Keay
Yeah, so should we think about if you guys do decide to start that market, we should pretty much assume it’s going to start roughly in line with when you actually take delivery of the aircraft?
David Cush
I would say certainly it cannot start before, call it October. The first airplane we get into service would be in the late August and then of course we got -- even if we wanted to get in as quickly as possible you got test rounds and other things that need to happen. So I would say that’s the earliest it could possibly happen. 
Hunter Keay
Okay, great and then a question on the CASM ex guide, I appreciate you guys reiterating or updating the full year guide, I think you said four to six but as I look at the first quarter guide it looks pretty good with pretty light ASM growth. So if I am thinking about ASM growth coming in the back half of the year and the north of 5% range, does that -- is there some conservatism to this CASM ex-guide or am I just -- or is this just sort of the math of the way that the money is moving around between profit sharing and the wage line, is that just pretty much is what it is or you guys being maybe a little bit concerned about your thinking about that there are still some moving parts that you're not sure of at this point. 
David Cush
Well it is the math between profit sharing versus regular salaries, wages and benefits that was impacting that. It's also that the salary increases that we announced earlier don't actually -- they're not implemented until April 1. So we won't see a lot of impact from those year-over-year until the second quarter. So that's why you'll see the CASM will tick up in the second third and fourth quarters year-over-year because that's where it will have this big change associated with the underlying fixed component of salary, wages and benefits, that's the biggest reason. 

Hunter Keay
Okay great. Thanks. Appreciate it guys. 
David Cush
Thank you Hunter.
Peter Hunt
I think what -- I may want to give a little color on the changes we made to wages and in particular I think one thing that's been overlooked is the philosophical reason for our change in profit sharing that we went and created a threshold earnings per aircraft before profit sharing kicks on. And philosophically what we're trying to do is to go and say that not only do we need to be profitable but we need to achieve an acceptable return on invested capital on the assets we have before we start sharing what I would call excess profits with our team mates. So our team mates really understood that, that need to make sure the investors are all taken care of so the capital is available in the future as we need it and this was the right step forward structurally in order to do that. 
Operator
Thank you. And your next call comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. 
Daniel McKenzie
Yes, hey good morning guys. Thanks for the time here. Just I am wondering if you can help us understand the economic changes that are occurring in the Bay Area. It seems to me things are picking up and accelerating but I am wondering if you can just help add some color to what's going on there, how that is helping to drive demand that I think that Virgin is especially levered at San Francisco market as well as Los Angeles. And then essentially how that would tie to perhaps how seasonality might change for your airline as you look at this summer versus say past summers, just given what's happening economically today in San Francisco. 
David Cush
Well of course this area has had very strong growth for a number of years and doesn't seem to be slowing down and in some way seems to be accelerating. I think there is a good side and a bad side of that of course. The good side is there is a lot more business and a lot of good business and in particular corporate business where we've been quite successful in the corporate arena and especially successful with San Francisco-based companies. 
The flipside of course is that's one of the great things about our industry is, it is competitive because people move to where the money is. So we are seeing additional capacity coming into San Francisco we are seeing additional interest from the other carriers and that’s something that we're prepared to withstand but this industry doesn't, it doesn't operate and above when people see opportunities they go and try to take advantage of it. 
So from our perspective we're happy we're here. It’s been a good part of what's driven our company. We're happy that the revenue environment is strong and in particular with the firms that are growing here, they like our product because it resonates with kind of their demographic. So I am not sure I answered your question other than to say it's a vibrant market but one that also attracts a lot of competitors. 
Daniel McKenzie
Okay. That's it from me. Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of our call. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Abby Lunardini.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

Former American Airlines executive takes helm of Virgin America

Virgin America, the discount carrier that recently took up residence at San Francisco International Airport, has named an American Airlines executive as new its chief executive officer, succeeding Fred Reid, who was required to leave the company under the terms of the airline's contentious federal certification process.
C. David Cush, 47, whose last position at Fort Worth-based American Airlines was senior vice president of global sales, was selected by the Virgin America board of directors, which is chaired by Donald J. Carty, the former CEO of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines.

In an interview from his home in Dallas, Cush said, "It would take a unique opportunity to lure me away" from American Airlines, and he said he found that exact situation when he read the Virgin America business plan that vows to "put fun back in air travel."
"Where I believe this company wants to go is to predictability and efficiency on the ground and pleasant and fun in the air," Cush said. "We'll keep it very focused on the consumer. That has to be the central idea of anything the company does going forward."
At American Airlines, Cush was responsible for all sales and distribution activities worldwide. He also served as vice president of American's St. Louis hub, and, before that, he was vice president of international planning and global alliances.
Cush also held management positions in finance, sales and marketing, customer service and operations. In addition to his years at American Airlines, Cush served as chief operating officer of Aerolineas Argentinas, the national carrier of Argentina.
Virgin America, which launched in August at SFO, is the only California-based airline, and is headquartered in Burlingame. It has more than 800 employees, is operating 10 airplanes and has firm orders for 31 more, in the Airbus A320 family.
Reid, 57, the former president and chief operating officer of Delta Air Lines, was named chief executive officer on April 4, 2004, and steered the nascent operation through the fundraising and certification process.
Virgin America is a U.S.-owned and controlled company, but there was a perception of "foreign ownership" in part because the carrier licenses the Virgin brand from British-based Virgin Group, headed by Sir Richard Branson.
Competitors of Virgin America, a low-cost airline, tried to derail its certification application by challenging its claim that the Virgin Group is a minority share investor. Foreign citizens are barred from owning more than 25 percent of a U.S. airlines or exercising operational control.
Virgin America was certified, but the federal government said Reid would have to leave the company because of the original "foreign ownership" concerns.
Reid said he has no immediate plans. "That's a neat thing to say. I've never been able to say that," he said. "Maybe I'll find success at blueberry farming after all."
He said raising capital had been difficult and that certification, with more than 5,000 checklist items that had to be accomplished, was complex.
"Yes, it's very nice that we are able to license the Virgin brand, but that is a brand agreement. Everything else is sweat equity," Reid said. "Yes, we are proud to fly the Virgin flag, but it is worth nothing unless we perform here."
Cush was born and raised in Shreveport, La. He received a bachelor of fine arts degree in broadcast/film and a bachelor of science degree in psychology from Southern Methodist University, both in 1982. He received an master of business administration from the university a year later.
He assumes his new position Dec. 10.

Virgin America CEO David Cush at the launch ceremonies for its new flights to Toronto
 







In the midst of a very busy week launching his airline’s new service between SFO and Toronto, Virgin America CEO David Cush sat down for an email interview with The BAT. 
Check out what he has to say about flights to Chicago, Virgin’s appeal to business travelers, his vision for SFO’s Terminal 2, Virgin’s improving financial performance, and how its SFO market compares to its LAX market. 
The BAT: Why did Virgin pick Toronto as its next city instead of say, Chicago, which your business travel customers are really rooting for? Speaking of, will Virgin fly to Chicago any time soon? Is it still on your radar? Will you fly to Chicago this year?   
David Cush: We’re gearing up for major growth this year with expansion to five new destinations this year alone. [Cabo San Lucas and Cancun in Mexico, for example.] We have still been unable to come to a resolution with Chicago on gate space at that airport — but it remains high on our list and we hope to be able to enter O’Hare in 2011.  With little to no low fare competition from the West Coast to O-Hare, we’re still planning on entering the market and we know that consumers will benefit when we do with lower fares and better choices.  
The BAT: You’ve been in the news a lot this week with the new launch to Toronto. How did that go?
David Cush: Toronto is a world-class business and leisure destination so it has always been on our list, and of course the Virgin brand has deep roots there.  Toronto-Pearson airport welcomed us with open arms – but the O’Hare situation certainly accelerated our growth into Canada.
(For more frequent updates about Bay Area Travel, follow The BAT on Twitter!)
The BAT: What is Virgin’s business travel/leisure travel mix out of SFO? How difficult is it for Virgin to go up against United with its Mileage Plus program and multitude of nonstop flights? How would you gauge your success in convincing high mileage UAL flyers to give Virgin a try? Which airline at SFO would you say is your biggest competitor? 
David Cush: SFO is our home so we compete against everyone here, but we see our primary competitors as the legacy carriers on long-haul.  We have a pretty even mix of business and leisure travelers, but the trend we have seen is a lot more business travelers converting to us given our “office in the sky” features like Wi-Fi, power outlets, in-flight TV with live CNN, CNBC, and our premium cabins [First and Main Cabin Select services].  We’ve been pretty successful, because at the end of the day if you give people a better product at a great price– you are going to do well.  The other thing we have found is that once people try us, they tend to come back.  [Note: Virgin America now has nearly 1.5 million members in Elevate, its frequent flyer program.]  
The BAT: I recently made a video about SFO’s Terminal 2, which will be the home of Virgin America starting next spring. Can you give us a glimpse of what you envision for that space? What will make it uniquely Virgin? How much of a say do you have in the design of the space? Do you think upscale customers will complain about NOT being in the glam International terminal at SFO with access to the Virgin Atlantic lounge?  
David Cush:  The project was in our plans from pre-launch, given our growth trajectory.  We’ve had an opportunity to work with SFO and Gensler [the architect] to develop a design that captures the best parts of San Francisco and California: the use of new technology, a focus on innovative design and sustainable building practices.  Our goal has always been to reinvent the entire flight experience by harnessing the best in new design and technology — and creating an environment people actually want to stay in (so award-winning food, comfortable seating, cabin design, Wi-Fi).  T2 is doing the same on the airport level. There will be a lot of focus on design, there will be a “slow food” vendors on the concourse, preferential hybrid car parking — all those California cliches, but in a good way.  We’re also working to ensure that our space at T2 will be at least LEED gold certified — which will be a first.  
The BAT: How is Virgin America doing financially? Are you anywhere near profit yet? When do you expect the airline to be in the black? How has the recent news of recovery in the airline business translated for Virgin? Is the company on solid financial ground? What’s your expected load factor this summer? What are your best performing routes?
David Cush:  Even though we saw much higher fuel cost [related to hedging in the quarter]– we also reported record revenue performance — with a 46 percent jump in revenue year over year.  So, even with the near doubling of fuel, our top line progress continued to exceed our expectations and we remain on track for full year operating profit in 2010.  In line with the rest of the industry, we’re forecasting a very strong remainder of the year, with high loads throughout (summer is particularly strong), and we’re seeing great performance across the board.  The long-haul is really where our product stands out. For example, our Boston routes are very strong — and our tech-forward service seems to resonate with travelers there. [And they are bound to get even more biz on this route when American nixes SFO-BOS flights in November which we covered last week in The BAT.]
The BAT: LAX seems to be a really important market for Virgin and almost as big as SFO– I know that LAX now has 24 daily departures compared to SFO’s 31…that’s pretty close. Which is a better performing market for Virgin, SFO or LAX? How would you compare your customer base in LAX to SFO?  







David Cush: LA has and always will be a focus city for us and we will continue to grow there — it is a great market for us.  We are the only airline headquartered in California, SFO is our home and LAX will always be a major focus.  Our product and amenities resonates with LA travelers, and we see a lot of entertainment, media traffic along those routes (along with the high-tech business traffic out of SFO).

Topical Bible: CushBible > Topical > Cush◄ Cush ►Jump to: Hitchcock's • Smith's • ATS • ISBE • Easton's • Concordance • Thesaurus • Hebrew • Library • Subtopics • TermsHitchcock's Bible Names DictionaryCushCushan, Cushi, Ethiopians; blacknessSmith's Bible DictionaryCush(black), a Benjamite mentioned only in the title to (Psalms 7:1) He was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe. (B.C. 1061).ATS Bible DictionaryCush1. The eldest son of Ham, and father of Nimrod, Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha, most of whom settled in Arabia Felix, Genesis 10:6-8. 2. The countries peopled by the descendants of Cush, and generally called in the English Bible, Ethiopia, though not always. But under this name there seem to be included not less than three different countries: A. The oriental Cush, comprehending the regions of Persis, Chusistan, and Susiana, in Persia. It lay chiefly to the eastward of the Tigris. Hither we may refer the river Gihon, Genesis 2:13 Zephaniah 3:10. See EDEN. B. The Hebrews also, in the opinion of many, used Cush and Cushan, Habakkuk 3:7, to designate the southern parts of Arabia, and the coast of the Red sea. From this country originated Nimrod, who established himself in Mesopotamia, Genesis 10:8. The "Ethiopian woman," too, whom Moses married during the march of the Israelites through the desert, came probably from this Cush, Exodus 2:16-21 Numbers 12:1 2 Chronicles 21:16. C. But, more commonly, Cush signifies Ethiopia proper, lying south and southeast of Egypt, and now called Abyssinia, Isaiah 18:1 20:3-5 Jeremiah 13:23 Ezekiel 29:10 Daniel 11:43. Easton's Bible DictionaryBlack. (1.) A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod (Genesis 10:8; 1 Chronicles 1:10). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush (Genesis 2:13,  R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt (Ezek. 29:10,  A.V. "Ethiopia, " Hebrews Cush), with which it is generally associated (Psalm 68:31; Isaiah 18:1; Jeremiah 46:9,  etc.). It stands also associated with Elam (Isaiah 11:11), with Persia (Ezek. 38:5), and with the Sabeans (Isaiah 45:14). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; Comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia (Isaiah 18:1; Zephaniah 3:10,  Hebrews Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites "from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India." The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation.(2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of Psalm 7. "Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe, and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of 'rewarding evil to him that was at peace with him.'" International Standard Bible EncyclopediaCUSH (1)kush (kush):1. The Ancestor of Many Nations:(1) The first of the sons of Ham, from whom sprang Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabtecah. He was also the father of Nimrod, who rounded Babel (Babylon) and the other great states of Shinar or Babylonia (Genesis 10:6-8). The meaning of the name is uncertain.(2) The name of the country around which the Gihon flowed (Genesis 2:13), rendered "Ethiopia" in the King James Version, but in view of the distance of that country from the other rivers mentioned, this seems to be an unlikely identification.2.
