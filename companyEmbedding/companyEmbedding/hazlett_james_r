James Robert “Jim” Hazlett, 94, of Homewood, Illinois and formerly of Galion, Ohio died Friday, August 7, 2015 at The Villa, in South Holland, Illinois. Jim lived with his son and daughter-in-law for the 9 years previous to his death. Born September 9, 1920 in Mansfield, Ohio, he was the son of Floyd C. Hazlett (deceased 1924) and Lena Leone (Kling) Harnagel, and the step-son of Arthur T. Harnagel. For 63 years, he was the beloved husband of the late Ruth Maxine Raymond Hazlett whom he married on May 21, 1942. He was a member of Southview Baptist Church in Galion where he taught Sunday School and was very active in all aspects of his church. He was also a lifetime member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and enjoyed entertaining children of all ages with his table magic. In 1953 he and his wife started Galion Laundry Service. He later retired from Fisher Printing Company in Galion. Surviving are his one son and daughter-in-law, T. Jerry and Kathie Hazlett of Homewood, Ill.; five grandchildren, Toby Hazlett, Jerren Helwig, Aaron Hazlett, Adam Hazlett and Sara Bishop and 19 great grandchildren. A private memorial for family and caregivers was held on August 9 in Homewood. Another memorial service and internment will be at Mansfield Memorial Park in Ontario, Ohio at a later date to be announced.
