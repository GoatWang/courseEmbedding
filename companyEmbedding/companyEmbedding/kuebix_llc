HEAR IT FROM OUR CUSTOMERS

“Kuebix has been providing The Paper Store with logistics solutions since 2008. By combining its deep industry knowledge with a TMS that is able to scale and adapt with our needs, Kuebix has been able to deliver value year after year.”
Tom Anderson | The Paper Store
“H.C. Starck realized a 14% reduction in freight spend the first year we used Kuebix TMS. We’ve stayed with Kuebix over the years because of the continued savings combined with the company’s commitment to innovation and customer service.”
Mark Smolinsky | H.C. Starck Inc.
“It used to take me 30-plus minutes to process a shipment. With Kuebix, it takes less than 5 minutes. Now I simply plug my freight specs into Kuebix, and within seconds get back direct quotes from all of my freight carriers. Kuebix automatically generates a BOL, which I had to hand type in the past. Additionally, the labels that Kuebix produces have the PRO # on them making it so much easier for our warehouse. Overall, Kuebix is a huge time saver, and in business we all know that time is money!”
Anthony Buffo | Dine-Aglow Diablo
“Kuebix has become the foundation of our Managed Transportation Services program for all inbound shipments. Kuebix has provided Weis the necessary information for all stakeholders to operate at the highest level of efficiency. Kuebix Managed Services and proprietary programs have not only increased our service levels by generated revenue, which has ultimately reduced our costs. We’ve taken our supply chain to the next level of excellence with Kuebix Technology and Managed Services.”
Wayne Bailey | Weis
“By choosing Kuebix as our logistics provider, Ahold is  able to better meet our everyday challenges. The  grocery industry is extremely competitive and the  smallest of margins can have a huge impact on market  share. Kuebix provides full transparency between our buyers, vendors and transportation team. Kuebix comprehensive reporting capabilities help us control our analytics and now we can use on demand reporting to monitor crucial information, such as KPIs. Kuebix  Managed Services and Technology give us an edge  over our competition.”
Mark Donley | Ahold USA
“Kuebix is packed with features and we immediately realized savings through rate comparison and the ability to easily request spot quotes. We are now able to create numerous shipment reports including a quote report for accounts payable to quickly audit every invoice, and a carrier performance report that allows us to maintain superior customer satisfaction. With the combination of low cost and great features, Kuebix is a win for everybody.”
Mike Koehler | Polytek
“With Kuebix, we can quickly view all our carrier rates side by side and choose the best rate for our shipments. Kuebix is extremely easy to use and the customer support is exceptional.”
R.L. Bunting | Chesapeake Spice
“Kuebix takes the guesswork out of determining which carrier offers the best rate and shortest transit time for our shipments. We are saving a tremendous amount of time now that we can view all our rates in one place and no longer need to visit all the different carriers’ websites.”
Peter Frey | F&M Supply

HEAR IT FROM OUR CUSTOMERS

“Kuebix has been providing The Paper Store with logistics solutions since 2008. By combining its deep industry knowledge with a TMS that is able to scale and adapt with our needs, Kuebix has been able to deliver value year after year.”
Tom Anderson | The Paper Store
“H.C. Starck realized a 14% reduction in freight spend the first year we used Kuebix TMS. We’ve stayed with Kuebix over the years because of the continued savings combined with the company’s commitment to innovation and customer service.”
Mark Smolinsky | H.C. Starck Inc.
“It used to take me 30-plus minutes to process a shipment. With Kuebix, it takes less than 5 minutes. Now I simply plug my freight specs into Kuebix, and within seconds get back direct quotes from all of my freight carriers. Kuebix automatically generates a BOL, which I had to hand type in the past. Additionally, the labels that Kuebix produces have the PRO # on them making it so much easier for our warehouse. Overall, Kuebix is a huge time saver, and in business we all know that time is money!”
Anthony Buffo | Dine-Aglow Diablo
“Kuebix has become the foundation of our Managed Transportation Services program for all inbound shipments. Kuebix has provided Weis the necessary information for all stakeholders to operate at the highest level of efficiency. Kuebix Managed Services and proprietary programs have not only increased our service levels by generated revenue, which has ultimately reduced our costs. We’ve taken our supply chain to the next level of excellence with Kuebix Technology and Managed Services.”
Wayne Bailey | Weis
“By choosing Kuebix as our logistics provider, Ahold is  able to better meet our everyday challenges. The  grocery industry is extremely competitive and the  smallest of margins can have a huge impact on market  share. Kuebix provides full transparency between our buyers, vendors and transportation team. Kuebix comprehensive reporting capabilities help us control our analytics and now we can use on demand reporting to monitor crucial information, such as KPIs. Kuebix  Managed Services and Technology give us an edge  over our competition.”
Mark Donley | Ahold USA
“Kuebix is packed with features and we immediately realized savings through rate comparison and the ability to easily request spot quotes. We are now able to create numerous shipment reports including a quote report for accounts payable to quickly audit every invoice, and a carrier performance report that allows us to maintain superior customer satisfaction. With the combination of low cost and great features, Kuebix is a win for everybody.”
Mike Koehler | Polytek
“With Kuebix, we can quickly view all our carrier rates side by side and choose the best rate for our shipments. Kuebix is extremely easy to use and the customer support is exceptional.”
R.L. Bunting | Chesapeake Spice
“Kuebix takes the guesswork out of determining which carrier offers the best rate and shortest transit time for our shipments. We are saving a tremendous amount of time now that we can view all our rates in one place and no longer need to visit all the different carriers’ websites.”

“I am very excited about the opportunity to lead Kuebix through its next phase of accelerated growth. I am fortunate that Kuebix is already in a very unique position in the market with thousands of companies already using its products today,” commented Dave Lemont.  “Dan Clark and the team have built a platform from the inside out that truly understands the nuances and challenges of the freight industry from the customer’s point of view.
