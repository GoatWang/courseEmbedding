Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Biotech-Focused Star Hedge Fund Tang Capital's Q1 2012 Picks In Its $429 Million Portfolio | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Biotech-Focused Star Hedge Fund Tang Capital's Q1 2012 Picks In Its $429 Million PortfolioApr. 26, 2012  1:52 AM ET|| Includes: ACHN, ALXA, ANIP, BMY, GSK, MNKD, OGXI, OPTR, SLXP, SPPI, UTHRby: GuruFundPicksGuruFundPicks Consensus Picks DIY Tools, Top 20 Small-cap Newsletter, Trade Alert Service (Auto)GuruFundPicksSan Diego, CA-based Tang Capital Management, founded in 2002 by Kevin C. Tang is a hedge fund that specializes in the life sciences industry. Prior to founding his firm, Mr. Tang was most recently the Managing Director and head of Life Sciences research group at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown. As of the most recent filing for the March 2012 quarter, filed with the SEC last week, it held $429 million in 13-F assets. Between firm inception and through May, 2010, the firm had generated a total return of 520%, or 26% on an annualized basis, compared to the 5.3% average annual return for the S&P 500 over the same period.
We analyzed Tang's biotech holdings in its Q1 2012 13-F to determine its highest conviction bets, selecting the largest buys and sells in size, where the buy/sell is also a significant proportion of its prior quarter position in that company. Based on that analysis, the following are its high conviction bullish positions, that are also trading undervalued compared to the peers in their group (see Table):
Amylin Pharmaceuticals (AMLN): AMLN develops drugs for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and other diseases. Tang added a new $46 million position in Q1. Other leading institutions with large bullish bets on AMLN in Q4 (the most recent quarter for which most institutional filings are available) included mega fund T Rowe Price Associates, with $288 billion in 13-F assets, adding 2.8 million shares to its 1.0 million share prior quarter position, and hedge fund Kingdon Capital Management, with $1.86 billion in 13-F assets, adding a new 1.2 million share position.
AMLN shares have mounted a strong rally recently, up about 130% YTD, with the biggest surge occurring at the end of March after news broke that the company rejected a $3.5 billion unsolicited bid from Bristol-Myers Squib (NYSE:BMY), a move that effectively put a $22 floor under the stock. On Monday, the company announced that it had hired bankers and was actively looking to sell itself, with Astrazeneca Plc (NYSE:AZN), Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) mentioned as potential suitors, that could pay a premium to get access to its valuable BYETTA / BYDUREON diabetes portfolio. The street has been abuzz over the news, with some speculating that the company could ultimately go for as much as $31 a share, still well above Wednesday's closing price of $26.20.

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI): SPPI develops innovative therapies with a focus in the areas of hematology and oncology. Tang added a new $20 million position in Q1. Other leading institutions with large bullish bets on SPPI in Q4 (the most recent quarter for which most institutional filings are available) included mutual fund powerhouse Fidelity Investments, with $492 billion in 13-F assets, adding 2.9 million shares to its 1.9 million share prior quarter position, and New York-based biotech-focused hedge fund, Baker Bros. Advisors, with $3.0 billion in 13-F assets, adding a new 0.9 million share position.
SPPI shares have been weak since its announcement on April 5th that its phase 3 clinical trials in bladder cancer failed to meet the primary endpoint of statistically significant difference in the rate of tumor recurrence, the same day it also announced that it way buying Allos Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ALTH) for $1.82/share in cash. Its shares are now down about 25% YTD, after a blockbuster 2011 during which share prices more than doubled. Furthermore, in its most recent Q4, the company missed analyst earnings estimates (24c v/s 28c), while revenues came in-line; its shares currently trade at 20-21 forward P/E and 3.3 P/B compared to averages of 22.8 and 4.8 respectively for its peers in the drug manufacturers group; however, earnings are expected to drop from $1.25 in 2011 to 89c in 2012 and 53c in 2013.
Salix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SLXP): SLXP develops branded prescription drugs for the treatment of GI diseases. Tang added a new $15 million position in Q1. Other leading institutions with large bullish bets on SLXP in Q4 (the most recent quarter for which most institutional filings are available) included Pittsburgh, PA,-based mutual fund powerhouse Federated Investors, with $352 billion in assets under management, adding 1.5 million shares to its 0.2 million share prior quarter position, and legendary billionaire investor Ken Griffin's Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel adding a new 0.4 million share position. SLXP shares have performed well recently, almost doubling from the lows last September, and they currently trade at 16 forward P/E and 5.2 P/B compared to averages of 25.9 and 7.1 for its peers in the drug manufacturers group, while earnings are projected to increase slightly from $2.82 in 2011 to $3.05 in 2013.

The following are additional companies that Tang is bullish about, accumulating shares in them in Q1 2012 (see Table):

Oncogenex Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:OGXI), a biotech company engaged in the development of new cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients, in which it added a new $11 million position;
Alexza Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXA), a development stage biotech company, focused on the research, development and commercialization of a novel proprietary drug delivery system for the acute treatment of central nervous system conditions, in which it added a new $6 million position;
Mannkind Corp. (NASDAQ:MNKD), a developer of treatments for cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, with its lead product candidates the AFREZZA dry powder insulin formulation and its proprietary light, discrete and easy-to-use AFREZZA inhaler through which the powder is inhaled deep into the lungs, in which it added a new $6 million position;
Human Genome Sciences (HGSI), that develops gene-based protein and antibody drugs to treat such diseases as hepatitis C, lupus, anthrax, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV/AIDS, in which it added a new $2 million position; and
Biosante Pharmaceuticals (BPAX), that develops products for female sexual health and oncology, in which it added a new $2 million position.

The following are Tang's high conviction bearish picks, based on its Q1 2012 selling activity (see Table):

Optimer Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:OPTR), that focuses on discovery, development and commercialization of hospital specialty products such as products that treat gastrointestinal infections and related diseases, in which it cut out completely in Q1 2012 its $16 million prior quarter position;
United Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ:UTHR), a biotech company focused on developing therapies to treat cardiovascular, inflammatory and infectious diseases, in which it cut out completely in Q1 2012 its $4 million prior quarter position; and
Achillion Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:ACHN), a clinical-stage biotech focused on developing new treatments to patients with infectious diseases, including HCV and resistant bacterial infections, in which it cut $3 million in Q1 2012 from its $6 million prior quarter position.
