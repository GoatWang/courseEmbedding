Leonard Green was founded by Leonard I. Green in 1989 after separating from Gibbons, Green and van Amerongen Ltd. (Gibbons Green), a merchant bank which he had co-founded in 1969 with Edward I. Gibbons and Lewis W. van Amerongen. The firm's eponymous founder, Leonard I. Green died in 2002, leaving the firm to be run by John G. Danhakl, Peter J. Nolan and Jonathan D. Sokoloff (who had been Green's bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette prior to joining the firm).
The firm's predecessor, Gibbons Green had completed over 29 transactions with an aggregate purchase price of over $3.5 billion from 1969 through its dissolution in 1989 and was among the earliest practitioners of the leveraged buyout and management buyout. Among its most notable transactions were the purchase of Budget Rent a Car (1986) from Transamerica in 1986 as well as the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores. The firm completed the 1982 buyout of Purex Industries[20] but had to withdraw from the 1987 buyout of insurer Argonaut due to the stock market crash in that year.[21]
The dissolution of Gibbons Green and the formation of Leonard Green & Partners is primarily attributed to the failure of two buyouts: Ohio Mattress Company and Sheller-Globe Corporation.[22][23][24]

Ohio Mattress Company – On March 7, 1989, Ohio Mattress Company, known for its Sealy and Stearns & Foster brands, was sold to Gibbons Green for $1.1 billion, a price that many observers at the time believed too high. In August 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress. The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston’s equity capital and the bank was forced to seek a bailout from Credit Suisse, leading subsequently to the takeover of First Boston and the formation of CS First Boston.[25] The incident became known as "The Burning Bed"[26] and ultimately Gibbons Green was forced to offer a significant equity stake in the company in order to secure financing.
Sheller-Globe Corporation – Gibbons, Green bought Sheller-Globe jointly with United Technologies from Knoll International. When the company faced an immediate cash squeeze, United Technologies stepped in to buy out the shares owned by Gibbons Green. With no other options, Gibbons Green realized a $30 million loss on its investment. Gibbons Green accused Knoll of providing misleading or incomplete information, however observers believed the firm had not conducted proper due diligence.[23][27]

Leonard Green was founded by Leonard I. Green in 1989 after separating from Gibbons, Green and van Amerongen Ltd. (Gibbons Green), a merchant bank which he had co-founded in 1969 with Edward I. Gibbons and Lewis W. van Amerongen. The firm's eponymous founder, Leonard I. Green died in 2002, leaving the firm to be run by John G. Danhakl, Peter J. Nolan and Jonathan D. Sokoloff (who had been Green's bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette prior to joining the firm).
The firm's predecessor, Gibbons Green had completed over 29 transactions with an aggregate purchase price of over $3.5 billion from 1969 through its dissolution in 1989 and was among the earliest practitioners of the leveraged buyout and management buyout. Among its most notable transactions were the purchase of Budget Rent a Car (1986) from Transamerica in 1986 as well as the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores. The firm completed the 1982 buyout of Purex Industries[20] but had to withdraw from the 1987 buyout of insurer Argonaut due to the stock market crash in that year.[21]
The dissolution of Gibbons Green and the formation of Leonard Green & Partners is primarily attributed to the failure of two buyouts: Ohio Mattress Company and Sheller-Globe Corporation.[22][23][24]

Ohio Mattress Company – On March 7, 1989, Ohio Mattress Company, known for its Sealy and Stearns & Foster brands, was sold to Gibbons Green for $1.1 billion, a price that many observers at the time believed too high. In August 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress. The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston’s equity capital and the bank was forced to seek a bailout from Credit Suisse, leading subsequently to the takeover of First Boston and the formation of CS First Boston.[25] The incident became known as "The Burning Bed"[26] and ultimately Gibbons Green was forced to offer a significant equity stake in the company in order to secure financing.
Sheller-Globe Corporation – Gibbons, Green bought Sheller-Globe jointly with United Technologies from Knoll International. When the company faced an immediate cash squeeze, United Technologies stepped in to buy out the shares owned by Gibbons Green. With no other options, Gibbons Green realized a $30 million loss on its investment. Gibbons Green accused Knoll of providing misleading or incomplete information, however observers believed the firm had not conducted proper due diligence.[23][27]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Leonard Green was founded by Leonard I. Green in 1989 after separating from Gibbons, Green and van Amerongen Ltd. (Gibbons Green), a merchant bank which he had co-founded in 1969 with Edward I. Gibbons and Lewis W. van Amerongen. The firm's eponymous founder, Leonard I. Green died in 2002, leaving the firm to be run by John G. Danhakl, Peter J. Nolan and Jonathan D. Sokoloff (who had been Green's bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette prior to joining the firm).
The firm's predecessor, Gibbons Green had completed over 29 transactions with an aggregate purchase price of over $3.5 billion from 1969 through its dissolution in 1989 and was among the earliest practitioners of the leveraged buyout and management buyout. Among its most notable transactions were the purchase of Budget Rent a Car (1986) from Transamerica in 1986 as well as the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores. The firm completed the 1982 buyout of Purex Industries[20] but had to withdraw from the 1987 buyout of insurer Argonaut due to the stock market crash in that year.[21]
The dissolution of Gibbons Green and the formation of Leonard Green & Partners is primarily attributed to the failure of two buyouts: Ohio Mattress Company and Sheller-Globe Corporation.[22][23][24]

Ohio Mattress Company – On March 7, 1989, Ohio Mattress Company, known for its Sealy and Stearns & Foster brands, was sold to Gibbons Green for $1.1 billion, a price that many observers at the time believed too high. In August 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress. The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston’s equity capital and the bank was forced to seek a bailout from Credit Suisse, leading subsequently to the takeover of First Boston and the formation of CS First Boston.[25] The incident became known as "The Burning Bed"[26] and ultimately Gibbons Green was forced to offer a significant equity stake in the company in order to secure financing.
Sheller-Globe Corporation – Gibbons, Green bought Sheller-Globe jointly with United Technologies from Knoll International. When the company faced an immediate cash squeeze, United Technologies stepped in to buy out the shares owned by Gibbons Green. With no other options, Gibbons Green realized a $30 million loss on its investment. Gibbons Green accused Knoll of providing misleading or incomplete information, however observers believed the firm had not conducted proper due diligence.[23][27]

Leonard Green was founded by Leonard I. Green in 1989 after separating from Gibbons, Green and van Amerongen Ltd. (Gibbons Green), a merchant bank which he had co-founded in 1969 with Edward I. Gibbons and Lewis W. van Amerongen. The firm's eponymous founder, Leonard I. Green died in 2002, leaving the firm to be run by John G. Danhakl, Peter J. Nolan and Jonathan D. Sokoloff (who had been Green's bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette prior to joining the firm).
The firm's predecessor, Gibbons Green had completed over 29 transactions with an aggregate purchase price of over $3.5 billion from 1969 through its dissolution in 1989 and was among the earliest practitioners of the leveraged buyout and management buyout. Among its most notable transactions were the purchase of Budget Rent a Car (1986) from Transamerica in 1986 as well as the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores. The firm completed the 1982 buyout of Purex Industries[20] but had to withdraw from the 1987 buyout of insurer Argonaut due to the stock market crash in that year.[21]
The dissolution of Gibbons Green and the formation of Leonard Green & Partners is primarily attributed to the failure of two buyouts: Ohio Mattress Company and Sheller-Globe Corporation.[22][23][24]

Ohio Mattress Company – On March 7, 1989, Ohio Mattress Company, known for its Sealy and Stearns & Foster brands, was sold to Gibbons Green for $1.1 billion, a price that many observers at the time believed too high. In August 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress. The amount lent, $457 million, was 40 percent of First Boston’s equity capital and the bank was forced to seek a bailout from Credit Suisse, leading subsequently to the takeover of First Boston and the formation of CS First Boston.[25] The incident became known as "The Burning Bed"[26] and ultimately Gibbons Green was forced to offer a significant equity stake in the company in order to secure financing.
Sheller-Globe Corporation – Gibbons, Green bought Sheller-Globe jointly with United Technologies from Knoll International. When the company faced an immediate cash squeeze, United Technologies stepped in to buy out the shares owned by Gibbons Green. With no other options, Gibbons Green realized a $30 million loss on its investment. Gibbons Green accused Knoll of providing misleading or incomplete information, however observers believed the firm had not conducted proper due diligence.[23][27]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
