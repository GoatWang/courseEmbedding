Energy XXI reaches $1 billion with underwater pipeline sale

June 23, 2015





                                        Maureen McMullen | Energy Media Group					
Offshore oil and production company Energy XXI USA Inc., headquartered in Houston, recently sold its Grand Isle Gathering System (GIGS) for $245 million, bumping its total liquidation up to $1 Billion.
The company announced the sale of its GIGS to energy infrastructure real estate investment trust CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. today and expects to close the deal by the end of June.
CoEnergy, which focuses mainly on midstream and downstream assets, will assume ownership and the assumption of abandonment liabilities, but Energy XXI will still have access to the pipeline’s operations via a lease agreement with CoEnergy.
Energy XXI will collect revenue the pipeline generates via third-party transportation, as per the lease agreements with CoEnergy.
“The monetization of the GIGS pipeline assets is another important step in executing the strategy we communicated to our investors,” Energy XXI Chairman, President and CEO John Schiller said. “Continuing to maintain operatorship of the GIGS is important to us, ensuring transportation of a significant portion of our production.”
In related news, Mexico announces underwater gas pipeline to Texas.

                Energy XXI USA Inc. is selling its Grand Isle Gathering System to CorEnergy for $245… more 








 



Energy XXI USA Inc. (Nasdaq: EXXI), a Bermuda-based offshore oil company with its main office in Houston, announced it’s selling a subsea pipeline in a deal that brings its liquidity to nearly $1 billion.
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust Inc. (NYSE: CORR), a Missouri-based real estate investment trust that focuses on midstream and downstream assets, is purchasing the Grand Isle Gathering System for $245 million. The deal is expected to close June 30, according to the release.

Energy XXI will continue to operate the pipeline assets, including the Grand Isle terminal located on shore. Energy XXI will also retain any revenue generated by transporting third-party volumes, according to the release.




Cleveland-based KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. served as the financial adviser to Energy XXI in the sale. Houston-based law firm Vinson & Elkins also advised Energy XXI in the sale agreement.
The Grand Isle Gathering System is 153 miles long and in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2014, the pipeline transported enough oil to generate $486 million in annual revenue for Energy XXI, according to the company release. The pipeline transports represented around 42 percent of Energy XXI’s annual oil production for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014.
Energy XXI also took part in a mammoth deal in 2014 that made it the largest public independent oil producer in the Gulf. It acquired Houston-based EPL Oil & Gas Inc. (NYSE: EPL), including its debt, in a deal valued at $2.3 billion.
