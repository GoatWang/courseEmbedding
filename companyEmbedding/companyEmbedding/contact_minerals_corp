About Us


The Bonne Terre manufacturing facility was originally opened in 1927 as Valle Dolomite, a supplier of sintered stone for Granite City Steel.  As the company grew and expanded its product offerings to include refractory materials for the steel industry, the name was changed to Valley Minerals Products Corporation.  The ownership of the company changed many times from 1979 through 1996, at which time Vessell Mineral Products Corporation was formed to own and operate the facility.  In 2007 JOMICO, a company serving the steel industry with a range of commodity products, acquired Vessell Mineral Products Corporation.  The current owner, FTL Capital Partners LLC, acquired the company in September, 2010.
