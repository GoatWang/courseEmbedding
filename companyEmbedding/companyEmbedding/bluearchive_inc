Modular Panels are a hybrid of our Premade Panels and Site-fabricated System. The panels are built to their specified dimensions, cut down into sections and shipped.
These sections are installed together on a wall to create the panel with virtually no limitation on length.
Once the Modular Panel sections are installed, the Fabric can then be stretched across the panel and installed using the supplied fabric installation tool. The Modular Panel System makes panel sizes greater than 4′ x 8′ possible that are easy to install while greatly reducing shipping costs.


 

Key Features & Benefits

 



 Installation is Quick and Easy
Requires only a Power Drill & Level to Install
A 5' x 8' Panel can go up in 30 minutes

 Crush Proof Edges
Made from a High-Impact plastic
VOC Free; does not need chemical hardeners



 Significantly Reduces Maintenance Costs
Far more durable than a painted surface
Lasts for decades
Naturally Mitigates Visible Damage
Swapping out fabrics is quick and easy

Modular Panels are a hybrid of our Premade Panels and Site-fabricated System. The panels are built to their specified dimensions, cut down into sections and shipped.
These sections are installed together on a wall to create the panel with virtually no limitation on length.
Once the Modular Panel sections are installed, the Fabric can then be stretched across the panel and installed using the supplied fabric installation tool. The Modular Panel System makes panel sizes greater than 4′ x 8′ possible that are easy to install while greatly reducing shipping costs.


 

Key Features & Benefits

 



 Installation is Quick and Easy
Requires only a Power Drill & Level to Install
A 5' x 8' Panel can go up in 30 minutes

 Crush Proof Edges
Made from a High-Impact plastic
VOC Free; does not need chemical hardeners



 Significantly Reduces Maintenance Costs
Far more durable than a painted surface
Lasts for decades
Naturally Mitigates Visible Damage
Swapping out fabrics is quick and easy

Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
