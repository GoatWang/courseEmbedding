ALL ABOUT US
NEW GLOBAL ENGERY 




 ABOUT NGE 



 New Global Energy Inc. is a public company (symbol: NGEY) is traded on the OTCQB, focused on aquaculture (fish farming), agriculture (moringa) and the health and wellness Industry. The Company’s core business is the production of sustainably raised fish and moringa, on farms located in Southern California’s prolific Coachella Valley located just 150 miles from downtown Los Angeles. 






 AQUACULTURE 



 New Global Energy, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Aqua Farming Tech, is at the forefront of developing and implementing the most advanced, sustainable methods of producing seafood; its operations are conducted on 120 acres of Company owned farms located just east of Palm Springs in the heart of the prolific Coachella Valley, California. Aquaculture operations primarily produce tilapia for delivery to the Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco markets. 






 AGRICULTURE 



 NGE is targeting acquisition of additional farmland that will provide current income as well as the other benefits of hard assets including capital appreciation, an inflation hedge and favorable diversification. NGE’s management believes that farmland will benefit from the increase in demand for grain, plus environmental pressures for alternative energy and the impact of globalization. 






 HEALTH + WELLNESS 



 NGE is pursuing several new projects in the Health and Wellness area.  At the center are the company's nutraceutical offerings featuring the amazing Moringa tree. 






 FOR INVESTORS 



 New Global Energy, Inc. (OTCQB: NGEY), a public company focused on Aqua-Farming, Agriculture, and Health & Wellness, has had a busy month since our last shareholder letter. This week we launched a new website (www.newglobalenergy.net) featuring a bi-monthly Fish & Farm Report that tracks trends in various regions of the world, including the growth of sustainable seafood, consumer health and agriculture.

New Global Energy, Inc. Releases Q2 2016 Shareholder Letter

July 07, 2016 11:24

THERMAL, California, July 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --New Global Energy, Inc. (OTCBB: NGEY), a public company focused on Aqua-Farming, Agriculture, and Health & Wellness, released a shareholder letter for the second quarter of 2016 as an update on company developments and how they project to impact revenue growth and profitability.Our Tilapia areHuge Tilapia season is in full swing and our market size tilapia now weigh in at an average of 1.5 lbs. each. This impressive weight is made possible by our farm's warm climate, ample fresh water, improved brood stock, and proprietary fish feeding methodology that includes our fish being fed nutrient rich algae which is a primary food source in their natural environment.  We believe that the size and color of our fish far surpass the competition and we are proud to have a strong and steady supply of approximately 4 million fish projected to produce an on-going revenue stream. It is also interesting to note that because our farms are located in California we enjoy a competitive advantage since other seafood companies are forbidden by law from bringing live tilapia into or out of the state.  We are pursuing our marketing program of delivering direct to market which has the dual benefit of being able to absorb the margin allocable to the fish broker and delivering direct also allows us to amplify our brand message to our buyers of premium quality and product purity.To further expand our tilapia operation, we are investigating ways to boost distribution such as a possible partnership with Amazon Marketplace to provide market to market delivery.We have learned that certain demographic markets prefer whole fish versus filets and we will continue to take that into consideration as we ramp up distribution. We remain committed to becoming non-GMO certified, which is better for the land, the environment, animals and people and which commands price premiums and marketing benefits. We are presently pursuing the Certification process.We are extremely pleased that the Coachella Valley Water District has approved the Thermal farm to receive canal water, which comes from the rapidly flowing Colorado River and contains more oxygen and minerals than well water. Construction of the new extension should be commenced soon that will make it possible for canal water to reach the Thermal farm; estimated completion of the project is 2-3 years. The land value of the farm is expected to significantly increase upon project completion.    
The Moringa"Superfood" Opportunity We recently announced a joint venture agreement with the world's largest Moringa farm located in Leon, Nicaragua, which is a 180-acre farm growing nutrient rich Moringa. We are preparing for the launch of Moringa Reserve, LLC to develop, operate, distribute and sell Moringa-based "superfood" products to U.S. retail markets. Development of branding and packaging is underway.This new partnership is exciting because it provides us with enough Moringa to meet the demand of the orders that we anticipate for future distribution. The Nicaragua farm utilizes the best possible production methods and the owners have 20+ years of Moringa experience that has resulted in high quality product. The farm's land is extremely fertile and from volcanic origin and the fields are fertilized from compost made from the stems and trunks of the Moringa tree. The Moringa is all natural and organically grown without any chemicals.In addition to retailing Moringa-based superfood products, we believe that Moringa can generate several additional significant revenue streams for the Company including Moringa based animal feed products and Moringa oil to be sold to the cosmetics industry.Stock Price Considerations Several of our shareholders have expressed concern about the price per share, which has fallen from recent highs.  The Company continues to expand and improve its operations and technology providing what we believe is a strong base for significant growth. We have had some administrative delays due to changes in accounting treatments which have been reflected in our financial statements. We are making efforts to continue to build our accounting resources to help address the ever increasing complexity of the SEC reporting process.A new $3.5 million 506c equity financing for New Global Energy has just recently begun through our investment banker. This $3.5 million cash infusion will support farm and operational improvements, product development and market expansion as well as provide additional working capital necessary to aggressively pursue its business plan.We remain confident that we will experience upward stock appreciation as the public continues to understand and follow New Global Energy.For additional details, please follow our filings and press releases. We also send out a newsletter so include a mailing address and an email on our website contact page at http://www.newglobalenergy.net and we will add you to the distribution list.Sincerely,Perry D.

THERMAL, California, May 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
New Global Energy, Inc. (OTCQB: NGEY) ("the Company"), a public company focused on Aqua-Farming, Agriculture, and Health & Wellness, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the launch of Moringa Reserve, LLC to develop, operate, distribute and sell Moringa-based products to U.S. retail markets.
Moringa Reserve, LLC will be operated as a joint venture between New Global Energy and Moringa Energy, LLC, whose principals are the owners of the world's largest Moringa farm located in Leon, Nicaragua. The 180-acre farm is a leading source of nutrient rich Moringa and will ensure that Moringa Reserve has access to the finest quality Moringa in sufficient supply to meet demand. The companies signed a definitive operating agreement and production is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017.
"Our Moringa is all natural and organically grown without any chemicals on extremely fertile land from volcanic origin. We also don't use Gama-irradiation, which destroys many of the nutrients in the leaves. We do not use binding agents, fillers or laboratory-made synthetic chemicals that our bodies can't absorb and can have negative side effects. No artificial sweeteners, MSG or gluten are found any of our products," said Moringa Energy Founder Jacobo Arguello.
"We are pleased to finalize our joint venture and are confident that we will have enough Moringa to meet future demand. The U.S. market is now more receptive than ever to new Moringa products. It is considered the most nutrient rich plant on earth with over 92 nutrients and can radically benefit one's overall health in literally hundreds of ways," said Chief Executive Officer Perry D. West.
New Global Energy is already a leader in Moringa and uses it as a key component of the proprietary fish feed formula that is one of the cornerstones of the company's sustainable fish farming operation. In response to growing consumer demand for healthy seafood, New Global's fish formula is free of GMOs, antibiotics and chemicals and includes an optimized blend of Moringa, nutrient rich algae and a proprietary blend of other ingredients.

Tilapia Production Fully Underway at New Global Energy, Inc.






Mar 10, 2016, 11:19am EST














THERMAL, Calif., March 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- New Global Energy, Inc. (OTCQB: NGEY) ("the Company"), a public company focused on Aqua-Farming, Agriculture, and Health & Wellness, announced today that its tilapia season is in full swing and on schedule to produce record breaking revenue.

At Aqua Farming Tech, NGE's wholly owned subsidiary, there are two spawning seasons in the Spring and Fall that produce one million tilapia each that we expect to be a total of two million annually. This month, the Fall season's tilapia are coming to full maturity at approximately one pound each and are preparing to go to market at $3.60 per pound (delivered) or $3.00 per pound (picked up at the farm) with price increases expected. 
"We are very pleased that our tilapia farm operation in the Coachella Valley is more profitable and sustainable than ever before," said Chief Executive Officer Perry D. West. "As soon as our tilapia reach full market size we are ready to ramp up sales in order to meet increased consumer demand for quality seafood. 2016 will be a record year for our farms." 
New Global Energy's farms are uniquely suited to grow tilapia, which is a tropical fish, because of the area's warm climate and the availability of warm fresh water from geo-thermally heated wells.  The company's proprietary fish feeding methodology saves up to 70% on overall feed costs. The fish are fed nutrient rich algae and other aquatic plants for their first four months in grow-out ponds that represent a natural environment.

THERMAL, California, March 2, 2016

THERMAL, California, March 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
New Global Energy, Inc. (OTCQB: NGEY) ("the Company"), a public company focused on Aqua-Farming, Agriculture, and Health & Wellness, announced today that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 600,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
"At the current valuation, we believe the repurchase of our stock is a good use of funds that will reduce our public float by about 25% and demonstrate our commitment to enhanced long-term shareholder value," said Chief Executive Officer Perry D. West. "The shares will be purchased from time to time in the open market and the timing of purchases will be based on the stock price and other market factors."
In recent months, the Company has reported on new developments related to a new line of Moringa capsules. The Company plans to introduce specially branded line of Moringa capsules to its line of nutraceutical products, which will include drinks, tea, energy bars and other items to be sold through existing distribution contracts and to larger retail markets. Additionally, New Global Energy launched the tilapia spawning season at its farm in California's Coachella Valley with a record number of fish. New financing commitments from outside investors mean 2016 should prove to be record setting in terms of the number of sustainable fish grown and ultimately sold on the company's farm.

How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors…
























 
































HOME


























How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors… 

By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTSIt can light and heat your home…
Run factories…
Propel space ships…
It can even power the ENTIRE U.S. electrical grid…
Even tech giants like Google are getting in early to related technologies – they’ve invested $1.8 billion into solar and wind power systems that simply will not work when it’s cloudy or not windy…
 
That is, without the use of this fuel.
And Apple is investing nearly $1 billion in the same thing!
Everywhere you look, America’s biggest companies are investing in systems that will be compatible with this fuel including:

Facebook
Amazon
AT&T
General Motors
Costco
Target

The list goes on.
But to truly reap the benefits and rewards of investing in OBL, you must act quickly to stake your claim before the mainstream media blows this story open and ordinary investors become privy to this opportunity. 
Historically, those who invested early in new energy sources made fortunes that allowed them total financial freedom.
Looking back, according to our estimates…

A $100 investment in Standard Oil would now be worth $153,285…
A $1,000 investment would be worth $1.5 million…
A $10,000 investment would be worth $15.3 million…

We are talking about staggering generational wealth, the kind that could make your family mega-rich today – and keep it that way 100 years from now.
And it all starts with ONE COMPANY at the heart of this massive shift.
Even if you only start with a few dollars, that’s fine. As you saw, even a thousand bucks could make you a fortune.
With an opportunity like this – pure ground floor – it doesn’t always matter how much you put in… what matters is that you get in early.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
