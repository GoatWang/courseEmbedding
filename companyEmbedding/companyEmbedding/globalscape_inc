Learn More About Automation and Efficiency







 




Protocols
Protocols allow for easy sharing of information and resources over the Internet. No matter which operating system your employees, vendors, and partners are using, EFT is a managed file transfer platform that can communicate with them over common, industry-standard protocols, including FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, AS2, and SFTP. The client, not the server, drives the authentication process, so choose the protocols that connecting clients need to connect.

Security
Protect your data, protect your network. Left unprotected, data at rest or in transit can be a huge risk for a breach. Data encryption, secure protocols, strong ciphers, encryption keys, and password policies all support managed file transfer security so that you’re better equipped to safeguard sensitive information and avoid data breaches.

Learn More about Security







 




Compliance
Organizations that struggle to meet government and industry regulated compliance mandates risk heavy fines — and even worse — they risk reputation-damaging data breaches. Through a secure file transfer solution, meeting and maintaining compliance is easier to achieve.

Learn More About Compliance

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

These products assist businesses and individuals safely access and share, store and edit sensitive information internally and externally over Internet, Intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN) private and public communication networks by secure protocols, multiple platforms, encryption and two-factor authentication, including corporate, partner and financial data, medical records, and customer information.

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

These products assist businesses and individuals safely access and share, store and edit sensitive information internally and externally over Internet, Intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN) private and public communication networks by secure protocols, multiple platforms, encryption and two-factor authentication, including corporate, partner and financial data, medical records, and customer information.

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

Company Receives Two Network Products Guide 2017 IT World Awards






June 29, 2017 06:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GlobalSCAPE, 
      Inc. (NYSE MKT: GSB), 
      a worldwide leader in the secure movement and integration of data, 
      announced that Network 
      Products Guide, the industry's leading technology research and 
      advisory guide, has recognized the Company as a 2017 IT World Award Gold 
      and Silver winner.
    


      Globalscape’s distinguished product achievements have been recognized in 
      two categories, including:
    


Governance, Risk and Compliance (Gold Winner) – Enhanced 
        File TransferTM (EFTTM) offers extensive 
        security features that go beyond the mandated protocols and most 
        rigorous industry regulations such as PCI DSS, FIPS 140-2 validation, 
        HIPAA, HITECH, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and others. The platform provides 
        the ability to track and audit user activity or file movement while 
        also monitoring and alerting any potential violations of security 
        standards.
      

Cloud Security (Silver Winner) – EFT 
        Cloud ServicesSM brings together the security of 
        on-premises file transfer with the flexibility of the cloud for a 
        secure and scalable cloud data exchange infrastructure. Built-in 
        regulatory compliance, governance and visibility controls keep your 
        data safe, while leveraging a hybrid cloud or virtual environment and 
        works with top hosting providers.
      


      Now in its 12th year, the annual IT World Awards recognition 
      program encompasses the world’s best in every area of information 
      technology, including organizational performance, products and services, 
      hot technologies, executive and management teams, successful 
      deployments, product management and engineering, and customer 
      satisfaction.
    

      Award winners from all over the world were honored on Monday, June 26, 
      2017 during the 2017 SVUS Red Carpet Awards Ceremony Dinner in San 
      Francisco.

The company's products are part of the managed file transfer (MFT),[4] information security (InfoSec), enterprise mobility management (EMM),[5] and identity access management (IAM) categories, on which IDC, Gartner and Aberdeen Group have published reports.[6][7][8][9] Globalscape is member since 2007 of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which publishes the PCI Data Security Standards, the last of which is PCI DSS 3.0.[10]
These products assist businesses and individuals safely access and share, store and edit sensitive information internally and externally over Internet, Intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN) private and public communication networks by secure protocols, multiple platforms, encryption and two-factor authentication, including corporate, partner and financial data, medical records, and customer information.

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

The company's products are part of the managed file transfer (MFT),[4] information security (InfoSec), enterprise mobility management (EMM),[5] and identity access management (IAM) categories, on which IDC, Gartner and Aberdeen Group have published reports.[6][7][8][9] Globalscape is member since 2007 of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which publishes the PCI Data Security Standards, the last of which is PCI DSS 3.0.[10]
These products assist businesses and individuals safely access and share, store and edit sensitive information internally and externally over Internet, Intranet, wide area network (WAN), local area network (LAN) private and public communication networks by secure protocols, multiple platforms, encryption and two-factor authentication, including corporate, partner and financial data, medical records, and customer information.

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]

History[edit]
Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). Globalscape is perhaps best known for its software - CuteFTP,[14] which was its original product in 1996, is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms which continues today, and which now includes an integration with the company's latest innovation - Tappin - a mobility solution software.[15][16][17] The product helped the company gain notability among consumer audiences in the early years. The company has since diversified its offering to include secure information exchange solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. Today, approximately 80% of the company’s revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.[18]
The Tappin technology, with support for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices, has also been integrated into the company's EFT solution as the Mobile Transfer Client. In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.
Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and re-seller market.[19][20][21][22][23][24]
On May 16, 2016 James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately.[25]
Partnerships[edit]
Globalscape entered into a partnership with Seagate to utilize Tappin as the mobility solution on several different network attached storage lines[26][27][28][29][30] of theirs white-labeled as Seagate Global Access.[31] Other TappIn partners in the NAS industry include Toshiba,[32] QNAP[33] and Scale Computing.[34] Tappin also entered into partnership with antivirus maker ESET, to provide secure remote access to their client base,[35] and with Rackspace, to make it easier for Tappin users to connect to data kept in the cloud.[36]
Globalscape entered into a partnership agreement with Rackspace,[37][38] also based in San Antonio, to provide cloud-based secure managed file transfer.
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2006, Globalscape purchased Andover, Massachusetts-based Availl Inc.,[39] whose file collaboration and data protection software is now known as WAFS, or Wide Area File Services.[40]
In 2011, Globalscape purchased TappIn, a Seattle-based startup company formerly known as HomePipe Networks for $17 million.[41]
