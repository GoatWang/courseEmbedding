Investment Management
Cowen had $10.7 billion in assets under management as of April 1, 2017. We offer innovative products and solutions across the liquidity spectrum to institutional and private clients.








We attract talented investment teams as partners, providing seed and working capital and a robust institutional infrastructure to build sustainable investment businesses. Over decades, Cowen’s leadership has proven its ability to utilize balance sheet capital to build, grow and accelerate investment businesses that meet the changing needs of our clients.
The founding managing members of the investment management division (Peter Cohen, Thomas Strauss, Jeff Solomon, and the late Morgan Stark) have extensive experience derived from prior positions at the most senior levels in global capital markets and investment management.


We have an established network of relationships within the global financial community, as well as a seasoned perspective on the disciplines required to manage successful investment programs. In addition, we have assembled a professional support staff with their own extensive experience within their disciplines.
The founding managing members and senior-level professionals have collectively made significant personal investments in both the investment management division and, alongside Cowen’s clients, in most of the various portfolio strategies.
