Myovant Sciences Appoints Terrie Curran to Board of Directors




BASEL, Switzerland, Nov. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Myovant Sciences, Ltd. (NYSE: MYOV), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for women's health diseases and other endocrine-related disorders, has expanded its Board of Directors through the appointment of Terrie Curran as an independent director.Ms. Curran is the President of Worldwide Markets for the Inflammation & Immunology portfolio at Celgene Corporation and previously served as Senior Vice President and General Manager of Women's Health and Endocrinology at Merck & Co., Inc. Ms. Curran earned her Bachelor of Science and Graduate Diploma of Marketing degrees from the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia."We are pleased to welcome Terrie to our board and look forward to her counsel," said Lynn Seely, President and CEO of Myovant Sciences. "Her experience commercializing novel therapies in endocrinology and women's health will prove invaluable as Myovant moves forward with the development of relugolix and our other pipeline candidates.""I am excited to be involved with Myovant and anticipate working very closely with Lynn and the rest of her team in the years to come," said Ms. Curran. "Myovant is focusing its energies on therapeutic areas that I care very deeply about. These are areas that have not received the attention they deserve, and I share Myovant's commitment to rapidly bringing new therapies to market in order to improve the lives of patients and their families."About Myovant Sciences Myovant Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for women's health diseases and other endocrine-related disorders. Myovant's lead product candidate is relugolix, an oral once-daily small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. Myovant intends to initiate three multinational Phase 3 clinical programs for relugolix, one in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, a second in women with endometriosis-associated pain, and a third in men with advanced prostate cancer. Myovant is simultaneously developing RVT-602, an analog of kisspeptin, for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. Over time, the company intends to expand its development pipeline to include other potential treatments for endocrine-related disorders.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Myovant's ability to advance the clinical development of its lead product candidate, relugolix, into Phase 3 clinical development in multiple indications and expand its development pipeline.  Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to risks associated with the success, cost, and timing of the company's product development activities and clinical trials. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties affecting Myovant, see Myovant's publicly available filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its initial public offering Prospectus dated October 26, 2016. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Myovant as of the date of this press release and speak only as of the date of this release. Myovant disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law.Media Contact: Julie Normart W2O Group jnormart@w2ogroup.com  415.946.1087Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161011/427661LOGOTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/myovant-sciences-appoints-terrie-curran-to-board-of-directors-300364058.htmlSOURCE  Myovant Sciences, Ltd.
