Corporate History






For over two and a half decades, Dale Scott & Company has served California’s school districts and community college districts. Today, it is consistently one of the top innovators among California’s independent financial advisory firms. DS&C is registered as a Municipal Advisor both with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).
Innovation. DS&C has built a statewide reputation for solid, practical advice combined with a history of client-driven innovations. The financing solutions and products developed by DS&C have repeatedly become the standard for the state’s public finance industry.
Experience. DS&C offers clients a broad array of financing techniques and products. Over the past 25 years, the firm has served as financial advisor on hundreds of transactions in every corner of the state. In 1994, DS&C began to offer clients election advisory services for general obligation bonds. Today, we are among the leading election consultants in the state, having won over $10 billion in successful bond elections.
Independence. During this time, we’ve built a reputation for developing financing solutions that allow clients to meet their goals while still protecting taxpayers.

Financial Advisory






An Independent, Strategic Approach to Raising Funds in the Capital Markets
Experience. DS&C guides clients through the decisions, alternatives and risks they face when entering the capital markets. Having completed over 1,000 financings, DS&C brings an in-depth understanding of all phases of the debt issuance process including quantitative structuring, credit analysis and final pricing.
A Belief in Competition. Through either a formal competitive bid or direct negotiations with underwriters, DS&C is strongly committed to providing clients with the lowest cost of funding.
Politically Grounded. Behind every public-sector financing lies the need for political action. DS&C takes the time to understand a client’s internal dynamics and community profile so that the decision to move forward with a project is transparent in execution and strategically aligned with the organization’s goals.
