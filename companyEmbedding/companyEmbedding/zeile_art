Oversized Fee - This icon indicates that this item can only ship by truck freight because of its size and weight. Your order will have a surcharge of  $5.00  FYI: Please consider the freight truck to be an 18 wheeler. If you live on a cul-de-sac or another area that is not easily accessible by a truck this size, you may want to find an alternate shipping location. Items that are shipped by freight often are done due to weight or an awkward size that does not make it convenient to lift as a single person, the shipping company will call ahead to schedule delivery, please arrange to have assistance (like a neighbor, a friend or someone with a strong back) available to move it inside.
