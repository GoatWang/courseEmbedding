IRVING, Texas, March 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- USMD Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:   USMD), a physician-led integrated healthcare system, announces that Michael W. Bukosky has been appointed chief operating officer (COO) of USMD Holdings, Inc. As COO, Bukosky will oversee the daily operations of USMD therapeutic, diagnostic and centralized services. This includes hospital services, cancer treatment centers, clinical and pathology labs, imaging, human resources, contracting, revenue cycle, marketing and communications and IT. 
Bukosky will retain his position as president of USMD Physician Practice Management, in which he oversees operations of USMD's Physician Practice Management group, comprising nearly 50 clinics and more than 250 physicians and associate practitioners. 
"Mike has been with USMD since early 2014 and has brought tremendous operational leadership and expertise to our organization since that time," said John House, M.D., chairman, chief executive officer and president of USMD Holdings. "I am pleased that Mike will assume the position of COO of USMD. I look forward to Mike's continual guidance and leadership in his new role as we maintain our position to provide world-class, cost-effective patient care to the communities across DFW that we serve."
Prior to joining USMD, Bukosky served as chief executive officer of University of Louisville Physicians in Louisville, Ky., the largest, multi-specialty physician practice group in Louisville. University of Louisville Physicians has more than 78 subspecialties and more than 600 primary care and specialty physicians who staff more than 110 locations throughout Kentucky and Indiana and practice in all hospital systems in Louisville and Southern Indiana. During his time at University of Louisville Physicians, Bukosky led implementation and management of the new, integrated practice group, oversaw integration of the nearly 25 individual clinical practices into a unified group and developed the new organizational, management and operations structure of the organization. 
Prior to his time with University of Louisville Physicians, Bukosky was executive vice president and chief administrative officer of Carle Clinic Association in Urbana, Ill., where he oversaw operational leadership and financial performance of the entire system, including 10 outpatient locations and one hospital. He also has more than 20 years of experience working in administration at Scott and White in Temple, Texas, including serving as the organization's executive director where he oversaw operations for the entire system, consisting of more than 500 physicians, 60 clinical specialties, 20 clinic locations and one hospital.
Bukosky is active in the American Medical Group Association (AMGA), a trade association representing medical groups, health systems and other organized systems of care, including some of the nation's largest, most prestigious integrated delivery systems. AMGA represents more than 160,000 physicians, providing healthcare services to more than 120 million patients. Bukosky has been involved with AMGA since 2002. He has served as a board member since 2005 and served as the organization's chairman of the board, secretary and treasurer. He is also actively involved with the Public Policy Committee, which represents more than 140,000 physicians nationally in matters of governmental policy. Bukosky was also invited to attend the 10th and 11th annual World Executive Forum. This invitation-only event draws together healthcare leaders and executives from across the globe to discuss healthcare industry best practices, trends and insights.
Bukosky received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Accounting from Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and his Master's degree in Healthcare Administration from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. He has nearly 40 years of experience in hospital and clinic and physician group administration and operations.

Company description: The nonprofit corporation was created in 2011, with the goal of bringing 25 individual physician practice groups into a single entity in 2012. It will have about 1,800 employees, including 600 physicians.
Years serving the local health care industry: About two




Highlight of past year: Bukosky was instrumental in ULP’s formation. “By bringing the physicians of the U of L School of Medicine together into a single clinical practice, we are creating a dynamic organization that will empower our physicians to better serve all of our partner hospitals, as well as streamline a continuum of care for our patients. Our new organization will serve as a flagship in Louisville health care, enticing top doctors from around the world to practice medicine in our community.”
Biggest challenge for 2012: “To earn the trust of our faculty and staff as we align the medical group into a unified digital practice management system, a unified electronic medical records system and the development of a standardized process for our patients,” Bukosky said.
Biggest concern about health care reform: How each state will deal with payment for the uninsured.
Next major health care issue: Bukosky said paying for health care “was and always will be a challenge.”
Most memorable job experience: In his first few months in his new role, Bukosky said, “the highly talented group of faculty chairs at the University of Louisville School of Medicine committed to me and themselves that we will come together as one for the betterment of the patients we serve and the university we represent.”
Hometown: Nanticoke, Pa.
Interests: Racquetball, golf, bowling




 


How he keeps in shape: Running, playing racquetball, working out
Unhealthy habit he would like to kick: Eating Jif peanut butter, white bread and whole milk.
