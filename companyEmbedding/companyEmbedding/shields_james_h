Jim Patterson is a founding partner of Patterson Thuente IP. In his 30-plus years of experience, Jim’s practice has encompassed all aspects of intellectual property law, including patent prosecution, licensing, dispute mediation, and litigation. A recognized leader in the legal community, Jim works with mid-size and large, regional technology companies, as well as Fortune Global 500 corporations, providing them with senior-level strategic counsel and ensuring that their patent dollars are spent wisely. His work for clients, both domestic and international includes:

Overview
We live in a world where devices that emit harmful EMF’s (Electromagnetic Fields) are all around us – think computers, cell phones, microwaves and more. The Cation Shield™ helps strengthen your body’s bio-field while bathing you with the beneficial effects of negative ions that help combat EMFs by transmuting dangerous positive ions into beneficial negative ions. All you have to do is attach one to any electronic device and start enjoying the protection of the amazing Cation Shield today!





This is a multiple product testimonial. I’ve had a bad back and hips almost all of my life. After being introduced to the Juuva products, the Anion Emitter and Cation Shields, I have had a major transformation. I wear an emitter on each hip every day and I also have a Cation Shield in each shoe. The emitters help to relieve the inflammation in my hips and legs. About 4 years ago I was told I had nerve damage in my feet. I would get a tingling feeling, especially after being on my feet all day. After putting the Cation Shields in my shoes the pain/tingling feeling has gone away. They have been life savers for me.
Chris WLayton UT, USA



















I have an unusual application for the Cation Shield.  I have a lot of pain in my right knee. I placed four Cation Shields in a knee brace around my knee cap.  After two weeks the pain in my knee has greatly decreased and I barely notice it.  I wear the knee brace 24/7 and the Cation Shields have made a huge difference in the pain I feel.
Ron N

















Recently I had a bad fall twisting my ankle severely.  I learned from an acupuncturist master at the Vision event how to use the Cation Shields on the injury with surgical tape. My extremely painful injury immobilized me but within one hour of applying 3 Cation Shields, almost beyond belief, the pain and lace of flexibility was gone!  Thank you Juuva for such amazing products that really work!  Thank you Summit for Vision & great events with powerful speakers, doctors, and scientists where we are able to learn skills and information that allows us to grow and transform our lives, our very futures.
Michelle SHurricane, UT



















I deal with frequent headaches. Several of the Juuva products have helped me live with this pain. Here is how:

 On my sunglasses I have put 2 Cation Shields on the ear pieces so they are right next to my temples. When a headache happens I will wear my sunglasses and can feel the effects of the Negative Ions from the Shields.
Then with the aid of “The Handbook” by Dr. Frank Yurasek and the Anion Emitter, I can reduce the intensity of the headache. Both the Anion Emitter and the Cation Shields do not make the headaches go away but they do help make the pain become a more manageable pain. This allows me to go about my daily schedule (work, family, church, and Juuva appointments).
One of the side effects that I have with these headaches  is my energy is drained. Because of ReJuv and Zing, I can regain enough energy to maintain my busy schedule.
Many people say that headaches happen because you are not hydrated enough. To ensure that my hydration levels are not the cause of these headaches I drink my Energy Water, whether I use the Energy Pitcher or the Energy Cup or the Allwater drops.

Austin CHerriman, UT



















Distributor since December 21, 2014.  2 years 2 months, have not been sick since enrolling in Juuva. My cholesterol down to normal, walk farther and faster with cation shields in shoes.  Add Live and Zing for Bud’s Cocktail.  All products are great for a young 82-year-old.
James HSanta Clara, UT



















I have joint pain for over 27 years. My right knee started to hurt as I would kneel. I put four cation shields in a simple knee brace and wore it every day. The pain in my knee decreased significantly over three weeks where I could final kneel with very little pain. The shields helped reduce the inflammation that had developed in my knee.
Ronald NCedar Hills, Utah



















I enjoy the protection of the cation shield as I ride the BART train during commute hours and everyone has their electronic devices on. I wear the shield on a charm bracelet so I have some protection whether I have my cell phone or not.
Darvette A.Manteca CA



















I have planter fasciitis.  By placing several Cation Shields on the instep of my shoes I find a huge amount of relief from the pain.
Dr. Mike K.Portland ME



















Prepping for the St. George Marathon I was running my last long run.  It was 4:30 in the morning.  I was on mile 12 out of 20 when I hit uneven ground.  I fell and twisted my ankle.  Being out of town and by myself I ended the last 12 miles hobbling back to the car on a twisted ankle.  With the marathon just 3 weeks away I was devastated.  I had spent 7 months training for this. After meeting with a physical therapist, he encouraged me to not run on it.  I decided to put Cation Shields in my shoes. Within a week my ankle was almost fully healed. By the time of the marathon it was as good as new.  I kept the Cation Shield in my shoes, an Anion Emitter on each hip, Rejuv, Zing, Live and Alkaline water in my system.  I ran that race and beat my previous marathon time by 47 minutes.  I believe without the Cation Shields in my shoes I would not have healed as quickly.
Megan D.St. George UT



















Protection for Body and Mind
We all want to live a healthier, happier, longer and more vibrant life. Unfortunately, it is growing more and more difficult to meet that objective. With all of the technological advances over the past century we are literally creating interference that threaten our health and well-being.
That’s why Juuva believes in the overwhelming benefits of the Cation Shield. This shield was developed with proprietary, advanced technology and contains unique stones and minerals to help protect you from the harmful effects of your electronic devices.*
The stones within the Cation Shield emit negative ions, which provide numerous health benefits.*
Healing Properties Negative Ions:
Recovery from physical exhaustion or fatigue – by increasing oxygen levels in the blood and facilitating more efficient oxygen utilization, negative ions help accelerate recovery from fatigue.*
Stabilizing brain function – by promoting abundant oxygen levels in the blood, negative ions help normalize brain function, resulting in relaxation and calmness.*
Increasing metabolism – by stimulating the exchange of electronic substances in cell walls, negative ions help increase metabolism.
Strengthening the immune system – high levels of negative ions promote production of globulin in the blood, resulting in stronger resistance to illness.*
Balancing the autonomic nervous system – negative ions can calm and relax taut nerves by balancing the opposing sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system.*
Promoting better digestion – by counteracting over-arousal of the sympathetic nervous system, negative ions help ease tension in the stomach and intestines, promoting the production of digestive enzymes and enhancing digestion.*
Cell rejuvenation – negative ions help revitalize cell metabolism, enhancing the vitality of muscle tissue and strengthening internal organs.*

I have joint pain for over 27 years. My right knee started to hurt as I would kneel. I put four cation shields in a simple knee brace and wore it every day. The pain in my knee decreased significantly over three weeks where I could final kneel with very little pain. The shields helped reduce the inflammation that had developed in my knee.

Prepping for the St. George Marathon I was running my last long run.  It was 4:30 in the morning.  I was on mile 12 out of 20 when I hit uneven ground.  I fell and twisted my ankle.  Being out of town and by myself I ended the last 12 miles hobbling back to the car on a twisted ankle.  With the marathon just 3 weeks away I was devastated.  I had spent 7 months training for this. After meeting with a physical therapist, he encouraged me to not run on it.  I decided to put Cation Shields in my shoes. Within a week my ankle was almost fully healed. By the time of the marathon it was as good as new.  I kept the Cation Shield in my shoes, an Anion Emitter on each hip, Rejuv, Zing, Live and Alkaline water in my system.  I ran that race and beat my previous marathon time by 47 minutes.  I believe without the Cation Shields in my shoes I would not have healed as quickly.

Defense Against the Elements
Ions are invisible particles, either molecules or atoms, which bear an electric charge. Atoms, for instance, consist of an atomic nucleus that contains neutral neutrons and positively charged protons, as well as orbiting electrons that are negatively charged. When an atom is in a neutral condition, the number of protons (+) and electrons (-) is equal. When the number of protons and electrons is not the same, the particle becomes an ion that is either positively or negatively charged. Generally speaking, positive ions are harmful to the human body, while negative ions are beneficial .

Positive Ion: an atom (or molecule) that has lost one or more electrons due to a high-energy impact. Natural forces that generate positive ions include the decay of radioactive minerals, radon gas, forest fires, lightning and ultraviolet rays.


Negative Ion: an atom (or molecule) that has gained one or more extra negatively charged electrons. Negative ions are naturally generated by evaporating water.


Positive and negative ions also exist in our bodies, and the ratio of ions in the air we breathe influences the ratio in our bodies. Ions enter the body through the lungs (inhalation) as well as through the skin – especially through meridian (acupressure) points, which have weak electronic resistance. They then travel through the blood and lymphatic systems to cells throughout the body. Wearing Juuva Enerceutical products may increase the number of negative ions absorbed through the skin.
Negative and Positive Ion Levels Measured in Various Locations

(These measurements were taken in Japan)
Inside typical Tokyo residences, positive ions were found to be 500 times more numerous than negative ions. These findings may be due to inadequate ventilation both in office buildings and energy-efficient houses, as well as from the use of electronic devices that generate electromagnetic fields and from building materials that emit formaldehyde and other toxic fumes. On the other hand, high negative ion levels, such as at waterfalls, hot springs and other highly moist areas, will neutralize positive ions, leading to very low positive ion levels.
These measurements suggest that it is difficult to maintain sufficient levels of negative ions in the present age.

The Cation Shield contains a proprietary combination of precious stones and minerals, each with unique abilities to consistently target and emit healing properties.
Anion: is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged).*
Germanium: Germanium is a semiconductor element. Germanium has a small band gap that allows it to efficiently respond to infrared light. The two important characteristics of Germanium that brings about healthy function effects are its natural ability to balance the body’s ions (bioelectricity) and the penetration of Far Infrared Rays into the human body. Germanium is a chemical element in the carbon group of metalloids. High in antiviral activity, it acts as a powerful antioxidant.
Far Infrared Rays: Far Infrared Rays are invisible waves of energy that have the ability to penetrate all layers of the human physical body, penetrating into the inner-most regions of the tissues, muscles and bone. Far Infrared therapy involves the use of Far Infrared rays to gently heal, soothe, stimulate and detox the physical body, as well as the mind.
Scalar Energy: Scalar energy can regenerate and repair itself indefinitely. This also has important implications for the body. Once the charge is implanted, it remains in place with the regular ingestion of charged products. Scalar energy is also more field like than wavelike. Instead of running along wires or shooting out in beams, it tends to “fill” its environment. This becomes very important in terms of developing the technology for embedding products with scalar energy.*
Zero-Point Energy: Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have; it is the energy of its ground state. All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state and have an associated zero-point energy, a consequence of their wave-like interaction.*
Zeolites: Zeolites are microporous minerals that form where volcanic rocks and ash layers react with alkaline groundwater. Zeolite-based oxygen concentrator systems are widely used to produce medical-grade oxygen. The zeolite is used as a molecular sieve to create purified oxygen from air using its ability to trap impurities, in a process involving the adsorption of nitrogen, leaving highly purified oxygen and up to 5% argon. Zeolites are also widely used in industry for water purification.*
Tourmaline: Tourmaline is a healing stone known to aid in relieving stress, increasing mental alertness, improve circulation, and strengthen the immune system. It is a powerful agent for reducing toxin-related ailments. It is one of few minerals that emit negative ions and far infrared rays.*

Frequently Asked Questions
Can the Cation Shield be moved and used on a different electrical device after it has been installed on the initial device? ie: If I purchase a new cell phone can the shield be effectively transferred from the old phone to the new one?
The Cation Shield is a round patch. You peel the paper covering from the adhesive on the back and stick the patch on your phone or appliance. You may have to apply some additional adhesive (not included) if you move the patch to another device but, when care is used, the patch will not be harmed by transferring it as desired.

This is a multiple product testimonial. I’ve had a bad back and hips almost all of my life. After being introduced to the Juuva products, the Anion Emitter and Cation Shields, I have had a major transformation. I wear an emitter on each hip every day and I also have a Cation Shield in each shoe. The emitters help to relieve the inflammation in my hips and legs. About 4 years ago I was told I had nerve damage in my feet. I would get a tingling feeling, especially after being on my feet all day. After putting the Cation Shields in my shoes the pain/tingling feeling has gone away. They have been life savers for me.
Chris WLayton UT, USA



















I have an unusual application for the Cation Shield.  I have a lot of pain in my right knee. I placed four Cation Shields in a knee brace around my knee cap.  After two weeks the pain in my knee has greatly decreased and I barely notice it.  I wear the knee brace 24/7 and the Cation Shields have made a huge difference in the pain I feel.
Ron N

















Recently I had a bad fall twisting my ankle severely.  I learned from an acupuncturist master at the Vision event how to use the Cation Shields on the injury with surgical tape. My extremely painful injury immobilized me but within one hour of applying 3 Cation Shields, almost beyond belief, the pain and lace of flexibility was gone!  Thank you Juuva for such amazing products that really work!  Thank you Summit for Vision & great events with powerful speakers, doctors, and scientists where we are able to learn skills and information that allows us to grow and transform our lives, our very futures.
Michelle SHurricane, UT



















I deal with frequent headaches. Several of the Juuva products have helped me live with this pain. Here is how:

 On my sunglasses I have put 2 Cation Shields on the ear pieces so they are right next to my temples. When a headache happens I will wear my sunglasses and can feel the effects of the Negative Ions from the Shields.
Then with the aid of “The Handbook” by Dr. Frank Yurasek and the Anion Emitter, I can reduce the intensity of the headache. Both the Anion Emitter and the Cation Shields do not make the headaches go away but they do help make the pain become a more manageable pain. This allows me to go about my daily schedule (work, family, church, and Juuva appointments).
One of the side effects that I have with these headaches  is my energy is drained. Because of ReJuv and Zing, I can regain enough energy to maintain my busy schedule.
Many people say that headaches happen because you are not hydrated enough. To ensure that my hydration levels are not the cause of these headaches I drink my Energy Water, whether I use the Energy Pitcher or the Energy Cup or the Allwater drops.

 James H. Shields. Photo courtesy: Bob RedingSHIELDS, James H. (Frankfort, Pike Co., MO, May 8, 1842--Dubuque, IA, Sept. 30, 1914). Both of Shields parents lived in Dubuque before his birth. His father had been a state senator from the county and was prominent in business. James Shields and his parents return to Dubuque shortly after he was born. He attended Alfred University in Alleghany, New York for two years and then Union College in Schenectady, New York. He studied law with former Senator Henderson of Missouri before joining the Iowa bar in 1863. (1) Shields served as attorney for the DUBUQUE HARBOR COMPANY and, beginning in 1863, was also a director of the company. When he campaigned for the office of City Attorney, Shields received the unique approval of being elected to the position by both parties without opposition. He served three terms.
Shields had four years of legal experience as district attorney for the Tenth Judicial District. In 1889 he headed the Iowa delegation to the Democratic convention that nominated Grover Cleveland as president. (2)
Shields had many business interests in Dubuque. He was a director and stockholder in the BANK AND INSURANCE BUILDING, Citizen's Bank, and the DUBUQUE FIRE AND MARINE INSURANCE COMPANY. He was also considered the builder of the M.M. Walker and SCHROEDER-KLEINE GROCER COMPANY buildings. president of the DUBUQUE TRAVELING AND BUSINESS MEN'S ASSOCIATION, an organization composed of jobbers, manufacturers, real estate owners and capitalists of Dubuque.
