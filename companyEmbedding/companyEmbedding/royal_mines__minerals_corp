EXTRACTING GOLD FROM FLY-ASH - ROYAL MINES & MINERALS CHOLLA PROCESS
 Since September 2010 RMMC has been laboratory and pilot testing the Cholla process.  Independent bench scale tests have validated that we are exposing recoverable gold using our process.  We have run over 50 tons of coal fly ash to date.  We have experienced in-house values ranging from traces of gold to multiple ounces of gold per ton.  We can reproduce metal in hand process tests which we are scaling up.   Our team possesses the technical and engineering expertise to execute RMMCâs business objectives. We intend to work with strategic partners to scale up the Cholla process and expand production to multiple locations.

EXTRACTING GOLD FROM FLY-ASH - ROYAL MINES & MINERALS CHOLLA PROCESS
 Since September 2010 RMMC has been laboratory and pilot testing the Cholla process.  Independent bench scale tests have validated that we are exposing recoverable gold using our process.  We have run over 50 tons of coal fly ash to date.  We have experienced in-house values ranging from traces of gold to multiple ounces of gold per ton.  We can reproduce metal in hand process tests which we are scaling up.   Our team possesses the technical and engineering expertise to execute RMMCâs business objectives. We intend to work with strategic partners to scale up the Cholla process and expand production to multiple locations.

Revenues

During the years ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, we earned no revenues. We are
currently in the exploration stage of our business. We can provide no assurances
that we will be able to develop a commercially viable process or earn
significant revenue from the processing of fly ash or other materials.
Operating Expenses
The major components of our operating expenses for the years ended April 30,
2017 and 2016 are outlined in the table below:


                                                                             Percentage

Total operating expenses             $        878,333$        748,292       17.4%


Our operating expenses for the year ended April 30, 2017 increased as compared
to the year ended April 30, 2016. The increase in our operating expenses
primarily relates to the recording of losses from our entry into a joint venture
settlement agreement. This is partially offset by a decrease in mineral
exploration and evaluation expenses, and a other than temporary loss of
marketable securities in the prior year.
Mineral exploration and evaluation expenses primarily consist of rent,
consulting fees and labor expenses in our Scottsdale Facility.
Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: (i) monthly
consulting fees paid to our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Mitchell; (ii) legal
and audit fees in connection with meeting our reporting requirements under the
Exchange Act and (iii) travel expenses for our executives and directors.


                                       9


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than temporary loss on marketable securities relates to the impairment
losses recognized for the continued decline in stock price of our Gainey Capital
Corp shares.
Loss on marketable securities on joint venture settlement and loss on joint
venture settlement relates to our entry into an amended and restated loan and
joint venture agreement (the "Amendment Agreement") with GJS Capital Corp. (the
"Creditor") and Gregg Sedun (the "Consultant"). The Amendment Agreement replaces
in its entirety the original loan and joint venture agreement (the "Original
Agreement") dated April 16, 2014, between the Creditor and us. Under the terms
of the Amendment Agreement, the Creditor has agreed to extend the previously
advanced $150,000 Convertible Loan (the "Principal"). The loan bears interest at
a rate of 6% per annum, compounded annually and is due on demand. We settled
$329,000 in joint venture contributed capital in exchange for 15,065,570 shares
of our common stock. Also, we transferred, 1,400,000 of our 1,600,000 common
shares of Gainey Capital Corp. to the Creditor. The Creditor represented that it
was not a "US Person" as that term is defined by Regulation S of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended.
Gain on sale of marketable securities relates to the sale of shares of Gainey
Capital Corp. that were held by the Company.
We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we
implement our plan of operation for our Scottsdale Facility.

As at April 30, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $1,621,888 as compared
to a working capital deficit of $2,206,781 as at our year ended April 30, 2016.
The decrease in our working capital deficit is primarily due to $1,149,000 of
convertible loans payable-related parties reclassified to non-current
liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable-related parties
and accrued interest-related parties.
Financing Requirements
Currently, we do not have sufficient financial resources to complete our plan of
operation for the next twelve months. As such, our ability to complete our plan
of operation is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing in the
near term.
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order
to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will
result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we
will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt
or other financing to fund our planned mining, development, and exploration
activities.


                                       10


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to
stockholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
We have identified certain accounting policies, described below, that are most
important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of
operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our
audited financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. By their nature, these
estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on the financial
statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be significant.
Significant areas requiring estimates and assumptions include the valuation of
stock-based compensation, impairment analysis of long-lived assets, and
realizability of deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those
estimates
Research and Development - All research and development expenditures are
expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is principally provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are
generally 3 to 10 years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to
expense as incurred. Expenditures for property betterments and renewals are
capitalized. Upon sale or other disposition of a depreciable asset, cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in operating expenses.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - We review and evaluate long-lived assets for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment
consideration under ASC 360-10-35-17, Measurement of an Impairment Loss, if
events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be
recoverable.
Stock-Based Compensation - We account for share-based payments in accordance
with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the
award. In accordance with ASC 718-10-30-9, Measurement Objective - Fair Value at
Grant Date, we estimate the fair value of the award using a valuation technique.
For this purpose, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We believe this
model provides the best estimate of fair value due to its ability to incorporate
inputs that change over time, such as volatility and interest rates, and to
allow for actual exercise behavior of option holders. Compensation cost is
recognized over the requisite service period which is generally equal to the
vesting period. Upon exercise, shares issued will be newly issued shares from
authorized common stock.
ASC 505, "Compensation-Stock Compensation", establishes standards for the
accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
to non-employees for goods or services. Under this transition method, stock
compensation expense includes compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation awards granted on or after January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505.
