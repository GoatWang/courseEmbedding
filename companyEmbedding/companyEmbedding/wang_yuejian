Prospective, controlled clinical study. Fifty-three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (106 ears). Twenty-five patients (50 ears) received radiotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone for 14 days, and another 28 patients (56 ears) received radiotherapy alone. Pure tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) results were reviewed before and 1 year after radiotherapy. One year after radiotherapy, the air-and-bone conduction pure tone hearing thresholds increased, and the DPOAE levels decreased in the control group. There was no difference in the ABR wave I, III, and V latencies and the I to V interwave latencies before and 1 year after radiotherapy. The pure tone air conduction thresholds decreased, and the DPOAE levels increased in the treatment group compared with the control group....

Seventy nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases with epistasis after radiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The causes of epistasis were local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrent 34.3% (24/70), pseudoaneurysm 14.3% (10/70) and nasopharyngeal crust 51.4% (36/70). Seven cases with local recurrent, 3 cases with pseudoaneurysm and 1 cases with nasopharyngeal crust and osteoradionecrosis died of intractable epistasis. Epistasis in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is dangerous complication, especially in cases with local recurrent and pseudoaneurysm. Nasopharyngeal crust must be treated actively.

One hundred and nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group with 52 patients were carried out endoscopic thyroidectomy; and the second group with 57 patients was carried out open thyroidectomy. Clinical features including operation time, operative blood loss, hospitalization and complications were compared between the two groups. The average operative time was (105.1 +/- 30.2) min in endoscopic group and (145.3 +/- 27.4) min in open group (P&lt;0.01); the mean operative blood loss was (7.5 +/- 4.2) ml in endoscopic group and (48.6 +/- 18.6) ml in open group (P&lt;0.01); the average hospitalization after operation was (4.1 +/- 1.4) days and (8.0 +/- 1.9) days (P&lt;0.01), the complication rate was 5.8% in endoscopic group and 8.8% in open group (P&lt;0.01).

Fifty-three children diagnosed as OSAHS were included in the treatment group and underwent tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, and 51 normal children were employed as the control group. Main data monitered by PSG and growth hormone (GH) in children of the treatment group were recorded before and after surgery, in addition, growth hormone, height and weight of children in the treatment group and control group were respectively recorded and compared. Height and weight of children with OSAHS before treatment were lower than that of the normal children and the difference was significant (P&lt;0.05).

Twelve cases repaired with deltopectoral flaps and 7 cases repaired with pectoralis major flaps, impaired wound healing happened at distal end of one deltopectoral flap, and the wound was healing hy second intention after debridement and dressing change. All the other deltopectoral flaps and pectoralis major flaps stayed alive. Flaps stayed alive without the recurrence of ulcer after the long-term follow-up for one to ten years. The effectiveness of cervical radiation ulceration reconstruction by deltopectural flaps and pectoralis major flaps was proved. The reconstruction could prevent the recurrence of ulcer.

Jarosite is typically formed in aqueous environments at acidic pH. It decomposes to ferric oxohyroxides in humid climate. This gives rise to the question under which conditions jarosite was formed on Mars and what it can tell us about the climatic cycles and the former presence of water on Mars. We are looking at the phases of jarosite at elevated temperature and pressure and were able to show the stability of jarosite up to 6 GPa at room temperature and up to 3 GPa at 300 ^oC using neutron powder diffraction. Furthermore, we used inelastic incoherent neutron scattering to look at the vibrational modes of the hydroxyl groups in jarosite at various temperatures between 10K and 200K. [1] A.

The types of hypopharyngeal and cervical esophageal reconstruction included gastric transpostion, pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, free forearm flap, delto-pectoral skin flap, sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap, platysma myocutaneous flap and laryngeal-tracheal flap following carcinoma resection.

Prospective, controlled clinical study. Fifty-three patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (106 ears). Twenty-five patients (50 ears) received radiotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone for 14 days, and another 28 patients (56 ears) received radiotherapy alone. Pure tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) results were reviewed before and 1 year after radiotherapy. One year after radiotherapy, the air-and-bone conduction pure tone hearing thresholds increased, and the DPOAE levels decreased in the control group. There was no difference in the ABR wave I, III, and V latencies and the I to V interwave latencies before and 1 year after radiotherapy. The pure tone air conduction thresholds decreased, and the DPOAE levels increased in the treatment group compared with the control group....

Seventy nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases with epistasis after radiotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The causes of epistasis were local nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrent 34.3% (24/70), pseudoaneurysm 14.3% (10/70) and nasopharyngeal crust 51.4% (36/70). Seven cases with local recurrent, 3 cases with pseudoaneurysm and 1 cases with nasopharyngeal crust and osteoradionecrosis died of intractable epistasis. Epistasis in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is dangerous complication, especially in cases with local recurrent and pseudoaneurysm. Nasopharyngeal crust must be treated actively.

One hundred and nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group with 52 patients were carried out endoscopic thyroidectomy; and the second group with 57 patients was carried out open thyroidectomy. Clinical features including operation time, operative blood loss, hospitalization and complications were compared between the two groups. The average operative time was (105.1 +/- 30.2) min in endoscopic group and (145.3 +/- 27.4) min in open group (P&lt;0.01); the mean operative blood loss was (7.5 +/- 4.2) ml in endoscopic group and (48.6 +/- 18.6) ml in open group (P&lt;0.01); the average hospitalization after operation was (4.1 +/- 1.4) days and (8.0 +/- 1.9) days (P&lt;0.01), the complication rate was 5.8% in endoscopic group and 8.8% in open group (P&lt;0.01).

Fifty-three children diagnosed as OSAHS were included in the treatment group and underwent tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy, and 51 normal children were employed as the control group. Main data monitered by PSG and growth hormone (GH) in children of the treatment group were recorded before and after surgery, in addition, growth hormone, height and weight of children in the treatment group and control group were respectively recorded and compared. Height and weight of children with OSAHS before treatment were lower than that of the normal children and the difference was significant (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the data before surgery, oxygen saturation of blood in children of treatment group recorded by PSG increased (P&lt;0.05), while value of other data decreased (P&lt;0.05).
