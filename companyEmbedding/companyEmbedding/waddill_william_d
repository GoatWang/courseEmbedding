MILPITAS, Calif., July 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. today announced the election of William D. Waddill, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Calithera Biosciences, to the Protagonist Board of Directors.
"We are very pleased to welcome Will Waddill to the Board of Directors of Protagonist," said Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Patel. "We look forward to benefiting from Will's financial leadership and experience within the biotechnology sector as Protagonist continues to grow as an organization."








Mr. Waddill began his career in corporate finance, banking and public accounting 30 years ago. Prior to joining Calithera, he was SVP and CFO at OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, where he led a successful IPO and private equity financing, as well as three significant collaborations. Prior to that, he was SVP and CFO at Ilypsa, where he was finance lead for Ilypsa's acquisition by Amgen. Before joining Ilypsa, Mr. Waddill served as the founder and principal at Square One Finance, where he managed the finances of 33 start-up biotechnology companies, including eight that became public and six that were acquired. He holds a B.S. in accounting from the University of Illinois, Chicago, and certification as a public accountant (inactive), having begun his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte in Boston.
About Protagonist Therapeutics
Protagonist Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptide-based new chemical entities to address significant unmet medical needs. Its primary focus is on developing first-in-class oral peptide drugs that specifically target biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs. Compared to injectable antibody drugs, Protagonist's oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue compartment, potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, improved convenience and compliance due to oral delivery, lower cost, and an opportunity for earlier introduction of targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Protagonist's initial lead product candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are based on this approach, and the company believes they have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for IBD, a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
PTG-100, a potential first-in-class oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin specific antagonist peptide product candidate that is being developed initially for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, has now completed a phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers.  PTG-200, a potential first-in-class oral Interleukin-23 receptor antagonist that is being developed initially for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, is currently in IND-enabling studies. In addition to PTG-100 and PTG-200, the company has several other assets in different stages of research and pre-clinical development.
Protagonist is headquartered in Milpitas, California with its pre-clinical and clinical staff in California, and discovery operations both in California and in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. For further information, please visit http://www.protagonist-inc.com.

Employees







Waddill, William D.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Waddill, William D carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Waddill, William D currently holds license 1802 (Landscape Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Waddill, William D



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Waddill, William D



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Waddill, William D



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
