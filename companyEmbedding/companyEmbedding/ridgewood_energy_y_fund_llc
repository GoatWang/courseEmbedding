MONTVALE, N.J. and HOUSTON, Jan. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corp. ("Ridgewood Energy" or "Ridgewood"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Montvale, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas, has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil and Gas Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II"), with total commitments of $1.1 billion, reaching its hard cap.  The Fund, which had an original target amount of $750 million, has been formed by Ridgewood to invest in exploration and production of oil projects in the U.S. deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
Fund II is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on generating superior risk adjusted returns for investors by drilling and developing high-potential new oil fields.
The Fund's commitments were sourced from 39 institutional investors, including a number of leading state and union pension plans, well-known university endowments and foundations, and a number of Fund of Funds, private wealth managers and family offices.
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President, said, "Our focused investment strategy, coupled with disciplined execution, has demonstrated the potential to generate enormous value for our funds' limited partners.  We aim to continue delivering on that strategy for our Fund II LPs."
Fund II has already invested in two oil wells, one of which, the Dantzler Project, was drilled in partnership with Noble Energy Inc. (NYSE:   NBL) and resulted in an oil discovery (see Noble Energy Press Release).
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood's Founder and Chairman said, "We are extremely pleased with the strong reception to our latest private equity fund, which we believe reflects the growing importance sophisticated investors place on focused, value-added investment strategies executed by a specialized team of professionals with deep, industry-specific knowledge."   
Robert Gold, Senior Managing Director of Ridgewood, said, "We particularly appreciated receiving strong support from a diverse set of institutional investors with significant expertise in energy.  Fund II provided these investors with targeted asset-class exposure, along with the potential to deliver true alpha."
Ridgewood's $1.1 billion in commitments secured by Fund II comes in addition to $700 million in capital and commitments Ridgewood currently manages on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, ("Riverstone") the energy-focused private equity firm, through entities known as ILX Holdings I, LLC and ILX Holdings II, LLC (which are affiliates of Riverstone's two most recent private equity funds).  
Eaton Partners, LLC, based in Rowayton, CT, acted as placement agent for the fund.  Vinson & Elkins LLP, served as fund counsel.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Ridgewood Energy Exceeds Target and Closes Latest Fund at More Than $1.9 Billion

		  Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Oil Exploration and Production
		

Jul 21, 2015, 07:30 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Ridgewood Energy Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


HOUSTON and MONTVALE, N.J., July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ridgewood Energy Corporation ("Ridgewood Energy"), a private upstream oil and gas investment company based in Houston, Texas and Montvale, New Jersey, today announced that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Ridgewood Energy Oil & Gas Fund III, L.P. ("Fund III").  Fund III, Ridgewood Energy's largest fund to date, significantly exceeded its $1.5 billion target and closed with total capital commitments of more than $1.9 billion.  
Fund III is a continuation of Ridgewood Energy's investment program focused on finding and developing oil in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $20 per barrel or less. The Fund's commitments were sourced from leading institutional investors, including state and corporate pension plans, university endowments and foundations, as well as a number of private wealth managers and family offices.  
Kenny Lang, Ridgewood Energy's President and Chief Operating Officer said, "Our limited partners continue to recognize the outperformance potential of Ridgewood Energy's deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil strategy, where we have the ability to find and develop significant oil reserves for a very low cost per barrel.  Our disciplined approach allows us to deliver strong returns across a range of oil price environments, and recent dislocation in the sector has created even more compelling opportunities for investment."
Bob Gold, Senior Managing Director said, "We appreciate the very strong level of support for Fund III from both new and existing investors, which underscores Ridgewood's success to date, as well as our robust project pipeline." 
Robert Swanson, Ridgewood Energy's Founder and Chairman said, "The success of our strategy is driven by the discipline and rigor with which our outstanding team of industry professionals executes every phase of investment.  We look forward to continuing to deliver on Ridgewood's deepwater oil strategy with Fund III." 
Ridgewood Energy's latest fund follows Ridgewood Energy Oil & Gas Fund II, L.P ("Fund II"), which closed on $1.1 billion in early 2014. The firm also manages substantial capital and commitments for investment in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on behalf of Riverstone Holdings, LLC, which has invested alongside Ridgewood Energy's funds since 2010.

Overview
The Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

Trustee: 
 Starting Minimum Bid: $1,995
Description:  Estate’s interest in 1 share in Ridgewood Energy X Fund, LLC.  The share percentage represents 0.00209643% in the Energy X Fund.  The fund owns a working interest in some oil and gas leases.   
Ridgewood Energy is a private equity firm focused on investments in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. With more than two decades of experience investing in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas projects, Ridgewood Energy has earned its reputation as a reliable, professional, value-adding project partner to many leading energy companies. Ridgewood Energy applies a highly-disciplined evaluation process across a broad range of opportunities, and selects only those projects that meet the firm’s high standards for investment. Ridgewood participates in annual Federal offshore lease sales alongside industry partners. Ridgewood also acquires leasehold interests and participate in projects that exhibit compelling prospectivity.   
 As of 6/1/16, the debtors have received a combined total of $51,000 in payment royalties as a result of their original investment in Energy X Fund.  The payment stream documentation is linked below under ‘Payment History’ 
Upon completion of the auction, a stock transfer assignment will be provided to the winning bidder.  That new assignment must be submitted to Ridgewood Energy under the provisions of their document on the Energy X Fund (Article 9, Section 9.4) which permits ownership transfer due to bankruptcy filing by the share owner(s)     
Location Info  Ridgewood Energy is headquartered in Montvale, New Jersey, outside of Newark. The SEC prohibits foreign investors from owning any interest.  Ridgewood states potential buyers must meet specific financial criteria as required by the SEC (a minimum of $2,000,000 net worth excluding the value of a primary residence).

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
