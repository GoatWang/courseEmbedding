Imperial Capital goes bigger with $500 mln close of sixth mid-market fund
Imperial Capital Group, one of Canada’s oldest private equity firms, has raised $500 million for its sixth mid-market fund to create fresh opportunities for doing large-size deals. The Toronto investor in March closed Imperial Capital Acquisition Fund VI at its hard-cap target, 25 percent above its original goal of $400 million, Managing Partner Jeff Rosenthal told PE Hub Canada. It's the largest fund Imperial has raised in its 28-year history, exceeding by 70 percent the $295 million secured by Fund V in 2014.

Imperial Capital Group, one of Canada’s oldest private equity firms, has raised $500 million for its sixth mid-market fund to create fresh opportunities for doing large-size deals.
The Toronto investor in March closed Imperial Capital Acquisition Fund VI at its hard-cap target, 25 percent above its original goal of $400 million, Managing Partner Jeff Rosenthal told PE Hub Canada.
It’s the largest fund Imperial has raised in its 28-year history, exceeding by 70 percent the $295 million secured by Fund V in 2014. The close brings assets under management to more than $1 billion.
Imperial achieved this result by expanding its base of global limited partners, Rosenthal said. Some 304 LPs signed on to Fund VI.
The vast majority are high-net-worth investors, many of them contributors to the firm’s offerings since its earliest days. The rest are institutional investors, all of them Canadian.
Imperial obtained more commitments from both categories, with repeat LPs getting “the first kick at the can,” Rosenthal said. The fund finished with about 70 percent of its capital coming from wealthy investors and 30 percent from institutions.
Stephen Lister, Managing Partner, Imperial Capital Group
Rosenthal says Imperial “could have raised a lot more,” especially from the institutional community, but not without straying beyond its longstanding market strategy. 





Fund VI will show continuity with that strategy, making control or minority investments in North American mid-market companies with EBITDA of $5 million to $40 million and sales of $20 million to $250 million.
Deal flow will be uncovered in niche areas of healthcare and business and consumer services. Imperial for many years has specialized in these sectors, using in-house resources and external networks to identify, make and oversee investments.
Going bigger
With a deeper capital pool, Imperial is now positioned to execute more large-scale deals than in the past. The firm sought this capability on the fundraising trail after recent experience with a pair of investments undertaken by Fund VI’s predecessor, Rosenthal said.
Imperial Capital Acquisition Fund V, now almost fully invested, holds six companies. Among them is Ackerman Security Systems, a home alarm monitoring business, and Dental Corp, a group of dental-care clinics.
Justin MacCormack, Partner, Imperial Capital Group
Dental Corp, the focus of a $121 million investment in 2014, and Ackerman, acquired for a reported US$150 million in 2015, are Imperial’s largest transactions to date. The firm wrote the equity cheques by teaming up with OPTrust, a midsized Canadian pension fund. 





Rosenthal says the investment experience, coupled with Ackerman’s and Dental Corp’s subsequent portfolio performance, was rewarding. “It opened our eyes to the opportunities out there and encouraged us to pursue more of them with confidence,” he said.
The Ackerman and Dental Corp deals also confirmed the importance of having strong, “value-adding” co-investment partners, like OPTrust, Rosenthal said. He expects these partners, which “augment our tool kit,” to play a continued role in Fund VI’s deal-making.
Liquidity windfall
Along with helping to break new ground for Imperial, Fund V earlier this year realized a major portfolio win.
In February, STI Technologies, an outsourced pharma services and tech provider, was sold to QuintilesIMS. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Imperial, which has backed STI since 2013, scored a gross multiple of 6.3x its invested capital and a gross return of 72.9 percent, Rosenthal said.
The STI sale follows last year’s sale of Lise Watier, a maker of cosmetics, skincare and fragrances, to Groupe Marcelle. Imperial, which held the company for close to a decade, was awarded roughly 2x its money on a gross basis, Rosenthal said.
Glen Silvestri, Partner, Imperial Capital Group
Fund VI’s close has increased Imperial’s personnel needs, Rosenthal said. Since mid-2016, the firm has recruited about half a dozen new employees, bringing its investment team to 13 and its total complement to 29. Additional hires are in the works. 





Imperial was launched in 1989 by Rosenthal and Managing Partner Stephen Lister. The founders, then in their 20s, met in a real estate transaction and not long afterward resolved to form a private equity firm.
Other senior investment pros include Partner Justin MacCormack, who joined Imperial from Onex Corp in 2007 and today heads the healthcare team. Partner Glen Silvestri, who joined from Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan in 2014, leads the business-and consumer-services team.
Since inception, Imperial has undertaken almost 100 deals, including both platform investments and add-ons.

Imperial Capital’s Fund V crosses $250 mln finish line – and keeps going
After a year on the fund-raising trail, Toronto-based buyout firm Imperial Capital Group has exceeded the $250 million target set for its fifth fund, Imperial Capital Acquisition Fund V, peHUB Canada has learned. That’s double the capital committed to the firm’s previous fund, which closed in 2009. And with considerable commitments still outstanding, Fund V's final close, due before the end of 2013, is likely to be nearer to $300 million.

After a year on the fund-raising trail, Toronto-based buyout firm Imperial Capital Group has exceeded the $250 million target set for its fifth fund, Imperial Capital Acquisition Fund V, peHUB Canada has learned. That’s double the capital committed to the firm’s previous fund, which closed in 2009.
But Imperial is not done yet. In an exclusive interview with peHUB Canada, the firm’s co-founder and managing partner Jeff Rosenthal said “a considerable number” of outstanding commitments are likely to further increase the size of Fund V. He expects a final close nearer to $300 million before the end of 2013.
That’s not a small achievement in one of the toughest fund-raising markets on record.
What make Imperial’s success all the more impressive is that the investor base of its latest fund, made up primarily of high-net wealth (HNW) investors and family offices, totals 165 – a number that might cause heads to spin in the back offices of other PE firms. 





But Rosenthal says Imperial has since its founding in 1989 had a close rapport with HNW investors. That rapport has contributed to an entrepreneurial and partner-oriented culture that he and co-founder and managing partner Steve Lister have cultivated at the firm over the years. It’s reflected in Imperial’s governance, its market relationships, and its investment style.
Rosenthal calls it “feel and fit.”
“Steve and I both have entrepreneurial backgrounds, and we cut our teeth in the private equity business by working with HNW investors,” said Rosenthal. “These are very creative, very successful people” who bring more than just capital commitments, he noted. They “add value in a host of ways”, which includes an important contribution to the firm’s deal-making opportunities.
Imperial typically makes control-stake investments in lower mid-market companies located across Canada and the U.S. Enterprises most often have EBITDA in the range of $5 million and $15 million. They also tend to be led by managers with strong entrepreneurial instincts who feel a special resonance with Imperial “because they recognize that we are fellow entrepreneurs, rather than coming from a large institutional environment,” said Rosenthal. 





Imperial also resonates with business leaders because the firm’s investment pros know a thing or two about the sectors in which they operate. Long before the current PE trend favouring specialization, Imperial staked out a niche focus on three key sectors – branded consumer products, business services, and healthcare.
Rosenthal said this process was “evolutionary, not revolutionary.” He nonetheless acknowledged that Imperial’s accumulated sector knowledge and ability to undertake “deep dive” proprietary research has probably given it a competitive edge when it comes to sourcing opportunities, making acquisitions, and creating value.
The firm’s sector practice is evident in Kenra, an Indianapolis, Indiana-based producer of professional hair care products – bought in 2007 following research facilitated by Imperial’s CEO Partner Program, an initiative that allows its deal team to tap the expertise of seasoned executives. Partnering with a revamped company management team, Imperial helped create a more profitable and focused Kenra, and solidified its market position at a time of severe economic downturn, said Rosenthal. The enterprise’s sale in 2010 generated a multiple of 3.1x invested capital.
In another example, the firm in 2008 acquired Cincinnati, Ohio’s Schulman Associates IRB, a provider of clinical research review services to the pharmaceutical sector. Schulman is perhaps emblematic of the type of companies that most appeal to Imperial – the business is necessity-based and recession-resistant, and its growth potential is supported by emerging demographic trends. 





Imperial saw similar potential in Markham, Ont.-based AIM Health Group, a healthcare services provider taken private in 2011 with founder and CEO Dr. Lu Barbuto. The deal freed AIM from a “liquidity trap” and gave it new strategic direction, said Rosenthal. Within two years, two of AIM’s divisions were spun out. This included the clinical services division, which was acquired by a strategic buyer in July. Thereafter, the partners have been able to concentrate on the company’s corporate services unit, now operating as Workplace Health and Cost Solutions.
Imperial has to date made a dozen platform investments, and completed around 30-40 add-on acquisitions. The firm usually aims for a 30 percent net IRR on its deals, though its track record has shown net IRRs “considerably in excess of that,” said Rosenthal. Realizations have tended to triple the firm’s original capital investment.
There will be no “strategy drift” with Fund V, despite its larger capital pool. Imperial will instead undertake a few more sector-specific investments at consistent size ranges, keeping resources available for follow-ons. The firm made its first Fund V investment in May, and is currently planning for two new acquisitions and another exit in the coming months.
Imperial’s 24-year history began when Rosenthal and Lister met in a real estate transaction. In their 20s at the time, “we didn’t know what we didn’t know,” said Rosenthal, but the duo found they had a lot in common. In the early 1990s, he and Lister resolved to raise a PE fund, and ended up knocking on the doors of “approximately 400” HNW investors. The result was a $2.7 million close on the firm’s debut fund. 





Rosenthal said the firm was really put on the map in an early deal involving engineering consulting specialist Stantec. Founded in 1954 by Dr. Don Stanley, the company was by 1993 contending with succession issues. An “elephant” from Imperial’s perspective, it was bought with the help of institutional co-investors, and taken public in 1994. The Edmonton, Alta.-based Stantec is today a multi-billion dollar corporation, with close to 13,000 employees and over 200 locations worldwide.
