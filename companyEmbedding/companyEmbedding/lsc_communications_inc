LSC Communications, Inc. (NYSE:LKSD)Intraday Stock Chart
Today : Tuesday 25 July 2017



      This collaboration creates new solutions and products using machine 
      learning and artificial intelligence to drive discoverability and 
      deliver actionable insights for the Publishing Industry
    


      LSC Communications, Inc. (NYSE: LKSD), a leader in print and digital 
      media solutions, announced today an equity investment and the signing of 
      a definitive reseller agreement with Authors, Inc., an Austin, Texas 
      based developer of machine learning and artificial intelligence 
      applications for the Publishing Industry.
    

      With the goal of helping to increase publisher revenues, LSC will 
      harness Authors, Inc. technology to offer new services for publishers, 
      including intelligent editorial analysis, automated keyword enhancement 
      and actionable insights. Machine learning and AI help make titles 
      discoverable by recommending keywords, re-calibrating metadata 
      dynamically based on quarterly performance, and assessing content to 
      help predict the next bestseller.
    

      “In our continued journey to invest in new technologies, we are thrilled 
      to be making an investment in Authors, Inc.” said Thomas J. Quinlan III, 
      Chairman and CEO of LSC. “Machine learning and AI are positively 
      impacting many industries and we are excited about the new products and

Digital Print Solutions for Book Publishers

In the old days, long press runs were necessary to amortize the expense of a title. Costs were concentrated in the front-end camera work, plate-making, and press make-readies. Increasing the print quantity was the only way to reduce unit costs.
The Digital Print System has changed that scenario. By streamlining print production and its associated costs, titles can be economically produced in smaller quantities and on shorter schedules than ever before possible.
The LSC Communications Digital Print System utilizes high-speed digital presses for laser print-based production of publications from digitized files. Every digital press page is an original, so high-quality output is maintained throughout a print run without the waste and costs intrinsic to the offset printing process. Manufacturing schedules are greatly reduced yielding quick turnaround and delivery... whether you are printing 10, 100, or 1000 books.
