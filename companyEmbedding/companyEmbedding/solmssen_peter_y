      which align perfectly with our focus on building and preserving trust, 
      and delivering value for our customers and other key stakeholders,” said

      “I want to thank Tom for the invaluable contributions he made not only 
      at AIG, but over his entire outstanding career," continued Mr. Hancock. 
      "As one of the brightest legal minds in business, Tom has provided AIG 
      with wise counsel on virtually every area where insurance, finance, and 
      the law intersect. We wish Tom all the best in his well-deserved 
      retirement. I, and all of AIG, will miss his friendship, counsel, and 
      guidance.”
    

      Mr. Solmssen said: “AIG is a great company with a great legal, 
      compliance and regulatory team. Having spent my career helping lead 
      major global organizations in addressing their most important 
      challenges, I look forward to working with AIG’s leadership team in 
      pursuing its mission of providing essential services to consumers and 
      commercial customers around the world.”
    

      Mr. Russo said: “It has been a tremendous honor to work with Peter 
      Hancock and so many of the outstanding, dedicated employees of AIG, and, 
      in particular, my colleagues in the legal, compliance, regulatory, and 
      government affairs teams. I am grateful for their support and 
      friendship. I also want to welcome Peter Solmssen to AIG. With his 
      impressive track record and deep expertise, he is perfectly suited for 
      this critical role. I wish him every success.”

      leader in the firm's international and corporate practice. Mr. Solmssen

Education[edit]
Raised in part in West Germany, Solmssen graduated in 1972 from The Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania, and from Harvard University in 1976, where he won a travelling Knox Fellowship to attend Oxford University. He earned his JD in 1980 from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in Philadelphia, where he was articles editor of the law review. After graduation, Solmssen served for two years as law clerk to Federal District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Career[edit]
Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll[edit]
After his clerkship, Solmssen joined the law firm Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll as an associate. His first assignment was on the defense team advising the Dan River Corporation which was resisting a hostile, all-cash tender offer from companies controlled by Carl Icahn.[4] Solmssen was part of the team that devised a successful defense, based on a novel application of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Solmssen was so impressed by the Investment Company Act lawyers at Ballard that he asked to be transferred from the Ballard litigation department to the ´40 Act department, led by William Nutt and William Rheiner. It was a time of explosive growth in the mutual fund industry, and Ballard was a leading law firm in that practice. Ballard had a small office in Frankfurt, Germany, and the partner in charge soon discovered that Solmssen spoke German. He solicited Solmssen to spend some time in the Frankfurt office, covering for the resident lawyer while he was on holiday. Solmssen became more and more involved in the transnational corporate practice, until he was running a growing German companies practice. Solmssen was elected a partner of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll in 1988 with his wife, the first married lawyers to be elected partners at Ballard.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius[edit]
In 1989, the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius became one of the first major U.S. firms to open an office in West Germany. The firm recruited Solmssen from Ballard at that time to run its Frankfurt office.[5]
General Electric[edit]
General Electric Company, one of his clients, hired Solmssen in 1998 as corporate vice president and general counsel of GE Plastics.[6] In 2002 Solmssen became general counsel of GE Healthcare.[7] While there he helped negotiate the company’s acquisitions of Instrumentarium OY and Amersham plc and others. He also initiated ground-breaking collective action in the diagnostic imaging industry which culminated in the NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) Code. Under the NEMA Code sales and marketing practices which could have been considered suspect under the anti-kickback laws of many countries were ended or sharply curtailed.
Siemens[edit]
In the summer of 2007 Solmssen became general counsel and managing board member of Siemens AG. Peter Solmssen was the first American to serve on the Siemens board.[8] Siemens was in the early stages of a corruption scandal which had commenced in Munich and quickly spread to other countries, endangering the company’s survival.[9] In May 2007 the company had replaced its CEO with the first outsider in its history, Peter Löscher, who had been a senior executive at Amersham. Solmssen and Löscher knew each other from working together at GE. Löscher’s first priority was cleaning up the corruption scandal and asked Solmssen to lead that effort.[10] As the new general counsel at Siemens, Mr Solmssen faced the unusual challenge of rebuilding a compliance function that the bribery scandal had exposed as not only weak but sometimes corrupt.[11]
Solmssen and Löscher undertook an intense effort to resolve outstanding cases, change the culture, redesign compliance processes and make adherence to law and ethics a critical part of performance appraisals. To help address integrity issues in the future, a newly energised CCO and compliance function was established.[12] The corruption scandal, which began with a raid on the Siemens AG headquarters by over two hundred German police and investigators in November 2006 was concluded in December 2008 in a simultaneous settlement with the Munich public prosecutors office, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. On the same day, Siemens AG was confirmed as a “responsible contractor,” i.e. eligible to bid on government contracts, by the United States government. In the course of the investigations and settlement Siemens paid fines and incurred expenses exceeding $2.5 billion, but avoided much greater fines and debarment from governmental procurement programs around the world. For the first time in the history of the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United States Department of Justice recommended penalties lower than those prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines. Also for the first time, the Department recommended the appointment of a compliance monitor who was not an American lawyer. The appointment of Theo Waigel, the former Finance Minister of Germany, was groundbreaking and an important component of the successful implementation of the Siemens compliance program.
As a consequence of the settlements achieved with various enforcement agencies around the world, Solmssen became a leader in international efforts to combat corruption.[13] Under his direction, a monetary settlement with the World Bank was organized as a global campaign to combat corruption [14] pursuant to which Siemens committed to funding anti-corruption initiatives around the world. He led successful efforts at the World Economic Forum and the G20 to keep corruption high on the global policy agenda, and drove increased corporate participation in “collective action” to combat corruption.
Solmssen was also the Siemens board member responsible for its business in North and South America.[15] He appointed new CEOs all of the countries in his region of responsibility, moved Siemens USA´s headquarters from New York to Washington, DC, dramatically heightened Siemens' visibility, and promoted better relations with the US government. Siemens was mentioned by President Barack Obama in two successive State of the Union addresses for its commitment to vocational education and support for increased infrastructure focus.
AIG[edit]
In October 2016, Peter replaced Tom Russo as EVP and General Counsel of AIG, heading up the Global Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory functions. He leads an award winning team and reports directly into CEO Peter Hancock. Peter continues his anticorruption work and will be speaking on the topic at a conference being held by the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which will be in Summer 2017.
Personal[edit]
Solmssen is the eldest son of Arthur R. G. Solmssen and Marsha Moffat Solmssen. Before his retirement, Solmssen’s father was a partner in Saul, Ewing, Remick & Saul of Philadelphia and author of novels set in Philadelphia's Main Line western suburbs. Peter Solmssen is married to Sarah Elizabeth McCarty Solmssen, a partner at Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll.[16] The couple have three children.

As a consequence of the settlements achieved with various enforcement agencies around the world, Solmssen became a leader in international efforts to combat corruption.[13] Under his direction, a monetary settlement with the World Bank was organized as a global campaign to combat corruption [14] pursuant to which Siemens committed to funding anti-corruption initiatives around the world. He led successful efforts at the World Economic Forum and the G20 to keep corruption high on the global policy agenda, and drove increased corporate participation in “collective action” to combat corruption.
Solmssen was also the Siemens board member responsible for its business in North and South America.[15] He appointed new CEOs all of the countries in his region of responsibility, moved Siemens USA´s headquarters from New York to Washington, DC, dramatically heightened Siemens' visibility, and promoted better relations with the US government. Siemens was mentioned by President Barack Obama in two successive State of the Union addresses for its commitment to vocational education and support for increased infrastructure focus.
AIG[edit]
In October 2016, Peter replaced Tom Russo as EVP and General Counsel of AIG, heading up the Global Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory functions. He leads an award winning team and reports directly into CEO Peter Hancock. Peter continues his anticorruption work and will be speaking on the topic at a conference being held by the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which will be in Summer 2017.
Personal[edit]
Solmssen is the eldest son of Arthur R. G. Solmssen and Marsha Moffat Solmssen. Before his retirement, Solmssen’s father was a partner in Saul, Ewing, Remick & Saul of Philadelphia and author of novels set in Philadelphia's Main Line western suburbs. Peter Solmssen is married to Sarah Elizabeth McCarty Solmssen, a partner at Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll.[16] The couple have three children.

Education[edit]
Raised in part in West Germany, Solmssen graduated in 1972 from The Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania, and from Harvard University in 1976, where he won a travelling Knox Fellowship to attend Oxford University. He earned his JD in 1980 from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in Philadelphia, where he was articles editor of the law review. After graduation, Solmssen served for two years as law clerk to Federal District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Career[edit]
Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll[edit]
After his clerkship, Solmssen joined the law firm Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll as an associate. His first assignment was on the defense team advising the Dan River Corporation which was resisting a hostile, all-cash tender offer from companies controlled by Carl Icahn.[4] Solmssen was part of the team that devised a successful defense, based on a novel application of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Solmssen was so impressed by the Investment Company Act lawyers at Ballard that he asked to be transferred from the Ballard litigation department to the ´40 Act department, led by William Nutt and William Rheiner. It was a time of explosive growth in the mutual fund industry, and Ballard was a leading law firm in that practice. Ballard had a small office in Frankfurt, Germany, and the partner in charge soon discovered that Solmssen spoke German. He solicited Solmssen to spend some time in the Frankfurt office, covering for the resident lawyer while he was on holiday. Solmssen became more and more involved in the transnational corporate practice, until he was running a growing German companies practice. Solmssen was elected a partner of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll in 1988 with his wife, the first married lawyers to be elected partners at Ballard.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius[edit]
In 1989, the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius became one of the first major U.S. firms to open an office in West Germany. The firm recruited Solmssen from Ballard at that time to run its Frankfurt office.[5]
General Electric[edit]
General Electric Company, one of his clients, hired Solmssen in 1998 as corporate vice president and general counsel of GE Plastics.[6] In 2002 Solmssen became general counsel of GE Healthcare.[7] While there he helped negotiate the company’s acquisitions of Instrumentarium OY and Amersham plc and others. He also initiated ground-breaking collective action in the diagnostic imaging industry which culminated in the NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) Code. Under the NEMA Code sales and marketing practices which could have been considered suspect under the anti-kickback laws of many countries were ended or sharply curtailed.
Siemens[edit]
In the summer of 2007 Solmssen became general counsel and managing board member of Siemens AG. Peter Solmssen was the first American to serve on the Siemens board.[8] Siemens was in the early stages of a corruption scandal which had commenced in Munich and quickly spread to other countries, endangering the company’s survival.[9] In May 2007 the company had replaced its CEO with the first outsider in its history, Peter Löscher, who had been a senior executive at Amersham. Solmssen and Löscher knew each other from working together at GE. Löscher’s first priority was cleaning up the corruption scandal and asked Solmssen to lead that effort.[10] As the new general counsel at Siemens, Mr Solmssen faced the unusual challenge of rebuilding a compliance function that the bribery scandal had exposed as not only weak but sometimes corrupt.[11]
Solmssen and Löscher undertook an intense effort to resolve outstanding cases, change the culture, redesign compliance processes and make adherence to law and ethics a critical part of performance appraisals. To help address integrity issues in the future, a newly energised CCO and compliance function was established.[12] The corruption scandal, which began with a raid on the Siemens AG headquarters by over two hundred German police and investigators in November 2006 was concluded in December 2008 in a simultaneous settlement with the Munich public prosecutors office, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. On the same day, Siemens AG was confirmed as a “responsible contractor,” i.e. eligible to bid on government contracts, by the United States government. In the course of the investigations and settlement Siemens paid fines and incurred expenses exceeding $2.5 billion, but avoided much greater fines and debarment from governmental procurement programs around the world. For the first time in the history of the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United States Department of Justice recommended penalties lower than those prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines. Also for the first time, the Department recommended the appointment of a compliance monitor who was not an American lawyer. The appointment of Theo Waigel, the former Finance Minister of Germany, was groundbreaking and an important component of the successful implementation of the Siemens compliance program.
As a consequence of the settlements achieved with various enforcement agencies around the world, Solmssen became a leader in international efforts to combat corruption.[13] Under his direction, a monetary settlement with the World Bank was organized as a global campaign to combat corruption [14] pursuant to which Siemens committed to funding anti-corruption initiatives around the world. He led successful efforts at the World Economic Forum and the G20 to keep corruption high on the global policy agenda, and drove increased corporate participation in “collective action” to combat corruption.
Solmssen was also the Siemens board member responsible for its business in North and South America.[15] He appointed new CEOs all of the countries in his region of responsibility, moved Siemens USA´s headquarters from New York to Washington, DC, dramatically heightened Siemens' visibility, and promoted better relations with the US government. Siemens was mentioned by President Barack Obama in two successive State of the Union addresses for its commitment to vocational education and support for increased infrastructure focus.
AIG[edit]
In October 2016, Peter replaced Tom Russo as EVP and General Counsel of AIG, heading up the Global Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory functions. He leads an award winning team and reports directly into CEO Peter Hancock. Peter continues his anticorruption work and will be speaking on the topic at a conference being held by the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which will be in Summer 2017.
Personal[edit]
Solmssen is the eldest son of Arthur R. G. Solmssen and Marsha Moffat Solmssen. Before his retirement, Solmssen’s father was a partner in Saul, Ewing, Remick & Saul of Philadelphia and author of novels set in Philadelphia's Main Line western suburbs. Peter Solmssen is married to Sarah Elizabeth McCarty Solmssen, a partner at Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll.[16] The couple have three children.

Education[edit]
Raised in part in West Germany, Solmssen graduated in 1972 from The Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania, and from Harvard University in 1976, where he won a travelling Knox Fellowship to attend Oxford University. He earned his JD in 1980 from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in Philadelphia, where he was articles editor of the law review. After graduation, Solmssen served for two years as law clerk to Federal District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Career[edit]
Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll[edit]
After his clerkship, Solmssen joined the law firm Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll as an associate. His first assignment was on the defense team advising the Dan River Corporation which was resisting a hostile, all-cash tender offer from companies controlled by Carl Icahn.[4] Solmssen was part of the team that devised a successful defense, based on a novel application of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Solmssen was so impressed by the Investment Company Act lawyers at Ballard that he asked to be transferred from the Ballard litigation department to the ´40 Act department, led by William Nutt and William Rheiner. It was a time of explosive growth in the mutual fund industry, and Ballard was a leading law firm in that practice. Ballard had a small office in Frankfurt, Germany, and the partner in charge soon discovered that Solmssen spoke German. He solicited Solmssen to spend some time in the Frankfurt office, covering for the resident lawyer while he was on holiday. Solmssen became more and more involved in the transnational corporate practice, until he was running a growing German companies practice. Solmssen was elected a partner of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll in 1988 with his wife, the first married lawyers to be elected partners at Ballard.
Morgan, Lewis & Bockius[edit]
In 1989, the Philadelphia law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius became one of the first major U.S. firms to open an office in West Germany. The firm recruited Solmssen from Ballard at that time to run its Frankfurt office.[5]
General Electric[edit]
General Electric Company, one of his clients, hired Solmssen in 1998 as corporate vice president and general counsel of GE Plastics.[6] In 2002 Solmssen became general counsel of GE Healthcare.[7] While there he helped negotiate the company’s acquisitions of Instrumentarium OY and Amersham plc and others. He also initiated ground-breaking collective action in the diagnostic imaging industry which culminated in the NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) Code. Under the NEMA Code sales and marketing practices which could have been considered suspect under the anti-kickback laws of many countries were ended or sharply curtailed.
Siemens[edit]
In the summer of 2007 Solmssen became general counsel and managing board member of Siemens AG. Peter Solmssen was the first American to serve on the Siemens board.[8] Siemens was in the early stages of a corruption scandal which had commenced in Munich and quickly spread to other countries, endangering the company’s survival.[9] In May 2007 the company had replaced its CEO with the first outsider in its history, Peter Löscher, who had been a senior executive at Amersham. Solmssen and Löscher knew each other from working together at GE. Löscher’s first priority was cleaning up the corruption scandal and asked Solmssen to lead that effort.[10] As the new general counsel at Siemens, Mr Solmssen faced the unusual challenge of rebuilding a compliance function that the bribery scandal had exposed as not only weak but sometimes corrupt.[11]
Solmssen and Löscher undertook an intense effort to resolve outstanding cases, change the culture, redesign compliance processes and make adherence to law and ethics a critical part of performance appraisals. To help address integrity issues in the future, a newly energised CCO and compliance function was established.[12] The corruption scandal, which began with a raid on the Siemens AG headquarters by over two hundred German police and investigators in November 2006 was concluded in December 2008 in a simultaneous settlement with the Munich public prosecutors office, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. On the same day, Siemens AG was confirmed as a “responsible contractor,” i.e. eligible to bid on government contracts, by the United States government. In the course of the investigations and settlement Siemens paid fines and incurred expenses exceeding $2.5 billion, but avoided much greater fines and debarment from governmental procurement programs around the world. For the first time in the history of the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United States Department of Justice recommended penalties lower than those prescribed by federal sentencing guidelines. Also for the first time, the Department recommended the appointment of a compliance monitor who was not an American lawyer. The appointment of Theo Waigel, the former Finance Minister of Germany, was groundbreaking and an important component of the successful implementation of the Siemens compliance program.
As a consequence of the settlements achieved with various enforcement agencies around the world, Solmssen became a leader in international efforts to combat corruption.[13] Under his direction, a monetary settlement with the World Bank was organized as a global campaign to combat corruption [14] pursuant to which Siemens committed to funding anti-corruption initiatives around the world. He led successful efforts at the World Economic Forum and the G20 to keep corruption high on the global policy agenda, and drove increased corporate participation in “collective action” to combat corruption.
Solmssen was also the Siemens board member responsible for its business in North and South America.[15] He appointed new CEOs all of the countries in his region of responsibility, moved Siemens USA´s headquarters from New York to Washington, DC, dramatically heightened Siemens' visibility, and promoted better relations with the US government. Siemens was mentioned by President Barack Obama in two successive State of the Union addresses for its commitment to vocational education and support for increased infrastructure focus.
AIG[edit]
In October 2016, Peter replaced Tom Russo as EVP and General Counsel of AIG, heading up the Global Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory functions. He leads an award winning team and reports directly into CEO Peter Hancock. Peter continues his anticorruption work and will be speaking on the topic at a conference being held by the The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which will be in Summer 2017.
Personal[edit]
Solmssen is the eldest son of Arthur R. G. Solmssen and Marsha Moffat Solmssen. Before his retirement, Solmssen’s father was a partner in Saul, Ewing, Remick & Saul of Philadelphia and author of novels set in Philadelphia's Main Line western suburbs. Peter Solmssen is married to Sarah Elizabeth McCarty Solmssen, a partner at Ballard, Spahr, Andrews, & Ingersoll.[16] The couple have three children.

      Hancock and so many of the outstanding, dedicated employees of AIG, and, 
      in particular, my colleagues in the legal, compliance, regulatory, and 
      government affairs teams. I am grateful for their support and 
      friendship. I also want to welcome Peter Solmssen to AIG. With his 
      impressive track record and deep expertise, he is perfectly suited for 
      this critical role. I wish him every success.”

"As one of the brightest legal minds in business, Tom has provided AIG with wise counsel on virtually every area where insurance, finance, and the law intersect. We wish Tom all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I, and all of AIG, will miss his friendship, counsel, and guidance."

Item Description: TusQuets Editores, 2010. soft. Book Condition: New. Berlín, 1922. Reina la confusión en la capital alemana tras la victoria aliada. Recorren las calles, con banderas rojas, las víctimas de la más impresionante inflación de todos los tiempos. Y, tras ellos, las bandas incontroladas de ex-combatientes nacionalistas, que siguen las consignas de un oscuro militar austríaco, Adolf Hitler. Indiferentes al barullo callejero, conservan aún sus privilegios unas pocas familias aristocráticas, en su mayoría judíos, de gran tradición en el mundo de las finanzas. En este escenario irrumpen el americano Peter Ellis y el alemán Christoph. Peter vive una doble vida : frecuenta, por un lado, los elegantes salones de nobles y banqueros y, por otro, los tugurios bohemios de los artistas. Para su desgracia, se enamora de la hija de la familia Waldstein, a la vez que se ve involucrado sin querer en un asesinato político, que presagia ya los horrores del Tercer Reich. Poco a poco, todos se ven arrastrados en el torbellino de desatinos que sacude a Alemania y que la prepara para la dictadura nacionalsocialista. *** Nota: EL COSTE DE ENVÍO A CANARIAS ES 8 euros. Si ha realizado un pedido con destino a CANARIAS no podemos hacer el envío con un coste de 3,5 euros . Nos pondremos en contacto con usted para comunicar el coste total del envío a Canarias y si está de acuerdo, Abebooks le efectuará el cargo adicional.  Bookseller Inventory # 2075644

Paperback, 438 S. bb 534; OT.: A PRINCESS IN BERLIN.(1980); Arthur R.G.Solmssen, geb.1929 in New York, verfasste einen Gesellschaftsroman besonderer Art: Er führt exemplarisch Menschenschicksale im Zeitgeschehen vor und veranschaulicht Zeitgeschichte an den Lebenswegen gefährdeter Menschen. Schauplatz der Handlung ist das Deutschland der Jahre 1922/23 mit seinen grellen Gegensätzen. Der Ernüchterung nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg war der Katzenjammer der Reaktion auf den Versailler Vertrag gefolgt. Das Signal, das rote Matrosen im November 1918 in Kiel setzten, hatte Hoffnungen bewirkt, die etablierte alte Ordnung zu stürzen - doch die Konterrevolution marschierte offen. Nun zeigt sich die Ohnmacht der Weimarer Republik von Tag zu Tag mehr: Gewalt und Terror alter militaristischer Prägung überziehen das Land. Eine Inflation ungeheuren Ausmaßes, gesteuert vom deutschen Finanzkapital, nimmt ihren Lauf. In das Berlin jener Tage gerät der junge amerikanische Student Peter Ellis, der hier seine Malstudien fortsetzen will. Berlin - erbarmungswürdig und verführerisch zugleich, blasiert und abgebrüht. Berlin, in dem sich überschwappende Genußfreude mit Laster und Sensation paart - kurz: Berlin läßt eine frivole Großstadtgesellschaft a la Otto Dix und George Grosz an dem Helden vorbeiparadieren, angesiedelt am Tauentzien und in den Amüsierlokalen der Friedrichstraße, im vierten Hinterhof oder in nobler Beletage. Jüdische Bankiers und deren Anwälte, Geschäftsleute, Börsenjobber und Schwarzmarktgewinnler aller Art kreuzen seine Bahn ebenso wie abgetakelte Generäle, Aristokraten, Mordschützen des Kapp-Putsches oder Maler, Dichter, Musiker mit Schöpfermut und energischer Besessenheit.; Einbd.-gest.v.Roswitha Grüttner.; TADELLOSER ZUSTAND.

Item Description: Tusquets Editores, Barcelona, Spain, 1982. Soft cover. Book Condition: New. No Jacket. Berlín, 1922. Reina la confusión en la capital alemana tras la victoria aliada. Recorren las calles, con banderas rojas, las víctimas de la más impresionante inflación de todos los tiempos. Y, tras ellos, las bandas incontroladas de ex-combatientes nacionalistas, que siguen las consignas de un oscuro militar austríaco, Adolf Hitler. Indiferentes al barullo callejero, conservan aún sus privilegios unas pocas familias aristocráticas, en su mayoría judíos, de gran tradición en el mundo de las finanzas. En este escenario irrumpen el americano Peter Ellis y el alemán Christoph. Peter vive una doble vida : frecuenta, por un lado, los elegantes salones de nobles y banqueros y, por otro, los tugurios bohemios de los artistas. Para su desgracia, se enamora de la hija de la familia Waldstein, a la vez que se ve involucrado sin querer en un asesinato político, que presagia ya los horrores del Tercer Reich. Poco a poco, todos se ven arrastrados en el torbellino de desatinos que sacude a Alemania y que la prepara para la dictadura nacionalsocialista.  Bookseller Inventory # 012093
