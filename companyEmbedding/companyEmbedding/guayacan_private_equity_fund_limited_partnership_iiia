Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.                     
-------------------------------------------------             

         Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 18,
1999 and amended as of June 28, 1999 (the "Securities Purchase Agreement"), by  
and among Wyndham, Patriot American Hospitality, Inc. ("Patriot"), Patriot      
American Hospitality Partnership, L.P. ("Patriot OP"), Wyndham International    
Operating Partnership, L.P. and certain investors (the "Original Investors")    
were entitled, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth    
therein, to purchase 10,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, 
$0.01 per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), of Wyndham for aggregate      
consideration of $1,000,000,000.  Certain of the Original Investors subsequently
entered into Assignment and Assumption Agreements (the "Assignments") with      
certain other investors, including GPEF, (collectively, the "Co-Investors" and, 
together with the Original Investors, the "Investors"), pursuant to which such  
Original Investors assigned to the Co-Investors their right to purchase certain 
of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock that such Original Investors were     
entitled to purchase under the Securities Purchase Agreement.                   

    Pursuant to an Assignment, GPEF purchased an aggregate of 10,000
shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of      
$1,000,000.  GPEF obtained funds to make the purchase described herein through  
capital contributions from its limited partners.                                

Item 4.  Purpose of Transactions.                                               
-----------------------                                       

          GPEF has purchased the Series B Preferred Stock for general investment
purposes and retains the right to change its investment intent.  Subject to     
market conditions and other factors, including the restrictive provisions of the
Securities Purchase Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement described below,  
GPEF may acquire or dispose of securities of Wyndham from time to time in future
open-market, privately negotiated or other transactions.  Such acquisitions     
could include purchases pursuant to the Rights Offering (as defined below) or   
pursuant to the exercise of preemptive rights as described below.               

     The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the
holder, into shares of Wyndham Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share  
(the "Class B Common Stock"), which in turn is convertible on a one for one     
basis into the Shares.  For each share of Series B Preferred Stock converted    
into Class B Common Stock, the holder is entitled to receive that number of     
shares of Class B Common Stock equal to $100.00 divided by the conversion price 
of the Series B Preferred Stock, which is currently $8.59 per share, subject to 
adjustment, in addition to accrued but unpaid dividends.  Each share of the     
Series B Preferred Stock may also be converted into one share of Series A       
Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Series A Preferred 
Stock"), of Wyndham and, other than certain permitted transfers under the       
Securities Purchase Agreement, is mandatorily converted into one share of Series
A Preferred Stock if it is transferred to unaffiliated transferees.  The Series 
A Preferred Stock will be convertible into Shares at the same conversion rate   
from time to time in effect at which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible
into shares of Class B Common Stock.                                            

      Both the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock
will pay quarterly dividends at the rate per annum of 9.75% of the stated amount
thereof, with a portion paid in cash and a portion paid in additional shares of 
Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred

Stock, respectively. The Series A Preferred Stock will vote on an as converted  
basis with the Shares on matters submitted to the holders of the Shares and the 
Series B Preferred Stock will vote as a separate class on certain specified     
matters, including specified "change of control" events occurring prior to June
30, 2005. The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are otherwise identical to  
the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, except that the Series A Preferred   
Stock will not have voting rights, except as required by law or as necessary to 
permit its listing.                                                             

Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement and the
Certificate of Designation for the Series B Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of
Designation"), during the 170-day period following the closing of the           
transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement, which occurred  
on June 30, 1999,  Wyndham has the right to redeem on a pro rata basis up to    
3,000,000 of the 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock currently held by
the Investors with the proceeds of (i) a rights offering in which the holders of
Wyndham's common stock and Patriot OP's limited partnership interests may       
purchase for cash up to 3,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the       
"Rights Offering") and/or (ii) the sale of specified assets of Wyndham in excess
of a fixed price at or prior to the closing of the Rights Offering, in each case
at a redemption price of 102% of the stated amount of $100 per share, plus      
accrued but unpaid dividends to the redemption date.                            

   Under the terms of the restated certificate of incorporation of
Wyndham (the "Restated Certificate"), on June 30, 1999, the Board of Directors  
of Wyndham (the "Board") was reconstituted to consist of 19 directors, including
eight Class A directors designated by the Board as it existed prior to being    
reconstituted (the "Prior Board"), eight Class B directors designated by the    
Investors and three Class C directors mutually designated by the existing Board 
of Directors and the Investors.  The Board is further classified by term of     
office into three classes of directors, each serving a staggered term of three  
years, until the annual meeting of Wyndham's stockholders in 2002.              

      The number of Class B directors that the Investors are entitled to
designate will decrease from seven to zero based on certain specified beneficial
ownership percentages of Wyndham Common Stock as more fully set forth in the    
Restated Certificate.                                                           

        The Securities Purchase Agreement provides that until June 30, 2004,
so long as the Investors collectively own more than 15% of the fully diluted    
Wyndham common stock, in the event that Wyndham proposes to sell Wyndham common 
stock or securities convertible into Wyndham common stock (other than in the    
Rights Offering or during the six month period following June 30, 1999), each of
the Investors will have the right to purchase a portion of the securities       
proposed to be sold equal to its percentage ownership of Wyndham's outstanding  
securities. To the extent that one or more of the Investors does not exercise   
its purchase rights in full, the unexercised portion of the Investor's purchase 
rights will be allocated pro rata to the other Investors.                       

        The Securities Purchase Agreement also provides that, during the six
year period following June 30, 1999, the Investors will not (i) acquire any     
shares of Wyndham common stock or securities convertible for Wyndham common     
stock, unless the securities are acquired (a) directly from Wyndham in a        
transaction approved by a majority of the Class A and Class C directors, (b) as 
a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock or upon conversion of the Series B

Preferred Stock, (c) as part of Wyndham's sale of Series A Preferred Stock or   
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, (d) by an affiliate of any     
Investor over whom the Investor does not control voting decisions or hold over  
50% of the outstanding voting securities, (e) as non-voting preferred stock of  
Wyndham, (f) in the ordinary course of the Investor's market-making activities  
or as investment adviser or broker-dealer or (g) by an employee, partner or     
stockholder of an Investor for his individual account if the individual does not
acquire beneficial ownership of over 100,000 shares of Wyndham common stock; or 
(ii) make any public announcement or proposal or solicitation of proxies        
concerning any business combination, extraordinary transaction, restructuring or
recapitalization involving Wyndham or any affiliate of Wyndham or propose to    
seek representation on the Board or seek to control or influence management, the
Board or policies of Wyndham or an affiliate of Wyndham.                        

       As contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Board has
adopted a shareholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan") under which rights        
distributed to Wyndham's stockholders will become exercisable in the event a    
third party (other than a "Grandfathered Person") acquires beneficial ownership 
of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Wyndham common stock.  Each        
Investor will be a "Grandfathered Person" for so long as it complies with the   
standstill provisions of Section 7.1 of the Securities Purchase Agreement       
described above.                                                                

          On June 29, 1999, the Investors entered into a Stockholders' Agreement
(the "Stockholders' Agreement"), pursuant to which each of (i) Apollo Management
and Apollo Real Estate Management (collectively, the "Apollo Stockholder") and  
(ii) THL Advisors (together with the Apollo Stockholder, the "Lead              
Stockholders") will have the right, for so long as the Investors are entitled to
designate eight Class B directors to the Board, to designate four directors to  
the Board.  At such time as the Investors are entitled to designate fewer than  
eight Class B directors, the right to designate will be allocated as between the
Apollo Stockholder and THL Advisory based on a specified formula.  For so long  
as the Stockholders' Agreement is in effect, each of the Investors has agreed to
vote its Shares and Series B Preferred Stock in favor of each of the director   
nominees of the Lead Stockholders.                                              

          The Stockholders' Agreement provides that, for a five year period from
June 29, 1999, no Investor may offer, sell or otherwise dispose of its shares of
Series B Preferred Stock without the consent of each of the Lead Stockholders,  
except for (i) transfers to affiliated transferees, (ii) transfers of shares    
pursuant to the registration rights, tag along rights or drag along provisions  
described below, (iii) bona fide pledges of shares to a bank, financial         
institution or other lender and (iv) certain other permitted transfers, subject 
in case of certain of these transfers to the transferee agreeing to be bound by 
the provisions of the Stockholders' Agreement.  The Stockholders' Agreement does
provide, however, for certain "tag-along rights" and "drag-along rights" in     
favor of non-transferring stockholders with respect to proposed transfers of    
securities.                                                                     

On February 18, 1999, the Original Investors entered into a 
Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with        
Wyndham, pursuant to which the Investors have the right to require Wyndham to   
register shares of Wyndham preferred stock or shares of Wyndham common stock    
into which the Wyndham preferred stock converts in one or more registrations    
and/or pursuant to a shelf registration statement.  The Stockholders' Agreement 
provides, however, that (i) any request for a registration by Wyndham on or     
prior to

registration by Wyndham between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of
the Stockholders' Agreement may only be made by the Apollo Stockholder, THL     
Advisors or Beacon Capital Partners, L.P. and its affiliates and (iii) any      
request for a shelf registration statement on or prior to the fifth anniversary 
of the date of the Stockholders' Agreement may be made only by or with the      
consent of the Lead Stockholders.                                               

        The Securities Purchase Agreement, the Assignment to which GPEF is a
party, the Stockholders' Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement        
described are filed as exhibits to this Schedule 13D and are incorporated herein
by reference.  The Certificate of Designation, the Restated Certificate and the 
Rights Plan have been filed as exhibits to filings by Wyndham with the          
Securities and Exchange Commission.  The foregoing descriptions of such         
agreements are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety  
by reference to such exhibits.                                                  

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.                                  
------------------------------------                          

   (a) and (b).   By virtue of the Stockholders' Agreement and the
relationships described herein, the Investors may be deemed to constitute a     
"group" within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act.  As of the  
date hereof, to the knowledge of the Reporting Persons, the Investors           
collectively own an aggregate of 116,414,435 Shares or 41.2% of the Outstanding 
Shares (as defined below).  For purposes of calculating ownership percentages in
this Schedule 13D, the number of "Outstanding Shares" includes (i) the          
165,886,524 Shares outstanding on July 9, 1999, based on information provided to
the Investors by Wyndham and (ii) the Shares issuable upon conversion of the    
Series B Preferred Stock held by the Investor or Investors whose ownership is   
being measured, excluding for such purpose the Shares issuable upon conversion  
of any other shares of Series B Preferred Stock or other convertible securities.
Each of the Reporting Persons expressly disclaim beneficial ownership of those  
Investors' Shares held by any other members of such group or of Shares held     
individually by certain directors or executive officers of certain of the       
Investors.                                                                      

          Pursuant to the Assignment to which GPEF is a party, GPEF has obtained
direct beneficial ownership of 116,414 Shares pursuant to the Securities        
Purchase Agreement, representing less than 0.1% of the Outstanding Shares.  By  
virtue of the relationship among the Reporting Persons described herein, each of
the Reporting Persons may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power with  
respect to the 116,414 shares directly owned by GEPF.                           

          All of the foregoing information as to number of Shares and percentage
of Outstanding Shares beneficially owned is set forth without giving effect to  
the accrual of dividends payable in additional shares of Series B Preferred     
Stock.  In addition, as discussed above, the numbers of Shares listed above are 
each subject to reduction of up to 30% if the Series B Preferred Stock redeemed 
by Wyndham with the proceeds of the Rights Offering, depending upon the         
participation in the Rights Offering.                                           

         Neither the filing of this Schedule 13D nor any of its contents shall
be deemed to constitute an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial
owner of any of the Shares other than those which GPEF has acquired pursuant to 
the Assignment to which GPEF is a party.
