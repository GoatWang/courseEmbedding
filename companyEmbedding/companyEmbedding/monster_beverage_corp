History[edit]
Hansen's was founded in 1935.[5] In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label.[6]
The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares.[7]
In April 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled products containing high-fructose corn syrup could not be labeled "natural".[8] Shortly after, Hansen's Natural Corporation announced they had begun using cane sugar instead.[9]
In September 2009, Hansen brand Monster Energy sent a cease and desist letter to Rock Art Brewery, demanding the microbrewery stop selling its new Vermonster beer, drop its pursuit of a federal trademark for the name, and pay Hansen's lawyer fees. This resulted in a boycott of all Hansen products by a few Vermont retailers.[10]
In June 2015 Coca-Cola North America took ownership of Hansen’s juice products and sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Blue Sky sodas, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands.[11]

The brand was introduced in 1991 by McCain Foods,[15] and sold to the Pasco Beverage Group in 2000[16] before being sold again, to Hansen's. Hansen's replaced the original four mascots, Uncle Froggy, Emily the Mouse, Ronald Rabbit, and Nick the Fox,[17] with Clifford the Big Red Dog.
In July 2008, Hansen's introduced Hansen's Organic Junior Water, in 4.23-ounce packages aimed at children between two and six years old.

Also in 2008, organic Junior Water was introduced.

History[edit]
Hansen's was founded in 1935.[5] In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label.[6]
The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares.[7]

Hansen's replaced the original four mascots, Uncle Froggy, Emily the Mouse, Ronald Rabbit, and Nick the Fox,[17] with Clifford the Big Red Dog.
In July 2008, Hansen's introduced Hansen's Organic Junior Water, in 4.23-ounce packages aimed at children between two and six years old. The Hansen's Organic Junior Water line of flavored water contains 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C and thirty calories per serving. Also in 2008, organic Junior Water was introduced. Hansen's later introduced Coconut Water Twist, containing coconut water,[18] and Garden Twist, a combination of fruits and vegetables, which is the only Junior Juice variant to be sold in bottles.[18]
Other beverages[edit]
Smoothies, Rumba Energy Juice, Energade, and Energy Formula, are minor products. Monster owns Blue Sky Beverage Company, which manufactures several soft drinks. Monster produces the Monster, Lost, and Rumba energy drinks, which were previously distributed in the United States by Anheuser Busch.[19] On November 10, 2008, distribution of the Monster Energy and Monster Java products was turned over to Coca-Cola Enterprises.
In August 2009, Hansen's introduced the SELF Beauty Elixir line, a low-calorie beverage containing vitamins, minerals, natural fruit & botanical extracts, antioxidants and 30% fruit juice. The beverage contains 35 calories and a low amount of sodium per 8-ounce aluminum can.

History[edit]
Hansen's was founded in 1935.[5] In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label.[6]
The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares.[7]
In April 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled products containing high-fructose corn syrup could not be labeled "natural".[8] Shortly after, Hansen's Natural Corporation announced they had begun using cane sugar instead.[9]
In September 2009, Hansen brand Monster Energy sent a cease and desist letter to Rock Art Brewery, demanding the microbrewery stop selling its new Vermonster beer, drop its pursuit of a federal trademark for the name, and pay Hansen's lawyer fees. This resulted in a boycott of all Hansen products by a few Vermont retailers.[10]
In June 2015 Coca-Cola North America took ownership of Hansen’s juice products and sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Blue Sky sodas, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands.[11]
Products[edit]
Natural soda[edit]
Natural Soda comes in twelve flavors: Original Cola, Ginger Ale, Key Lime Twist, Cherry Vanilla Creme, Grapefruit, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cola, Mandarin Lime, Creamy Root Beer, Raspberry, Mango Orange, and Pomegranate.[12] All Hansen's sodas are made with cane sugar.
Energy drinks[edit]




Monster Energy Logo


Energy drinks include Hansen's Natural Energy Pro and Hansen's Energy Diet Red. The Monster Energy brand includes beverages such as Java Monster, Monster Rehab, and Muscle Monster.[13]
Diet soda[edit]
Their Diet Soda is available in ten flavors: Cola, Black Cherry, Peach, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cherry Créme,Tangerine Lime, Ginger Ale, Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate. Hansen's diet soda is sweetened with acesulfame potassium and sucralose. All diet sodas are OU Kosher certified.[5][not in citation given]
Drink mixers[edit]
Monster Beverage sells three flavors of soda mixer: Tonic, Ginger Ale, and Club Soda.
Fruit juices[edit]
The company sells thirteen fruit juices in 64-ounce PET bottles, several of which are available in smaller bottles for kids. These include Apple, Grape, White Grape, Pineapple, Apple Grape, Apple Strawberry, Orange, Cranberry Apple, Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pomegranate, Organic Apple White Grape, Organic Apple Wild Berry and Organic Apple. Hansen's Natural Organic Apple Juice is made solely from concentrates the company obtains from China. Hansen's uses concentrates from China in other varieties of its juices, despite the availability of such juice concentrates made from fruit grown and processed in the United States, which grows an abundance of apples, as well as many of the other fruits used in Hansen's juice products. These juices contain 120% of the United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDA) for Vitamin C (except Pomegranate, which contains 100%).[citation needed]
In 2009, Monster Beverage introduced Hansen's Natural Lo-Cal 64-ounce juice cocktails, in four flavors. They are sweetened with Truvia.
Hansen's fruit juice smoothies contain approximately 25% juice and provide 100% of the recommended daily adult intake of Vitamins A, C, and E. They are packaged in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans.
Juices for children[edit]
Hansen's Juice Blast line of children's juice drinks was launched in conjunction with Costco and sold in Costco stores. Hansen also has a Juice Slam line of children's juice drinks. Both lines are sold in 6.75-ounce boxes.
In May 2001, Hansen's acquired the Junior Juice beverage business.[14] Hansen's Junior Juice is 100% juice, sold in 4.23-ounce cartons and targeted at toddlers and preschoolers. Certain flavors of Junior Juice have calcium added and all flavors contain 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C. The brand was introduced in 1991 by McCain Foods,[15] and sold to the Pasco Beverage Group in 2000[16] before being sold again, to Hansen's. Hansen's replaced the original four mascots, Uncle Froggy, Emily the Mouse, Ronald Rabbit, and Nick the Fox,[17] with Clifford the Big Red Dog.
In July 2008, Hansen's introduced Hansen's Organic Junior Water, in 4.23-ounce packages aimed at children between two and six years old. The Hansen's Organic Junior Water line of flavored water contains 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C and thirty calories per serving. Also in 2008, organic Junior Water was introduced. Hansen's later introduced Coconut Water Twist, containing coconut water,[18] and Garden Twist, a combination of fruits and vegetables, which is the only Junior Juice variant to be sold in bottles.[18]

Energy Company
The Coca-Cola Company System to Expand
Monster Distribution in U.S. and Canada and become Monster’s Preferred Global
Distribution Partner
ATLANTA and CORONA, CA., Aug.
14, 2014 – The
Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) and Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST)
announced today that they have entered into definitive agreements for a long-term strategic partnership
that is expected to accelerate growth for both companies in the fast-growing,
global energy drink category.  The new,
innovative partnership leverages the respective strengths of The Coca-Cola
Company and Monster to create compelling value for both companies and their
shareowners.

Importantly, the partnership
strategically aligns both companies for the long-term by combining the strength
of The Coca-Cola Company’s worldwide bottling system with Monster’s dedicated
focus and expertise as a leading energy player globally.
Details of the Transactions:
Equity
Investment: In an
effort to align long-term interests, The Coca-Cola Company will acquire an
approximately 16.7% ownership interest in Monster (post issuance) and will have
two directors on Monster’s Board of Directors.  The Coca-Cola Company expects to account for its
investment in Monster under the equity accounting method.
Business Transfers: To
optimally align product portfolios and enable those portfolios to benefit from
each company’s respective brand marketing, production and distribution
strengths and optimize the parties’ capital and resource allocation, The
Coca-Cola Company will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business,
including NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Play and Power Play, and
Relentless, to Monster; and Monster will transfer its non-energy business,
including Hansen’s Natural Sodas, Peace Tea, Hubert’s Lemonade and Hansen’s
Juice Products, to The Coca-Cola Company.
Distribution: The Coca-Cola Company and Monster
will amend their current distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada by expanding
into additional territories and entering into long-term agreements.  The Coca-Cola Company will become Monster’s
preferred distribution partner globally and Monster will become The Coca-Cola
Company’s exclusive energy play.  These
agreements will deliver sustainable value to The Coca-Cola Company’s global
system and accelerate Monster’s opportunity to grow internationally.

Pursuant to the terms of the
transaction agreements, at the closing, The Coca-Cola Company will make a net
cash payment of $2.15 billion and transfer its worldwide energy business to
Monster. In exchange, Monster will issue to The Coca-Cola Company the shares of
Monster common stock, transfer its non-energy business to The Coca-Cola
Company, and enter into expanded distribution arrangements.  The transaction, which is expected to close
late in 2014 or early in 2015, is subject to customary closing conditions,
including receipt of regulatory approvals.

“The
Coca-Cola Company continues to identify innovative approaches to partnerships
that enable us to stay at the forefront of consumer trends in the beverage
industry,” said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of The Coca-Cola Company.  “Our equity investment in Monster is a capital
efficient way to bolster our participation in the fast-growing and attractive
global energy drinks category.  This
long-term partnership aligns us with a leading energy player globally, brings
financial benefit to our Company and our bottling partners, and supports
broader commercial strategies with our customers to bring total beverage growth
opportunities that will also benefit our core business.”

Kent
added, “We are excited to evolve our long-time partnership. Monster has been an
important part of our global system since 2008, so we have experienced
first-hand Monster’s performance-driven and entrepreneurial culture, proven
success in building and extending the Monster brand and their strong product
innovation pipeline.  We believe this
partnership will create compelling and sustainable value for our system and our
shareowners.”

“The transaction
announced today represents a unique opportunity for Monster and its
shareholders,” said Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Monster.  “We gain enhanced access to The
Coca-Cola Company’s distribution system, the most powerful and extensive system
in the world.  At the same time, we
become The Coca-Cola Company’s exclusive energy play, with a robust portfolio
led by our Monster Energy line and The Coca-Cola Company’s energy brands.  Our business will be bolstered by The
Coca-Cola Company energy brands we will acquire, providing us with complementary
energy product offerings in many geographies, as well as access to new
channels, including vending and specialty accounts,” Sacks said.

“Our agreement
enables us to focus on our core energy business, while leveraging the strength
of The Coca-Cola Company’s powerful distribution and bottling system on a worldwide
scale,” said Hilton H. Schlosberg, Monster’s Vice Chairman and President.  “The goals of both companies’ management teams
are further aligned, with a great enhancement to Monster’s position as one of
the world’s leading energy beverage companies.  We expect the transaction to significantly
accelerate our growth and results of operations internationally, and we plan to
review all options available to return a substantial amount of cash to our
shareholders,” Schlosberg added.

Monster Beverage’s distribution network

Monster Beverage relies on third parties
Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST) doesn’t manufacture and distribute its products. It outsources the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and contract packers. The company does pack some of its products in certain locations—like Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and the US. This ensures that the beverages are produced closer to markets where they’re sold. Also, it brings down the freight costs and transportation-related damages.

Key customers
Monster Beverage mainly sells its products to full-service beverage distributors—like Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc., or CCR, retail grocery and specialty chains like Walmart (WMT), wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers, and the military. In 2013, 63% of net sales were derived from full-service distributors.



Major bottling partners
Monster Beverage has some major distribution agreements with The Coca-Cola Company (KO), CCR, and Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (BUD). The company also signed distribution agreements with bottlers of the Coca-Cola Hellenic group for the distribution of certain Monster Energy brands in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, and Poland. CCR accounted for ~29% of the company’s 2013 net sales.
Monster Beverage’s peer, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS), also depends on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) for the distribution of certain brands. You can have diversified holdings in these companies through the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP).
Partnership with Coca-Cola
In August 2014, Coca-Cola purchased a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage. It agreed to amend their current distribution agreement in the US and Canada to include additional territories and long-term agreements. Through the deal, Monster Beverage will be able to leverage Coca-Cola’s strong distribution network.

History[edit]
Hansen's was founded in 1935.[5] In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label.[6]
The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares.[7]
In April 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled products containing high-fructose corn syrup could not be labeled "natural".[8] Shortly after, Hansen's Natural Corporation announced they had begun using cane sugar instead.[9]
In September 2009, Hansen brand Monster Energy sent a cease and desist letter to Rock Art Brewery, demanding the microbrewery stop selling its new Vermonster beer, drop its pursuit of a federal trademark for the name, and pay Hansen's lawyer fees. This resulted in a boycott of all Hansen products by a few Vermont retailers.[10]
In June 2015 Coca-Cola North America took ownership of Hansen’s juice products and sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Blue Sky sodas, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands.[11]
Products[edit]
Natural soda[edit]
Natural Soda comes in twelve flavors: Original Cola, Ginger Ale, Key Lime Twist, Cherry Vanilla Creme, Grapefruit, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cola, Mandarin Lime, Creamy Root Beer, Raspberry, Mango Orange, and Pomegranate.[12] All Hansen's sodas are made with cane sugar.
Energy drinks[edit]

Energy drinks include Hansen's Natural Energy Pro and Hansen's Energy Diet Red. The Monster Energy brand includes beverages such as Java Monster, Monster Rehab, and Muscle Monster.[13]
Diet soda[edit]
Their Diet Soda is available in ten flavors: Cola, Black Cherry, Peach, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cherry Créme,Tangerine Lime, Ginger Ale, Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate. Hansen's diet soda is sweetened with acesulfame potassium and sucralose. All diet sodas are OU Kosher certified.[5][not in citation given]
Drink mixers[edit]
Monster Beverage sells three flavors of soda mixer: Tonic, Ginger Ale, and Club Soda.
Fruit juices[edit]
The company sells thirteen fruit juices in 64-ounce PET bottles, several of which are available in smaller bottles for kids. These include Apple, Grape, White Grape, Pineapple, Apple Grape, Apple Strawberry, Orange, Cranberry Apple, Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pomegranate, Organic Apple White Grape, Organic Apple Wild Berry and Organic Apple. Hansen's Natural Organic Apple Juice is made solely from concentrates the company obtains from China. Hansen's uses concentrates from China in other varieties of its juices, despite the availability of such juice concentrates made from fruit grown and processed in the United States, which grows an abundance of apples, as well as many of the other fruits used in Hansen's juice products. These juices contain 120% of the United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDA) for Vitamin C (except Pomegranate, which contains 100%).[citation needed]
In 2009, Monster Beverage introduced Hansen's Natural Lo-Cal 64-ounce juice cocktails, in four flavors. They are sweetened with Truvia.
Hansen's fruit juice smoothies contain approximately 25% juice and provide 100% of the recommended daily adult intake of Vitamins A, C, and E. They are packaged in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans.
Juices for children[edit]
Hansen's Juice Blast line of children's juice drinks was launched in conjunction with Costco and sold in Costco stores. Hansen also has a Juice Slam line of children's juice drinks. Both lines are sold in 6.75-ounce boxes.
In May 2001, Hansen's acquired the Junior Juice beverage business.[14] Hansen's Junior Juice is 100% juice, sold in 4.23-ounce cartons and targeted at toddlers and preschoolers. Certain flavors of Junior Juice have calcium added and all flavors contain 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C. The brand was introduced in 1991 by McCain Foods,[15] and sold to the Pasco Beverage Group in 2000[16] before being sold again, to Hansen's. Hansen's replaced the original four mascots, Uncle Froggy, Emily the Mouse, Ronald Rabbit, and Nick the Fox,[17] with Clifford the Big Red Dog.
In July 2008, Hansen's introduced Hansen's Organic Junior Water, in 4.23-ounce packages aimed at children between two and six years old. The Hansen's Organic Junior Water line of flavored water contains 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C and thirty calories per serving. Also in 2008, organic Junior Water was introduced. Hansen's later introduced Coconut Water Twist, containing coconut water,[18] and Garden Twist, a combination of fruits and vegetables, which is the only Junior Juice variant to be sold in bottles.[18]
Other beverages[edit]
Smoothies, Rumba Energy Juice, Energade, and Energy Formula, are minor products. Monster owns Blue Sky Beverage Company, which manufactures several soft drinks. Monster produces the Monster, Lost, and Rumba energy drinks, which were previously distributed in the United States by Anheuser Busch.[19] On November 10, 2008, distribution of the Monster Energy and Monster Java products was turned over to Coca-Cola Enterprises.
In August 2009, Hansen's introduced the SELF Beauty Elixir line, a low-calorie beverage containing vitamins, minerals, natural fruit & botanical extracts, antioxidants and 30% fruit juice. The beverage contains 35 calories and a low amount of sodium per 8-ounce aluminum can.

In 2006, Hansen's introduced a line of iced teas in 16-ounce PET bottles. Some varieties were sweetened with cane sugar and some were unsweetened. Flavors included Lemon Mint, Pomegranate, Ginger, and Tangerine. There were also three flavors of diet green tea soda: Lemon Mint, Ginger and Tangerine. Each bottle of tea contained 75 mg of Epigallocatechin gallate. Hansen's also made tea bags.

History[edit]
Hansen's was founded in 1935.[5] In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his three sons began selling juice to film studios and retailers in Southern California under the Hansen's name. In the 1970s, Tim Hansen (the grandson of Hubert) developed and marketed a variety of sodas and juices, also under the Hansen's label.[6]
The company became Hansen's Juices, and later The Fresh Juice Company of California. The plant that was opened in Los Angeles in 1946 was used until operations were moved to a new plant in Azusa, California in 1993. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1988, and was acquired by the California CoPackers Corporation and renamed Hansen Natural Company. In 1998, the company moved from Anaheim, California to Corona, California. On January 5, 2012, shareholders agreed to change the name of the company from Hansen's Natural to Monster Beverage Corporation, under the new ticker MNST. Shareholders also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 240,000,000 shares from 120,000,000 shares.[7]
In April 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled products containing high-fructose corn syrup could not be labeled "natural".[8] Shortly after, Hansen's Natural Corporation announced they had begun using cane sugar instead.[9]
In September 2009, Hansen brand Monster Energy sent a cease and desist letter to Rock Art Brewery, demanding the microbrewery stop selling its new Vermonster beer, drop its pursuit of a federal trademark for the name, and pay Hansen's lawyer fees. This resulted in a boycott of all Hansen products by a few Vermont retailers.[10]
In June 2015 Coca-Cola North America took ownership of Hansen’s juice products and sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Blue Sky sodas, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands.[11]
Products[edit]
Natural soda[edit]
Natural Soda comes in twelve flavors: Original Cola, Ginger Ale, Key Lime Twist, Cherry Vanilla Creme, Grapefruit, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cola, Mandarin Lime, Creamy Root Beer, Raspberry, Mango Orange, and Pomegranate.[12] All Hansen's sodas are made with cane sugar.
Energy drinks[edit]




Monster Energy Logo


Energy drinks include Hansen's Natural Energy Pro and Hansen's Energy Diet Red. The Monster Energy brand includes beverages such as Java Monster, Monster Rehab, and Muscle Monster.[13]
Diet soda[edit]
Their Diet Soda is available in ten flavors: Cola, Black Cherry, Peach, Kiwi Strawberry, Vanilla Cherry Créme,Tangerine Lime, Ginger Ale, Root Beer, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate. Hansen's diet soda is sweetened with acesulfame potassium and sucralose. All diet sodas are OU Kosher certified.[5][not in citation given]
Drink mixers[edit]
Monster Beverage sells three flavors of soda mixer: Tonic, Ginger Ale, and Club Soda.
Fruit juices[edit]
The company sells thirteen fruit juices in 64-ounce PET bottles, several of which are available in smaller bottles for kids. These include Apple, Grape, White Grape, Pineapple, Apple Grape, Apple Strawberry, Orange, Cranberry Apple, Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pomegranate, Organic Apple White Grape, Organic Apple Wild Berry and Organic Apple. Hansen's Natural Organic Apple Juice is made solely from concentrates the company obtains from China. Hansen's uses concentrates from China in other varieties of its juices, despite the availability of such juice concentrates made from fruit grown and processed in the United States, which grows an abundance of apples, as well as many of the other fruits used in Hansen's juice products. These juices contain 120% of the United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDA) for Vitamin C (except Pomegranate, which contains 100%).[citation needed]
In 2009, Monster Beverage introduced Hansen's Natural Lo-Cal 64-ounce juice cocktails, in four flavors. They are sweetened with Truvia.
Hansen's fruit juice smoothies contain approximately 25% juice and provide 100% of the recommended daily adult intake of Vitamins A, C, and E. They are packaged in 11.5-ounce aluminum cans.
Juices for children[edit]
Hansen's Juice Blast line of children's juice drinks was launched in conjunction with Costco and sold in Costco stores. Hansen also has a Juice Slam line of children's juice drinks. Both lines are sold in 6.75-ounce boxes.
In May 2001, Hansen's acquired the Junior Juice beverage business.[14] Hansen's Junior Juice is 100% juice, sold in 4.23-ounce cartons and targeted at toddlers and preschoolers. Certain flavors of Junior Juice have calcium added and all flavors contain 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C. The brand was introduced in 1991 by McCain Foods,[15] and sold to the Pasco Beverage Group in 2000[16] before being sold again, to Hansen's. Hansen's replaced the original four mascots, Uncle Froggy, Emily the Mouse, Ronald Rabbit, and Nick the Fox,[17] with Clifford the Big Red Dog.
In July 2008, Hansen's introduced Hansen's Organic Junior Water, in 4.23-ounce packages aimed at children between two and six years old. The Hansen's Organic Junior Water line of flavored water contains 100% of the daily recommended allowance of Vitamin C and thirty calories per serving. Also in 2008, organic Junior Water was introduced. Hansen's later introduced Coconut Water Twist, containing coconut water,[18] and Garden Twist, a combination of fruits and vegetables, which is the only Junior Juice variant to be sold in bottles.[18]
Other beverages[edit]
Smoothies, Rumba Energy Juice, Energade, and Energy Formula, are minor products. Monster owns Blue Sky Beverage Company, which manufactures several soft drinks. Monster produces the Monster, Lost, and Rumba energy drinks, which were previously distributed in the United States by Anheuser Busch.[19] On November 10, 2008, distribution of the Monster Energy and Monster Java products was turned over to Coca-Cola Enterprises.
In August 2009, Hansen's introduced the SELF Beauty Elixir line, a low-calorie beverage containing vitamins, minerals, natural fruit & botanical extracts, antioxidants and 30% fruit juice. The beverage contains 35 calories and a low amount of sodium per 8-ounce aluminum can.
Retired products[edit]
Signature Soda[edit]
Hansen's Signature Soda line included Black Cherry, Vanilla Cream, Orange Cream, Ginger Beer, and Sarsaparilla flavors.[5]
Natural and diet tea sodas[edit]
Hansen's Natural and Diet Soda flavors included: Black Cherry, Tangerine, Tropical, Orange Mango, Peach Mango, Peach, Cherry, Cranberry, Clear Root Beer, Vanilla Coffee, Low Cal Wildberry, Low Cal Cola, and Low Cal Creamy Cola.
In 2006, Hansen's introduced a line of iced teas in 16-ounce PET bottles. Some varieties were sweetened with cane sugar and some were unsweetened. Flavors included Lemon Mint, Pomegranate, Ginger, and Tangerine. There were also three flavors of diet green tea soda: Lemon Mint, Ginger and Tangerine. Each bottle of tea contained 75 mg of Epigallocatechin gallate. Hansen's also made tea bags.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
