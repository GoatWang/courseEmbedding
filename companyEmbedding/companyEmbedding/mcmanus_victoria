Victoria McManus, EVP and Chief Strategic Officer
 


 

 




 





 


LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., Oct. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greenbrier Companies (NYSE:   GBX) announced today that Victoria McManus has been named as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, reporting to Chairman and CEO, William A. Furman.  
In this newly created position, Ms. McManus will be responsible for developing and implementing strategic initiatives to diversify and grow the Company's business and to enhance value from the Company's integrated freight car manufacturing, aftermarkets, leasing and services business model.   In addition to these responsibilities, Ms. McManus will oversee executive development efforts, public policy issues and corporate development activities.  Effective upon her appointment as an executive officer of the Company, Ms. McManus resigned as a member of Greenbrier's Board of Directors, a position she has held since 2009. 
Ms. McManus' credentials include over twenty years' experience in the finance industry, with emphasis on the rail equipment sector.  Ms. McManus was head of Babcock & Brown's North American Rail Group, from its founding in 1999 until mid-2008. During this tenure, the Rail Group raised significant capital from the European and Asian markets for investment in rail assets placed under operating leases, and became a major participant in the rail equipment marketplace. Before joining Babcock & Brown, Ms. McManus was an executive with The CIT Group for ten years. Her last position at CIT was President of the Rail Division, where she changed the strategic direction of the business to a full service platform to provide both financial and equipment leasing services to the rail freight industry. 
"We are delighted to have Victoria McManus join the senior management team at Greenbrier," said Mr. Furman.  "Victoria was instrumental in WL Ross & Co.'s investment in Greenbrier in 2009 and has added tremendous value as a director of Greenbrier since this time.  I am sure Victoria will add considerable value as a senior member of our management team.  She is a well-known leader in our industry, and has a keen understanding of the major drivers for our business.  In her work on strategic planning for the Company's future, Victoria will focus on business development, both externally through potential expansion of our core business competencies, and internally through organic growth, talent development and coaching.  Victoria is a dynamic executive and a change agent.  I am confident she will help us to continue to grow and diversify our business," concluded Furman. 
Greenbrier, (www.gbrx.com), headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon, is a leading supplier of transportation equipment and services to the railroad industry. Greenbrier builds new railroad freight cars in our 4 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Mexico and marine barges at our U.S. manufacturing facility.  Greenbrier also sells reconditioned wheel sets and provides wheel services at 9 locations throughout the U.S.  We recondition, manufacture and sell railcar parts at 4 U.S. sites.  Greenbrier is a 50/50 joint venture partner with Watco Companies, LLC in GBW Railcar Services, LLC which repairs and refurbishes freight cars at 33 locations across North America, including 12 tank car repair and maintenance facilities certified by the Association of American Railroads. Greenbrier builds new railroad freight cars and refurbishes freight cars for the European market through our operations in Poland. Greenbrier owns approximately 9,300 railcars, and performs management services for approximately 260,000 railcars.

A 31-year-old Chicago man has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, allegedly strangling her to death during a late-night fight on Tuesday.Daniel Kralik is being held on a $1 million bond in the relation to the slaying of Victoria McManus, 26, who he had been dating for two years.The couple had been living together for the past two months at her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street, Assistant State’s Attorney Alexandra Molesky told The Chicago Sun-Times.Two weeks ago, the couple got into a fight because McManus, 26, had a relationship with another man, Molesky said.  





Confessed: Daniel Kralik called 911 and admitted that he had strangled Victoria McManus after an argument at the apartment they shared in Chicago on Tuesday night  





Gone too soon: Victoria A. McManus was found dead in her home in the 1200 block of North Rockwell Street in Chicago on Tuesday night
 
 Kralik initially planned to move out and stay with friends, but the couple reconciled and continued living together.On Tuesday, the couple got into another fight at McManus’ apartment, authorities said.McManus left her residence while Kralik went to a friend’s place until he 'cooled off', Molesky said.Instead, Kralik stayed at McManus’ apartment and when she returned home the couple got into another argument in her bedroom, Molesky said.During the argument, Kralik allegedly strangled McManus with his hands.The roommate heard the muffled sounds of an argument and a brief struggle, Molesky said.Kralik called 911 and admitted that he strangled McManus after an argument.Police responded about 12:50 a.m. and arrested Kralik, authorities said.McManus was declared dead at the scene.  





McManus is believed to have recently started a relationship with another man, infuriating her boyfriend, who has now been charged with her murder
 McManus was found lying on her bed with an abrasion on her forehead and a pillow covering her face, Molesky said.An autopsy confirmed McManus died of strangulation, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.Kralik appeared in court wearing Thursday a white plastic jumpsuit because his clothes were taken as evidence.Judge Adam Bourgeois ordered Kralik held on $1 million bond and issued a next court date of June 4.Kralik, whose parents live in Montana, had been working at an aquarium and fish store and has no criminal history, his public defender said.Police listed his address as the 2200 block of West Iowa Street.

“Wonderfully Drinkable” Gambero Rosso
When Gambero Rosso’s annual wine guide drops, the Italian wine world stops, as winemakers scan the influential Italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes. Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is a perennial Gambero favorite, having earned multiple “Due Bicchieri” (“Two Glasses”) honors in addition to praise as a “sincere, wonderfully drinkable wine.” The Wine Access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more, and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent 2015 vintage by the case. 
The land of Badia di Morrona in the picturesque hills between Florence and Pisa was first worked by 11th century Benedictine monks. Today it is owned by Count Gaslini Alberti, who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past 50 years, outfitting winemaker Corrado Dal Piaz with a refurbished facility, enlarged cellars, and new casks and barrels.
Dal Piaz is notoriously hard on the Badia’s 282 acres of grapes, which soak up the sun on south- and south-eastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone. He tightened spacing in the vines, orchestrating a Darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skin-to-juice ratio. The result is Sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity.
2015’s long growing season allowed temperamental Sangiovese to reach rare, almost perfectly uniform maturity. The vines stretched deep underground, sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil, putting out a dark, crushed-red-fruit Sangiovese, infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins.
If you’re looking for vibrancy in your top-class Chianti, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything quite like this luscious 2015. At $13.99 (and as Gambero Rosso would advise), this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation.








Tasting Notes



WineAccess Travel Log
The 2015 Badia di Morrona Chianti I Sodi del Paretaio is bright ruby to the edge, with a fabulous nose of wild berry, blue flower, and tangy spices. Juicy and high-toned on the attack, with sneaky weight and supple texture. This is textbook Chianti.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
