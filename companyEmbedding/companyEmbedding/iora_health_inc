  "Humana’s strong Medicare capabilities and        Iora’s passionate focus on patient care allows us to collaborate in        order to offer our Humana members a health care that is transformational        with a focus on getting and keeping these member healthy." 



PHOENIX & DENVER & SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To offer patient-focused care for Medicare beneficiaries, Iora 
      Health and Humana 
      Inc. (NYSE: HUM) have teamed up to add five additional Iora Primary 
      Care practices to Humana’s Medicare Advantage Plan networks in Arizona, 
      Colorado and Washington state.
    

      Humana is adding these new Iora Primary Care practice locations to its 
      network in an effort to improve access to care and quality of care while 
      increasing patients’ ability to manage their own care to improve their 
      health and well-being. The new practices, operated by Iora Health, 
      accept certain Medicare Advantage plans administered by Humana and do 
      not accept Medicare Advantage plans administered by other carriers.
    

      Humana’s value-based relationships with providers, like Iora, are aimed 
      at transforming health care by offering proactive, personalized care for 
      Medicare beneficiaries. Humana and Iora strive to meet monthly to review 
      member cases and issues. This helps ensure that members aren’t simply 
      treated for what ails them, but are also provided with a more 
      comprehensive team working on a plan to keep them on the path to their 
      best health and ensuring they receive a health care experience designed 
      with their needs foremost in mind.
    

      The new Iora Health® Primary Care practices are located at:
    


        Arizona: 9124 E. Main Street, Mesa, AZ 85207
      

        Arizona: 5110 E. Southern Ave., Mesa, AZ 85206
      

        Colorado: 1080 S. Sable Blvd., Aurora, CO 80012
      

        Colorado: 8246 W. Bowles Ave., Bldg. 1, Unit T, Littleton, CO 80123
      

        Washington state: 1414 S. 324th Street, Ste. B207, Federal 
        Way, WA 98003
      


      The Iora practices will start seeing patients on Oct. 3, 2016.
    

      “At Iora we believe that relationships are the missing link in health 
      care. However, we find that Medicare-eligible patients rarely receive 
      enough time with their doctor, or the support and tools necessary to 
      cope with a complex health care system,” said Duncan Reece, General 
      Manager and Vice President for Iora Health. “In just the first year, our 
      Net Promoter Scores® - at 90% - are consistently higher than 
      most consumer brands¹ and hospitalization rates declined by 40 percent 
      for our patients who have been engaged for at least one year².”
    

      Iora Primary Care practices focus on a patient-first experience, which 
      is tailored to the needs of each patient. Iora® offers:
    


        Smaller panel sizes than the industry average so that doctors can 
        spend more time listening to patients’ needs.
      

        Integrated care team that includes doctors, Health Coaches, and 
        Behavioral Health Specialists, who all help guide patients through the 
        complex health system and ensure their care addresses the whole 
        person, not just symptoms.
      

        Convenience: 24/7 access to doctors by phone for urgent needs, 
        same/next day appointments, onsite labs, and locations with free 
        parking.
      

        Access to Iora’s Chirp technology, a proprietary medical record that 
        patients can use to schedule appointments, access their records, and 
        email with the care team.
      

        Close collaboration with in-network specialists with whom Iora has 
        built relationships.
      

        Staff familiarity with the member’s Medicare Advantage insurance, 
        since the practice only accepts Medicare Advantage plans administered 
        by Humana, which simplifies billing issues/questions.
      


      This is the third consecutive year Iora Health and Humana have teamed 
      up. The organizations first teamed up in 2014 
      and again in 2015. 
      The new practices mean that Humana Medicare Advantage members have 
      access to Iora®’s 16 primary care practices – five in Phoenix 
      metro, two in Tucson, five in Denver and four in Seattle.
    

      “We are seeing encouraging results in our Humana Medicare Advantage 
      members who go to an Iora Primary Care practice. That’s why we are 
      excited to partner with Iora for the third straight year to offer our 
      members access to Iora’s primary care practices in more areas of 
      Arizona, Colorado and Washington state,” said Mark El-Tawil, West 
      Division Leader for Humana. “Humana’s strong Medicare capabilities and 
      Iora’s passionate focus on patient care allows us to collaborate in 
      order to offer our Humana members a health care that is transformational 
      with a focus on getting and keeping these member healthy.”
    

      In 2014, on average, Humana 
      Medicare Advantage members served by physicians under value-based 
      care arrangements experienced fewer ER visits and hospital admissions; 
      higher screening rates, including those for colorectal cancer (+7 
      percent) and breast cancer (+6 percent); and healthier outcomes compared 
      to members who were treated by physicians with standard Medicare 
      Advantage reimbursement arrangements.
    

      As of June 30, 2016, Humana has 1.7 million individual Medicare 
      Advantage members and 200,000 commercial members who are cared for by 
      48,200 primary care providers, in more than 900 value-based 
      relationships across 43 states and Puerto Rico.
    

      As of June 30, 2016, approximately 61 percent of Humana individual 
      Medicare Advantage members are seeing providers who are in value-based 
      payment relationships with Humana. Humana’s goal is to have 75 percent 
      of individual Medicare Advantage members using providers in value-based 
      payment models by the end of 2017. For more information, visit humana.com/accountable-care 
      or humana.com/valuebasedcare.

READ his STORY

×
As a Health Coach, what makes me happiest is developing a relationship with my patients. I love watching them grow, supporting them when they need to be supported and letting them go when it’s time. Helping people change for the better feels amazing.
Getting to know my patients is key to this job. With Gideon, it’s so much more than setting goals for his weight. It’s understanding what else is happening in his life — like his new marriage or the stress of 60-hour weeks as a carpenter — so we can tackle it together.
I want my patients to see it’s okay to say ‘I need help.’ As Health Coaches, we’re here for the physical needs, but also for their mental and social health. I always wanted to be a doctor as a kid, but now I truly feel like I have my dream job!
See more stories ▶













It’s a whole new patient experience.
Iora changes primary care as we know it. Our care team, which includes a dedicated advocate for each patient, works together to treat the whole person. We see people when they’re sick, but also when they’re well, so that we can keep them healthy. Here, the environment is caring and patients have a voice. It’s our job to give them everything they need to live happier and healthier lives.













Our medical team empowers the individual.
A team of a doctor, nurse and a Health Coach works with each person. We set goals with the patients, enabling them to become active participants in their own well-being. We know people by name, but more importantly by their dreams, fears and challenges.
                      











Health Coaches are the connection.
Our Health Coaches are relationship builders between the patients and their care teams. They are screened and hired for their ability to connect deeply with people because our Health Coaches are more than caregivers. They are confidants, cheerleaders, and friends.












Fully integrating behavioral health
We believe it’s easier for patients to manage their lives when mental health is also prioritized and seen as integral to one’s overall health. At Iora, our patients can access their own behavioral health specialist in the comfort and privacy of their doctors’ office. Our specialists provide short-term counseling, assessments and referrals, as well as consultation to other team members, all within the scope of primary care.












Our technology is inspired by our care.
Most medical record systems prioritize billing first, patients second. Ours is designed around patients, period. We created our collaborative care platform to support caring for the whole person, and we’re always improving it based on feedback from our care teams and their patients — recent updates include patient access to their own records and a place to share notes. We’ve also built a tool to manage not only an individual’s health, but an entire population’s.
                      











                           
Say goodbye to paying by transaction.
Doing the right thing for our patients extends to our payment model too. We’ve moved away from a transaction-based model to one based on care. Now, care teams are free to do what’s best to treat our patients rather than what the system deems reimbursable. Because not all aspects of caring have a billing code.
                      











We find partners that make it happen.
For our model to work, we need partners who share our belief in a better way to take care of people. Together, we open practices, understanding that high quality primary care is the solution for happier, healthier and more engaged patients. And in the long run, this is what leads to lower costs. Learn more

READ her STORY

×
I love how welcoming Iora is. Everyone gets to know you personally. And being from Honduras, I was especially glad to meet my Health Coach Brendalys, who also speaks Spanish. She made me feel comfortable, and that was my first step in opening up.
When I first saw Brendalys, I was dealing with a very personal loss. It was so comforting to have someone to talk to — I never had that kind of support before at a doctor’s office. She took the time to understand me, so that she could help me start to get healthier.
As my husband [also an Iora patient] says, Iora is like family. They’re excited to see you when you come in, they know about your life, they check to see what’s happening when you’re not there. There’s really no comparison. I’m very happy here.

We’re changing health care from the ground up.
We believe better health care starts with better primary care. Our simple yet radically different approach to restoring humanity to health care is three-fold: Team-based care that puts the patient first, a payment system based on care, not billing codes and technology built around people, not process.

To put all this into action, we find organizations that share our vision and together, we open practices.
                      











Our team is passionate about making a difference.
Everyone at Iora is committed to helping people live their happiest, healthiest lives. We’re product developers, operations managers, physicians, analysts and more. Our Boston headquarters (affectionately called The Nest) provides the technical, operations and staffing support for our practices across the country.

 Meet our team









                          


Our story is made up of theirs.
The relationships between our doctors, nurses, Health Coaches, patients and the team that supports our practices truly tell the Iora story. A Health Coach who was also a translator for a patient. A doctor who found working as a team meant more time for the individual. A sponsor who got better health care for his workers, for less. Hear from them, in their own words.

Jennie Natenshon, Director, Talent & Culture, Iora
READ her STORY

×
After getting my Master’s in Public Health, I wanted something bigger, to do something for someone besides myself. When I found Iora, I thought ‘This place really exists? People are working like this?’ It gave me hope!
I get to help patients by finding the best people to care for them. It’s an honor to work with team members who have such high hopes and dreams. There’s a respect and appreciation for everyone who works here. We’re all needed to do what we do.
This isn’t just a job. It’s a way of seeing the world. It’s an answer to a question I asked for a long time: Where can I make an impact? Many people we talk to know they want to make a difference but aren’t sure how. This is a place where we can build something together.

This is why you’re right for Iora.
We’re looking for people like you. People who understand that the current health care system needs to be reimagined. Maybe you don’t even have a medical background. But you believe in making a difference. And this is a place you can. Search job openings












You’re a little different. And we are too.
We’re passionate. Quirky. Idealistic. Empathetic. Honest. We believe learning isn’t just professional; it’s personal. Through things like daily huddles, weekly educational hours, cross-team pollination and company-wide retreats, you’ll grow in your individual role while becoming part of the Iora family as a whole.












We’ll let our team tell you themselves!
Who better to talk about working here than the people who actually work here? We created an entire book called From the Ground Up, where people in all different roles talk about their experiences at Iora and tell their stories that reflect our values in actions. Check out the book

Margarita, patient, Iora Primary Care, Dorchester & Burlington, MA
READ her STORY

×
I love how welcoming Iora is. Everyone gets to know you personally. And being from Honduras, I was especially glad to meet my Health Coach Brendalys, who also speaks Spanish. She made me feel comfortable, and that was my first step in opening up.
When I first saw Brendalys, I was dealing with a very personal loss. It was so comforting to have someone to talk to — I never had that kind of support before at a doctor’s office. She took the time to understand me, so that she could help me start to get healthier.
As my husband [also an Iora patient] says, Iora is like family. They’re excited to see you when you come in, they know about your life, they check to see what’s happening when you’re not there. There’s really no comparison. I’m very happy here.

We’re changing health care from the ground up.
We believe better health care starts with better primary care. Our simple yet radically different approach to restoring humanity to health care is three-fold: Team-based care that puts the patient first, a payment system based on care, not billing codes and technology built around people, not process.

To put all this into action, we find organizations that share our vision and together, we open practices.
                      











Our team is passionate about making a difference.
Everyone at Iora is committed to helping people live their happiest, healthiest lives. We’re product developers, operations managers, physicians, analysts and more. Our Boston headquarters (affectionately called The Nest) provides the technical, operations and staffing support for our practices across the country.

 Meet our team









                          


Our story is made up of theirs.
The relationships between our doctors, nurses, Health Coaches, patients and the team that supports our practices truly tell the Iora story. A Health Coach who was also a translator for a patient. A doctor who found working as a team meant more time for the individual. A sponsor who got better health care for his workers, for less. Hear from them, in their own words.

Mike Jeudy, Health Coach, Iora Primary Care, Dorchester & Burlington, MA
READ his STORY

×
As a Health Coach, what makes me happiest is developing a relationship with my patients. I love watching them grow, supporting them when they need to be supported and letting them go when it’s time. Helping people change for the better feels amazing.
Getting to know my patients is key to this job. With Gideon, it’s so much more than setting goals for his weight. It’s understanding what else is happening in his life — like his new marriage or the stress of 60-hour weeks as a carpenter — so we can tackle it together.
I want my patients to see it’s okay to say ‘I need help.’ As Health Coaches, we’re here for the physical needs, but also for their mental and social health. I always wanted to be a doctor as a kid, but now I truly feel like I have my dream job!
See more stories ▶













It’s a whole new patient experience.
Iora changes primary care as we know it. Our care team, which includes a dedicated advocate for each patient, works together to treat the whole person. We see people when they’re sick, but also when they’re well, so that we can keep them healthy. Here, the environment is caring and patients have a voice. It’s our job to give them everything they need to live happier and healthier lives.













Our medical team empowers the individual.
A team of a doctor, nurse and a Health Coach works with each person. We set goals with the patients, enabling them to become active participants in their own well-being. We know people by name, but more importantly by their dreams, fears and challenges.
                      











Health Coaches are the connection.
Our Health Coaches are relationship builders between the patients and their care teams. They are screened and hired for their ability to connect deeply with people because our Health Coaches are more than caregivers. They are confidants, cheerleaders, and friends.












Fully integrating behavioral health
We believe it’s easier for patients to manage their lives when mental health is also prioritized and seen as integral to one’s overall health. At Iora, our patients can access their own behavioral health specialist in the comfort and privacy of their doctors’ office. Our specialists provide short-term counseling, assessments and referrals, as well as consultation to other team members, all within the scope of primary care.












Our technology is inspired by our care.
Most medical record systems prioritize billing first, patients second. Ours is designed around patients, period. We created our collaborative care platform to support caring for the whole person, and we’re always improving it based on feedback from our care teams and their patients — recent updates include patient access to their own records and a place to share notes. We’ve also built a tool to manage not only an individual’s health, but an entire population’s.
                      











                           
Say goodbye to paying by transaction.
Doing the right thing for our patients extends to our payment model too. We’ve moved away from a transaction-based model to one based on care. Now, care teams are free to do what’s best to treat our patients rather than what the system deems reimbursable. Because not all aspects of caring have a billing code.
                      











We find partners that make it happen.
For our model to work, we need partners who share our belief in a better way to take care of people. Together, we open practices, understanding that high quality primary care is the solution for happier, healthier and more engaged patients. And in the long run, this is what leads to lower costs. Learn more
