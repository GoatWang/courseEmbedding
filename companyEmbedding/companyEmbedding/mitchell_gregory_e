Abstract
Greenwald, Banaji and Nosek (2015) present a reanalysis of the meta-analysis by Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard and Tetlock (2013) that examined the effect sizes of Implicit Association Tests designed to predict racial and ethnic discrimination. We discuss points of agreement and disagreement with respect to methods used to synthesize the IAT studies, and we correct an error by Greenwald et al. that obscures a key contribution of our meta-analysis. In the end, all of the meta-analyses converge on the conclusion that, across diverse methods of coding and analyzing the data, IAT scores are not good predictors of ethnic or racial discrimination and explain, at most, small fractions of the variance in discriminatory behavior in controlled laboratory settings. The thought experiments presented by Greenwald et al. go well beyond the lab to claim systematic IAT effects in noisy real-world settings, but these hypothetical exercises depend crucially on untested and arguably untenable assumptions. 



Keywords: implicit bias, Implicit Association Test, prejudice, discrimination

Description










Scholastic’s downloadable worksheets for students offer a varied selection of tasks that require reading for meaning through many fun and strategic activities. The rich content of our title-specific blackline masters incorporates writing exercises, graphic organizers, deductive reasoning, critical thinking, vocabulary development, and much, much more. Through innovative exercises, students will enjoy a range of activities that require them to engage in post-reading reflections that include but are not limited to understanding character development, imagining new endings, connecting with text-based information, plus a focus on important age-appropriate reading strategies such as summarizing,  comparing/contrasting, problem solving, synthesizing, determining cause and effect and many others. From phonics to fluency, the Scholastic downloadable worksheets offer meaningful engagement  for students in grades K-12.  Now available for a special selection of our most popular fiction and nonfiction paperbacks. Perfect for a learning center activity, skill reinforcement, take-home, informal self-assessment, and monitoring independent reading.






Standards:
RL.1.5. Explain major differences between books that tell stories and books that give information, drawing on a wide reading of a range of text types.RL.1.5.
