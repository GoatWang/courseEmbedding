Joe Zekoski

Senior Vice President, Global Operations and Chief Technical Officer 
The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company













Joe Zekoski was named Senior Vice President, Global Operations and Chief Technical Officer for The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in August 2016. Prior to that he had served as Senior Vice President and Chief Technical Officer since 2015. 
In this role, he is responsible for providing corporate leadership in the strategic areas of technology, supply chain, logistics, procurement, manufacturing, engineering and the quality of Goodyear’s products.

Zekoski, who had served as Interim Chief Technical Officer since 2012, began his career with Goodyear in 1979 as a commercial truck tire engineer in Akron, Ohio. He then took leadership positions in commercial truck tire development in Luxembourg and in Akron. Zekoski gained experience in consumer tires when he was assigned as Chief Engineer of tire development for the Asian original equipment manufacturers. Zekoski has also held many other leadership roles within Goodyear’s technical organizations, including customer engineering, light truck tire development and North America product development. His business leadership experience encompasses North America’s retread business, as well as the molded products and air spring businesses in the Engineered Products Division. From 2006 through 2008, Zekoski led Goodyear’s Innovation Center in Luxembourg. He served as Vice President of Global Product Development and Innovation Center Operations from 2008 until 2015.
Zekoski has a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics from the U.S. Air Force Academy and a Master of Business Administration degree from California State College, Dominguez Hills. He lives in Kent, Ohio and is married with two children and four grandchildren.
