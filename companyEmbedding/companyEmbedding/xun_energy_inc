											On August 31, 2012, the Company acquired 30 oil and gas well locations in Venango County, Pennsylvania with an option to acquire an additional 15 oil and gas locations. Work commenced on the first 5 oil well locations on the Rice lease in Venango, County, Pennsylvania, USA in March  2013 and as of February 28, 2014 the roads and drill pads were constructed, and Rice #15 was drilled to a target depth of 1,050'. Drilling samples and observations confirmed intersecting oil bearing lenses. On September 16, 2013 the Company's operator, Vencedor Energy Partners (VEP), completed the nuclear wire line log on Rice #15 on the Rise Lease, in Venango County, PA. Verbal reports from the logging crew and staff on site were very positive when the logging tool pulled out of the well bore was covered with crude oil. On September  25, 2013 the Company's operator, Vencedor Energy Partners (VEP), reported the analysis of the wire-line log on Rice #15 on the Rise Lease, Venango County, PA. VEP reported the following:
											

The Venango-First has two separated lenses, one is about 6 feet, 762'-766', and another 9 foot section, 788'-797', and both have decent porosity. The sand thickness has developed at this location along with its oil saturations. The upper and lower lenses both have a fair to good oil show.
The Venango-Second has 16 feet of formation on the bottom lens, 916'-932', with good porosity and saturation and another 4 feet above it, 908'-912' that's producible with lesser values. The porosity on the lower lens has a fair to excellent show of oil with a poorer oil show in the upper lens portion. 
VEP recommended the balance of the infrastructure on the Rice Lease be completed first. After the infrastructure is installed, then Rice #15 well should be completed for production. 


											On February 4, 2014, four of the five drilling permits on the Rice lease expired. The Operator, VEP, initiated the process to renew the four expired permits. The process for obtaining the permits may take 60 days or longer to obtain from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.  
											
											On April 28, 2014, the Department of Environmental Protection, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania issued well permits for the Rice #3, #5, #6 and #14 to drill 4 oil wells on the Rice lease.

ASSIGNMENT

In oil and gas usage, assignment is a transfer of a property or an interest in an oil or gas property; most commonly, the transfer of an oil or gas lease. The 
																assignor does the transferring and the assignee receives the interest of property.




CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION

Pressure from the reservoir forces the hydrocarbons (crude oil) from the pores in the formation, and moves them to the wellbore. A downhole pump connected by 
																sucker rod to a pump jack artificially lifts the crude oil from the bottom of the wellbore to the top of the wellhead and into a collection tank.
														





DEVELOPMENT OFFSET DRILLING

Offset drilling program consists of drilling new wells within a 
																proven and producing property. Well locations are selected by geologists based on known and historical data from producing oil and gas wells within the property or adjoining properties.





DOWN HOLE PUMP OR BOTTOM HOLE PUMP

Any of the rod pumps, high-pressure liquid pumps, or centrifugal pumps located at or near the bottom of the well and used to lift the well fluids.





DRILLING RIG

A drilling rig is a machine, which creates holes (usually called boreholes) and/or shafts in the ground. 
																Drilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill oil wells, or natural gas extraction wells.





FARMIN AGREEMENT

An agreement between operators whereby the owner (farmer) not wanting to drill a property agrees to assign all or part to the operator (farmee) desiring to 
																drill; farmee assumes the obligation to drill one or more wells on the property to earn the assignment.





FRACTURING

The pumping of crude oil, diesel, water, or chemical into a reservoir with such force that the reservoir rock is broken and results in greater flow of oil or 
																gas from the reservoir.





GAS WELL

A well that produces natural gas, which is not associated with crude oil.





LANDMAN

The individual who negotiates oil and gas leases with mineral owners, cures title defects, and negotiates with other companies on agreements concerning the lease.





LANDOWNER

The person who generally owns all or part of the minerals under his lands and is entitled to lease the same.





LEASE

(1) A legal instrument executed by a mineral owner granting exclusive right to another to explore, drill, and produce oil and gas from a piece of land; (2) 
																Used in conjunction with the actual location of a well(s) or unit.





LEASEHOLD

An Oil and Gas property that is leased from the land owner for a royalty based on production of oil and gas from the property as developed by the leasee.





LESSEE

The person who receives the lease, sometimes called the tenant.





LESSOR

The person giving the lease, sometimes called grantor or landlord.





NET REVENUE INTEREST

The share of revenue, expressed in fractions or decimals, accruing to the working interest after deducting all lease burdens (royalty, overriding royalty, or 
																similar burden).





OFFSET WELL

(1) A well drilled on the next location to the original well. The distance from the first well to the offset well depends upon spacing regulations 
																and whether the original well produces oil or gas. (2) A well drilled on one tract of land to prevent the Drainage of oil or gas to an adjoining tract where a well is being drilled or is already producing.
														





OIL & GAS LEASE

A contract between mineral owner, otherwise known as the lessor and a company or working interest owner, otherwise known as the lessee in which 
																the lessor grants the lessee the right to explore, drill and produce oil, gas and other minerals for a specified primary term and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other minerals are being produced in paying quantities. This
														lease gives the lessee a working interest. The oil and gas lease is granted in exchange for royalty payments to the lessor. It is simply a "ticket to hunt".





OIL WELL

A well that produces crude oil, which is not associated with natural gas.





OPERATOR

Company which operates an Oil and Gas Lease, either on its own behalf, or, if a member of a consortium, on behalf of Lessee’s. Takes primary responsibility 
																for day-to-day operations for an activity (exploration, development, or production) on the Oil and Gas Lease.





OVERRIDE ROYALTY

An overriding royalty interest can be assigned from a working interest owner to a person. An overriding royalty interest may also be generated by someone who 
																has leased a person’s minerals and then assigns their leasehold to a working interest owner and retains an override. Neither a royalty nor overriding royalty interest owner pays any well costs associated with the drilling,
														recompletion or workover of a well. They also do not pay any of the monthly operating expenses associated with a well. Like mineral and royalty owners, the owner of overriding royalty interests receives a portion of the 
																income from the production of oil and gas. The main difference is that the owner of an overriding royalty does not own the minerals under the ground, only proceeds from the production of minerals. Once the lease has expired
														and production has ceased, the overriding royalty interest expires. Conversely, the owners of minerals and royalties maintain their ownership after production ceases.





PLUG

To fill a well’s borehole with cement or other impervious material to prevent the flow of water, gas or oil from one strata to another when a well is 
																abandoned; to screw a metal plug into a pipeline to shut off drainage or to divert the stream of oil to a connecting line to stop the flow of oil or gas.





PLUGGING A WELL

To fill up the borehole of an abandoned well with mud and cement to prevent the flow of water or oil from one strata to another or to the surface. In the 
																industry’s early years, wells were often improperly plugged or left open. Modern practice requires that an abandoned well be properly and securely plugged.





PROPERTY

Land covered by the Oil and Gas Lease.





PRODUCTION

The process of extracting crude oil or natural gas from the underground formations to the surface via natural reservoir pressures or by artificial lift.





PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the 
																required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well, and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means
														not involving a well.





PROVED RESERVES

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable 
																certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing
														the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must
														have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and 
																limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis
														of available geoscience and engineering data. (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience,
														engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the 
																potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the
														higher contact with reasonable certainty. (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved 
																classification when: (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an 
																analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for 
																development by all necessary parties and entities, including government entities.





PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells 
																where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when 
																drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only
														if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped
														reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same 
																reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.





PUMPER

An employee of an operator who is responsible for gauging the oil and gas sold off the leases he has been assigned and who is also responsible for maintaining 
																and reporting the daily production.





PUMP JACK

A pump jack (nodding donkey, pumping unit, horsehead pump, beam pump, sucker rod pump (SRP), grasshopper pump, thirsty bird, jack pump) is the over ground 
																drive for a reciprocating piston pump in an oil well. It is used to mechanically lift liquid out of the well if there is not enough bottom hole pressure for the liquid to flow all the way to the surface.





RESERVOIR

A subsurface, porous, permeable or naturally fractured rock body in which oil or gas are stored. Most reservoir rocks are limestones, dolomites, sandstones, 
																or a combination of these. The four basic types of hydrocarbon reservoirs are oil, volatile oil, dry gas, and gas condensate. An oil reservoir generally contains three fluids—gas, oil, and water—with oil the dominant product.
														In the typical oil reservoir, these fluids become vertically segregated because of their different densities. Gas, the lightest, occupies the upper part of the reservoir rocks; water, the lower part; and oil, the intermediate
														section. In addition to its occurrence as a cap or in solution, gas may accumulate independently of the oil; if so, the reservoir is called a gas reservoir. Associated with the gas, in most instances, are salt water and some
														oil. Volatile oil reservoirs are exceptional in that during early production, they are mostly productive of light oil plus gas, but, as depletion occurs, production can become almost totally completely gas. Volatile oils are
														usually good candidates for pressure maintenance, which can result in increased reserves. In the typical dry gas reservoir, natural gas exists only as a gas and production is only gas plus fresh water that condenses from the
														flow stream reservoir. In a gas condensate reservoir, the hydrocarbons may exist as a gas, but, when brought to the surface, some of the heavier hydrocarbons condense and become a liquid.





ROD (SUCKER ROD)

Steel rods that are screwed together to form a “string” that connects the pump inside a well’s tubing down hole to the pump jack on the surface; pumping rods.





ROYALTY

A percentage interest in the value of production from a lease that is retained and paid to the mineral rights owner. The share of the production or proceeds 
																therefrom reserved to the lessor under the terms of the mineral lease. Normally, royalty interests are free of all costs of production (as distinguished from costs of marketing) except production taxes, and is established
														in the lease by reserving a royalty, which is usually, expressed fractionally (i.e. 1/8).





SERVICE RIG

A service rig is a piece of equipment, which is used for servicing wells such as oil and gas wells. Service rigs are not intended for drilling, but for the 
																completion of other tasks related to operating oil and gas wells. Some companies, which operate wells, maintain their own service rigs, while others prefer to rent them because they can be very expensive. Specialty crews
														run service rigs when they are needed for routine maintenance and emergencies.





SWAB

A tool, which is lowered down the pipe on a wire line. The "swab" is then pulled out of the hole. As it travels up the pipe, rubber elements expand so that 
																the fluid in the pipe is trapped above the swab and pushed to the surface. This operation is necessary when the formation pressure is not high enough to blow the fluids in the pipe to the surface.





TOP HEAD LEASE

A lease acquired while a mineral lease to the same property is still in effect. The top head lease (held by a different company) replaces the existing lease 
																when it expires or is terminated.





TUBING

Relatively small-diameter pipe that is run into a well to serve as a conduit for the passage of oil and gas to the surface.





WELLBORE

The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for oil or gas production on a completed well. Also called Well or Borehole.





WELLHEAD

The equipment at the surface of a well used to control the pressure; the point at which the hydrocarbons and water exit the ground.





WELL LOCATION

Well Location is defined as a circle having a radius of the well bore centre, to a depth as allowed in the Master Lease. Does not includes rights to minerals 
																beyond the circle of the radius of the well bore centre.





WILDCAT WELL

An exploration well that is drilled to an unproven reservoir from which no oil or gas has been produced in the nearby area. A "rank" wildcat is drilled in an area distant from previous drilling.





WORKING INTEREST

The right granted to the lessee of a property to explore for and to produce and own oil, gas, or other minerals. The working interest owners bear the 
																exploration, development, and operating costs on a cash, penalty, or carried basis.





WORKOVER

Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. A workover may be performed to stimulate the well, remove sand, or wax from 
																the wellbore, to mechanically repair the well, or for other reasons.
															

														The performance of one or more of a variety of remedial operations on a producing oil well to try to 
																increase production. Examples of workover jobs are deepening, plugging back, pulling resetting liners, and squeeze cementing.

2007 - 2010
											Xun Energy, Inc. (Xun Energy) was incorporated on December 20, 2007 in the State of Nevada; it’s name, Real Value Estates, Inc., was changed to Xun Energy in July, 2010. 
											
											Prior to February 2010, the corporate entity was focused on services to the residential mortgage foreclosure market. The Company was not successful with this endeavor and new management determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company to change its business model and focus its further operations in the field of diverse energy production and storage, a business most closely associated with new management.  After several privately negotiated stock sales, a change in control and new officers and directors were appointed.  
											
											In March 2010, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Global Power and Water Industries, Inc. (“GPWI”). Management’s goal was to pursue emerging opportunities in the field of solar energy. The initial focus would be the development and installation of high-efficiency concentrator solar cell arrays, thermal electric technologies and advanced tracking systems in China. The Agreement was terminated by the Company in May 2010 without liability.  In the future, the Company plans to re-visit emerging opportunities in energy and energy storage.

2010 - 2011
											In July 2010, to better represent future Company business lines and position the Company and to pursue new business opportunities, the Board of Directors approved a name change for the Company.  The name change would assist shareholders, prospective investors, and analysts in understanding the new business model and eliminate any confusion with respect to prior activities. The Company changed its name to Xun Energy, Inc.  It increased the number of authorized shares of its common stock from one hundred million to five billion. We also forward split our outstanding common stock on an 80:1 basis. Management believed that with the name change, recapitalization, and forward split, the Company was better positioned to pursue other business opportunities.  
				
											On December 9, 2010, the Company executed a Letter of Intent with Global Energy Acquisitions, LLC (“GEA”) which provided in part for the Company to acquire from GEA a 51% gross royalty interest in up to 500 producing oil wells in Kentucky. Closing of the transaction was subject to completion by each party of their own due diligence and the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement. After further review, GEA elected to terminate the Letter of Intent and neither party would be under any contractual obligation to the other with respect to closing the transaction. 
				
											On February 7, 2011, Xun Energy established two subsidiaries in the State of Kentucky. We hired Mr. M. Grubb to be its Operations Manager in Kentucky. The business model was to acquire oil and gas leases with a proven history of oil production and work the abandoned oil and gas wells. The Company focused its efforts on re-entering existing oil and gas wells that previously produced oil and gas, or were producing oil and gas at a fractional output compared to early drilling activity. The Company would undertake workover activities that included one or more of varieties of remedial operations on producing wells, or inactive wells, to try to increase production.
				
											On February 28, 2011, Xun Energy closed on the acquisition of three oil and gas leases in Kentucky.
				
											On March 3, 2011, Xun Energy completed its first workover well, XUN001.
				
											On March 4, 2011, Xun Energy produced 10 barrels of Kentucky sweet crude oil from its first workover oil well, XUN001. This was an important milestone for the Company as we sold the oil which generated the first revenue for the Company in its history of operations. Unfortunately, the well bore was badly damaged from a previous workover and ceased producing after several days of production. The Company abandoned the oil well as the cost of repairing the damage was greater than drilling a new offset well.
				
											On April 18, 2011, the Company filed a Form 8k ("Super 8k") with the SEC disclosing that the Company is no longer a shell and produced oil that was sold and generated its first revenue for the Company.
				
											On May 10, 2011, the Company accepted an Offer to Purchase from Lea Kennedy d/b/a LuxemBarings (“Purchaser”) to purchase $10 million of the Company’s common stock based on the average of 5 consecutive trading day’s close prior to date of closing. The Offer to Purchase was scheduled to close on or before June 24, 2011. The Purchaser failed to complete the transaction, after mutually agreed extensions of the closing date. The failure of the Purchaser to complete the transaction caused damage to the Company. The Company ran out of cash and could not operate or maintain its oil and gas leases in Kentucky. As a result, the Company forfeited its oil and gas leases while attempting to raise capital to continue operations in Kentucky. The Company has retained legal counsel to take legal action against the Purchaser for failing to complete the purchase transaction and for damages to the Company as a result of the failure to complete the transaction.
				


2011 - 2012
											With the loss of properties in Kentucky, and after having consulted with current and potential investors, Xun Energy shifted its business model and began to research other venues for oil and gas properties; venues that historically produce high outputs of oil and gas such as in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Kansas and Canada.  Although potential investors were prepared to invest more funds than what needed to do Kentucky workover and exploration, Xun Energy began negotiations for higher quality leases. It also diversified its affiliations with new investor sources with interest in oil and gas production. 
				

											In November, 2011, Xun Energy began action to acquire the West Crockett Prospect in West Texas. The project consisted of six (6) sparsely drilled and yet to be fully developed leases totaling 2,320 acres of leasehold on which the first well was drilled in 1941; the field still produces today. The Company's plan was to acquire the leases and begin an aggressive development program of drilling and completing 90 oil wells increasing production from the current 1,900 to 2,500 barrels oil per month (BOPM) to oil production output of 27,000 barrels of oil per month within 36 months of closing. 
				

											On February 14, 2012, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement which when closed would transfer the West Crockett prospect to Xun Energy. Closing was scheduled for April 30, 2012 and amended to close on or before May 31, 2012. Xun Energy could not arrange enough financing for the $17 million acquisition on the tight schedule required and this resulted in Xun Energy losing its earnest deposit. 
				



											Currently Xun Energy is extracting oil from its working Pennsylvania Rice property and actively negotiating to acquire additional properties in Texas in 2015. Concurrently, Company executives are devoting significant time and expertise to developing Xun Oil Marketing (XOM) as a profitable division, and earn an international reputation as a reliable buyer and seller of petroleum products. XUN intends to grow significantly in 2015, management plans to add the most experienced personnel who can move a company on an upward trajectory. This will include an augmented internal operations and financial staff as well as field operatives to oversee oil and gas property development.

Date:  November 16, 2016 XUN ENERGY, INC. /s/ Jerry G. Mikolajczyk   By: Jerry G. Mikolajczyk Title: President and CEO  Source: http://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=11694637    ********************LATEST PRESS RELEASES:********************   IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 2 YEARS SINCE THIS PRESS RELEASE CAME OUT. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEALS OR SHARE HOLDER VALUE. BUYER BEWARE.   ********************************  ♦  Dec 24, 2014 Xun Energy Actuates Physical Commodity Trades Division  PRESS RELEASE    PORTLAND, OR--(Marketwired - December 24, 2014) - Xun Energy, Inc., (OTC PINK: XNRG) (the "Company") is pleased to announce that the Board of Directors approved the actuation of the physical commodity trades division, Xun Oil Marketing (XOM), on December 24, 2014. The Company has been researching and testing the concept over the last several months and believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to engage the physical commodity trades market with its own proprietary and creative business model. With the Board's approval Xun Oil Marketing begins its assignment to execute the objectives of its business model. The new division's business model is that of a Buyer and Seller of a wide range of petroleum products sourced internationally and sold to Exit Buyers. It is the task of this new division to undertake the purchase of refined petroleum products at the lowest possible price and sell at the highest; to establish long term contracts with international suppliers and creditable Buyers, primarily "Majors" (major airlines, Fedex, UPS, DHL, etc.); and to earn an exemplary reputation for industry standard delivery performance, service and flexibility. XOM will collaborate with qualified financiers to fund our refined product purchases, assemble joint ventures and partnerships with individuals and companies that can facilitate these transactions. Jerry G. Mikolajczyk, President and CEO of Xun Energy, will head the management team of XOM and says of the XOM launch, "Xun Energy has the management capabilities to guide the new division through the successful purchasing, marketing and logistics of refined petroleum products. Over several years, I have made connections and facilitated refined product sales by others. I feel it is time for the Company to capitalize on the work and expertise I've gained." He further states: "Our focus will be primarily on Aviation Jet Fuel (AJF) physical commodity trades as the demand for AJF is greater than the supply and each transaction involves large quantities. A small margin multiplied by large quantities can generate substantial cash flow for the Company in a relatively short timeframe between the time of purchase of the AJF and the sale of the AJF, a matter of hours, not days or months." As part of its activation process, the Company will launch a dedicated website for XOM. The dedicated website, www.xunoil.com, outlines the business model and will provide performance data as physical commodity trades are completed by the Company. "We are excited to announce our new division and the XOM web site! Here Buyers and Sellers of refined petroleum products, as well as financiers, can view information on the full range of Xun Oil Marketing objectives and its performance," says Mr. Mikolajczyk.

XUN Oil Marketing - Home -  A Division of XUN Energy


























Connect with us











MISSION OF XUN OIL MARKETING (XOM)


It is XOM's mission to establish long-term purchase contracts with suppliers of petroleum products and to sell such products to MAJORS. As part of this mission we intend to become an industry leader by exhibiting exemplary business practices, by employing wise and ethical decision making, maximizing return for our financing partners and shareholders, and pursuing opportunities internationally with knowledgeable partners who will augment our capabilities and provide revenue enhancement channels.









OUR HISTORY
In the Fall, 2013, ready and willing buyers of petroleum products asked XUN Energy, Inc. President, Jerry G. Mikolajczyk, to assist them in sourcing and procuring refined products for new markets. In the past, Mr. Mikolajczyk had facilitated petroleum and physical commodity transactions for buyers on a pro bono basis. In order to capitalize on his expertise, experience and his industry connections, Mr. Mikolajczyk established the XUN Oil Marketing Division to research and evaluate the buying and selling of petroleum products as a profit centre. The research and evaluation was based on the following business objectives:

Purchase high quality petroleum products from reputable Suppliers;
Establish long term Supplier contracts;
Sell high quality petroleum products to Majors;
Establish long term sales agreements with the Majors; and
Establish long term relationships and creditability with Suppliers and Buyers based on product quality, delivery performance, service and flexibility.

On December 24th, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company passed a board resolution approving the actuation of the XUN OIL MARKETING DIVISION (XOM) as a profit centre for XUN Energy, Inc.




XOM BUSINESS MODEL
Our business model is very simple: "We buy at the lowest price possible and sell at the highest price possible."
To achieve this model, we work with refineries or refinery trade desks to acquire the product and the sell to MAJORS following their procedures, such as CI, DIP and PAY.
We do not buy from Tier 2, Tier 3 or Tier 4 resellers unless the price point between the purchase price and our selling price allows us and the Financier to meet our target profit margins.
With only one exception, we do not sell to resellers. This one exception is if the reseller funds the purchase allowing the reseller to purchase the products from XOM at a discounted price equal to the profits they would realize by selling the product to MAJORS.
XOM works with accredited private individuals, funds and banks that provide XOM with the funding and lines of credit necessary to permit acquisition of product from refineries or trade desks, complying with their procedures. This allows XOM to purchase the products at the lowest possible prices while allowing us to be the titleholder of the product which we then sell to MAJORS at the highest prevailing market price. Each Sales Purchase Agreement (SPA) funding is unique and the profits shared are negotiated with the financier and varies from SPA to SPA.
All funding, purchases and sales are confidential. All financiers, suppliers and buyers names are kept confidential. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of XUN ENERGY, INC. and we adhere to Rule 406 under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") and Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), link: SEC Staff Legal Bulletin No 1.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
