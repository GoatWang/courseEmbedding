            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the STMicroelectronics Q1 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call and Live Webcast. I am Moira, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Tait Sorensen, Group Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Good morning. Thank you, everyone for joining our first quarter of 2017 financial results conference call. Hosting the call today is Carlo Bozotti, ST's President and Chief Executive Officer. Joining Carlo on the call today are Jean-Marc Chery, Chief Operating Officer; Carlo Ferro, Chief Financial Officer; and Georges Penalver, Chief Strategy Officer. This live webcast can be accessed through ST's website. A replay will be available shortly after the conclusion of this call.
This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause ST's results to differ materially from management's expectations and plans. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the press release that was issued with the results this morning, and also in ST's most recent regulatory filings for a full description of these risk factors. Also to ensure all participants have an opportunity to ask questions during the Q&A session, please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow up.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Carlo Bozotti, ST's President and CEO. Carlo?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Tait, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings conference call. Our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results and our outlook for the second quarter. But before starting this detailed review of the quarter you might have seen that this morning we also released the main resolutions proposed to our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Among the resolutions, I have accepted to the proposal to extend my role as President and the CEO for one more year, and I am fully committed to drive this company forward. And of course this is with the support of the newly appointed Deputy CEO, Jean-Marc Chery and the strong executive team.
Our objective for 2017 is to achieve a sustainable revenue growth and margin expansion through our strategic focus on Internet of Things and the Smart Driving. The first quarter represented a very good start towards achieving this objective. Revenues increased 12.9% year-over-year to $1.82 billion. We saw healthy growth across all our regions, product groups and sales channels. On a sequential basis, revenues decreased 2.1%, which was 30 basis points better than the mean point of our guidance. Gross margin increased 420 basis points year-over-year to 36.6%. We benefited from a strong improvement in manufacturing efficiencies, a better product mix, lower unused capacity charges, and favorable currency effects, partially offset by the normal pricing adjustment at the start of the year.

On a sequential basis, gross margin came in at 60 basis points, better than the midpoint of our range on better than expected product mix. Operating income before impairment and restructuring grew by $139 million year-over-year to $134 million in the first quarter driven by higher revenues, improved product mix, manufacturing efficiencies, better fab loading and the set-top box restructuring program. In turn, operating margin before impairment and restructuring reached 7.5% of net revenues. Net income also saw a very strong year-over-year swing of $149 million to $108 million. Free cash flow of $62 million doubled already year ago quarter even with the higher capital investments we are making this year to support our growth plans. We ended the quarter with a net financial position of $518 million, stable compared to the Q4 2016, and up by $79 million from the year ago quarter, another indicator of our progress.
Now, let's move to a detailed review of our product groups, beginning with Automotive and Discrete. ADG revenues increased year-over-year by 5.6%, reflecting growth in automotive and strong growth in power discrete products. On a sequential basis, ADG revenues posted a better than seasonal results with a decrease of 1.2%. ADG's operating margin was 5.4% in Q1, substantially stable in comparison to the year ago period. Moving to customer activity, bookings in automotive were robust in the first quarter. Thanks to our focus on technologies and products, enabling greener driving, we had important design wins related to car electrification, particularly in the area of battery management and on-board charging.
A number of OEMs worldwide selected products such as our MOSFET, both high and low voltage silicon, as well as silicon carbide, our 32-bit microcontrollers and the lithium-cell balancing device. We also captured the Body Control Unit for a module from an American Tier-1, and the Power Control Unit for a door zone application at a major European Tier-1. We also had a number of important wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience. We started production of a 32-bit microcontroller for embedded security in a next generation automotive gateway. We won an award for a seat belt pre-tensioner application with our 32-bit microcontroller for a major Tier 1 European customer. And we had multiple wins with a parking brake application specific product.
In our infotainment portfolio, we were awarded new business to our processors, AM/FM tuners, and the Class AB amplifiers from Japanese Tier-1 for the Asian market. In addition, we had design wins and multiple global Tier-1 for rectifiers, protection devices and automotive-grade IPAD devices for powertrain, on-board charger, ADAS and Safety, and high-speed data line networks. Successes in our power discrete business includes a number of wins in Asia for both high and low voltage power supply applications, and a continued expansion of our business on RF integrated passive devices for the IoT market with several large customers.
Moving to our Analog and MEMS Group, AMG, revenues increased 19.9% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in MEMS, continuing the significant progression begun in the second half of 2016. We also enjoyed solid growth in analog products following second half 2016 rebound. On a sequential basis, AMG revenues increased 1.6% better than seasonal with both product areas growing. The strong improvement in AMG product portfolio and competitive position have translated into a significant turnaround in its operating performance over the last two quarters with operating margins of 9.4% in Q4 2016, and 10.1% in Q1 this year, compared to substantially breakeven results one year ago.
Our ability to design in multiple products into flagship smartphone and IoT devices was evident during the first quarter. First, we ramped production of several products inside the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, including 6-axis ultra-low-power MEMS inertial measurements unit and optical-image stabilization gyroscope, a barometric sensor, a touch controller, and the multifunction protection switch. And in the new and very popular Nintendo gaming system, the Switch, we have motion sensors and the touch controller, as well as multiple STM32 microcontrollers, and Near Field Communication controller from our Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group.

As well, we continue to gain share with motion and the environmental sensors in smartphones and wearables worldwide, but also in communication systems. Automotive is an important focus area for our sensor business. Moving to IoT, we continued the strong design-in momentum in low-power wireless connectivity with our Bluetooth low energy solutions, as well as the SPIRIT sub-1GHz family for home and building automation. During the quarter, we also launched a partnership with USound to produce the world's first piezo-MEMS speaker with excellent sound quality, targeting IoT applications.
In smart industry, we broadened our customer base for our STSPIN32 motion control family, including multiple designs for our newly introduced intelligent motor control devices. We also started production for a 6-axis inertial sensor for high-end industrial applications. In addition, we won multiple designs for a range of analog products for the next-generation smart metering solutions. Our broad analog portfolio strongly complements our other product families, allowing us to design-in more silicon content across our customer base.
Now, let me share some highlights on our Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group. MDG saw a strong progression, with revenues increasing year-over-year by 11.4%, or 14.6% if we exclude discontinued businesses. Key drivers were strong growth in general purpose microcontrollers and growth in digital products. MDG's operating income and margin also had very positive swing, with its operating income up $64 million year-over-year, and its operating margin of 10.2% in the first quarter. With our general purpose microcontrollers, we again set a new quarterly revenue record. With a goal to continue the momentum going forward, we introduced new products for our existing STM32 families, including new STM32L4 MCUs, adding larger memories, enhanced graphics support, and increased power-saving flexibility.
We continued to expand the STM32 ecosystem with tools from STM partners. For example, we teamed with DSP Concepts to offer STM32 users free access to an advanced audio design tool. We also introduced the MCU Finder for PC desktops, a new STM32F7 Nucleo board and Discovery kit, a new STM32 board to evaluate low-power, long-range IoT connectivity. Getting our development tools into the hands of embedded developers is a key step in the design-in process. And, with over 1 million STM32 development kits now shipped to the market, we are on the right track to expand our base of over 40,000 customers.
Moving to security; we announced the availability of the new advanced Near Field Communication ST20NFCD (sic) [ST21NFCD] (14:50) controller, integrating the recently acquired booster technology. This product was already awarded a design win with a major OEM. We also launched a new STSAFE solution to secure devices connected to the Sigfox low-power wide-area network. And we teamed with Giesecke and FitPay Mobile-Payment to offer a solution to integrate tokenized payments from Mastercard or Visa on wearable devices. Benefiting from our recent acquisition, we captured a key win for our ST25 Near Field Communication reader portfolio at a major car OEM. We also introduced dynamic-tag ICs that support higher speed and greater distance RFID.
Also in this area, we are focused on making our products easier for our customers to evaluate and design-in, and we introduced a new ST25 Discovery kit that accelerates time-to-market for NFC applications.
To complete the review of our products, let's now discuss our Imaging Product Division, which we report in Others. Imaging revenues in the first quarter more than doubled, to $72 million, compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by ST's innovative Time-of-Flight technology. We had multiple new design wins and continued high-volume shipment of Time-of-Flight ranging sensors to leading smartphone manufacturers. During Q1, our FlightSense technology was integrated in seven new smartphones launched by Asian brands. We also announced a new generation of Time-of-Flight sensor which brings multi-object detection and multi-array scanning to mobile applications.

Turning now to our second quarter guidance, we expect to make further progress in revenue and margins. We continue to see strong bookings across all product groups and regions. A careful analysis of point-of-sales data, or sales through distribution, continues to indicate a very healthy demand environment. Therefore, based upon our current visibility, we expect the sequential revenue growth of about 5%, which translates to year-over-year growth of 12.3% at the midpoint. We are targeting a gross margin of about 38.1% at the midpoint. Taking these two data points, it is clear that we see the opportunity in Q2 to deliver substantial year-over-year and sequential growth in operating income and net income.
Looking further ahead, we are continuing to prepare for a major program introduction. As anticipated, there is no revenue contribution from this program in our Q2 guidance, and we are on track to ramp substantial revenues in the second half of this year. More broadly, our investments to scale up production in 12 inches, our 6-inch to 8-inch fab conversions, and our technology evolution will help drive wafer cost reductions, benefiting all product groups. Finally, today ST's Supervisory board is proposing to shareholders to declare a cash dividend of $0.24 per share payable in four equal quarterly installments starting with the second quarter of 2017. The 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for June 20, 2017.
And my colleagues and I will now be happy to take your questions. And we look forward to meeting with you on May 11 at our 2017 Capital Markets Day in London. Thank you.

The first question is from Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a clarification on the MEMS business. I think you talked about the several chips being used in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ devices. I think in some of those sockets, in the past you've shared that chip with some other supplier because that device has had two variants, one with Qualcomm chip and one with Exynos chip. Can you give us some color as to whether that is still continuing with S8 and S8+, or are you becoming more of a sole supplier in some of those sockets in this generation?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, of course, it's difficult for me to comment on such detailed question. But the impression that we have is that certainly our share is lion's share.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. But if the share is not changing, it's lion's share, but it's not changing from last year. Is that the right way to think about it?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, you can see, if the share is 100%, it's difficult in general to change.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. Thank you. And one question on the automotive side of things. I think you've talked about bookings being strong in Q1. I think we're starting to see some data points that China obviously was very, very strong last year, and the year-on-year comps are a bit difficult as we go into Q2, Q3 of this year. Are we seeing any signs of that as yet in the bookings number, or you think that the content increase is enough or is accelerating, which will offset any slowdown in volume growth? Is that the case, or are you not seeing any volume slow down as yet?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
No. It's the opposite. We see an acceleration of our business in the automotive. Q1, it is certainly a low point for automotive, and we expect to grow significantly. Overall, I also want to make the point that we have, on top of ADG, other products that we sell to automotive customers, of course, including our sensors, and including our digital products (22:55). So they are important products that we sell to our automotive customers that we do not report in ADG. And overall, I want to make sure it's clear, our ambition is to grow significantly this year in the automotive business. And certainly, we do not see any slowdown and we see an acceleration of our automotive business moving from Q1 to Q2 and the rest of the year.

Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Carlo.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Please go ahead.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Ltd.
Thanks. Just a couple if I could. The CapEx run rate looks like it's tracking slightly below your full year guidance. So just wondered whether you're finding more efficiencies in CapEx than you thought, or whether we should expect a pick up through the rest of the year, and then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Carlo will take this.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Carlo. Good morning, everyone. Now, I will not read the first quarter number as a sign on the run rate (24:08) for the year. We are absolutely on track on the plan of $1.1 billion CapEx spending for the year. We are in the process now to look at the volume and the capacity needed for second half of the year entering 2018. So in this respect, at this stage, I believe you may continue to make reference to the previous guidance. We will meet in a few weeks at our Capital Market Day. That could be an opportunity eventually to tune the numbers, but please do not consider the number of the first quarter as a sign not to be at the high of the range for this year. And capacity (24:49) is what needed in order to serve business and increase the revenues significant for the second half of the year.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Ltd.
That's great. Thank you very much. And just as a follow up, can I just have a follow up take on the under saturation charges, presumably zero in the last quarter and zero going forward from here from that statement?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Very minor, in both cases we are running with the fab almost all at full loading. We are in the process of increasing capacities, improving the service to customer, and building higher revenues for the next quarters.
Gareth Jenkins - UBS Ltd.
Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
You're welcome.

The next question is from Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for letting me on. My question is regarding the next-generation technologies in 3D sensing. You have some technologies associated with 3D sensing. Can you, Carlo, possibly help us understand what technology you have associated with this? And is it purely sensing technologies, or are you also selling digital chips associated with this? Secondly, my question is regarding the CapEx you announced earlier this year. What percentage of the CapEx are you spending on front-end versus back-end? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Our activity in this field is very broad, and I think, Jean-Marc will comment here. And then, Carlo will take the second question.
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
So Jean-Marc speaking. So more basically to make history as simple as possible for 3D sensing, we see really two technologies which are key enablers, is what we call structured light; and the second one, we call Time-of-Flight technology, and in Time-of-Flight, it was direct or indirect Time-of-Flight. What I can say at this stage is that, ST from silicon point of view, we own, we develop, we control, we are able to make the manufacturing of all technologies which are key, whatever is the Time-of-Flight or the structured light. Then, in term of module assembly of the key module linked to this technology, we completely control the technology in term of module assemblies. We have the skill to manage all the critical components which are related to the structured light, and we are able to make the manufacturing of the module. So ST is completely well positioned with his specialty imaging strategy to address this market of 3D sensing, whatever are the technology, Time-of-Flight or structured light.

Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Sorry. I have one follow up on that, Jean-Marc, which is, does your technology require a separate digital chip beyond the sensing module that you will sell?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
Of course. Okay. You need to have a digital chip to embed the software because structured light is very complex request in term of software. So you have the separate chips, digital chips to receive the signal from the various component and create the 3D image.
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
And do you supply that digital chip as well?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
No.
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Okay. Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Sandeep. Next question?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
I guess, Sandeep has a second question on the capital spend in this year between front-end and back-end. When taking front-end manufacturing and R&D this is about 55%. Probing, assembling and testing will be about 45%.
Sandeep Sudhir Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc

The next question is from Adithya Metuku from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning, guys. So my question is firstly a clarification. Could you give us some highlight on the growth rates in the automotive, microcontroller and Analog and MEMS businesses in the past quarter? And then I have a quick follow up on OpEx.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
So the first question is about the growth rate on automotive.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Automotive, microcontroller and Analog and MEMS.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Right. So I think we can go through Carlo, we'll go through family-by-family if you – we have all the data, of course.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Your question is in reference to which period, the first quarter?
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. First quarter.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. It's in the press release, right?
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
No. I don't mean the groups. I mean automotive within the division that you disclosed.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. So I believe that the answer, the best way for characterizing it is that in the area of ADG, both automotive and the power and discrete enjoyed better than seasonal trend overall. Then in the case of AMG, it has been another strong quarter for MEMS, but also a stronger quarter for analog. And certainly in the field of MDG, you may have noted there is some further erosion in the area of the digital business and the legacy business there, while general purpose microcontrollers remain particularly solid.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. My quick follow up is on OpEx, Carlo Ferro. Could you give us a bit of color taking into the current spot rates what you expect in terms of growth in net OpEx in the next quarter and then the second half of the year? Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. We remain on our target to maintain, in average, the net OpEx in the range of $550 million. We have anticipated that there is some unbalance quarterly due to seasonality, particularly third quarter is cheaper in seasonality, if I can use the word. Second quarter and fourth quarter a bit higher. So I would basically (31:45) between $550 million to $560 million net operating expenses in the second quarter.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

Next question is from Jerome Ramel from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Jerome Ramel - Exane, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. A question on automotive in Q1, I mean, Automotive and Discrete you were up 5.6% year-on-year, and you mentioned that discrete grew faster. So my question is, why the automotive growing not in line with peer, because peer is quite distant to peer in Q1 (32:24) year-on-year, much more than 5.5%. So do you think you're losing market share, or do you see you're going to have an acceleration in, as you mentioned before, in the second half of this year? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, I think, first of all we need to look at the perimeter. As I said, I mean, there will be a strong acceleration of the growth, and this will be across the board for all automotive products. It will be on what we traditionally called APG, which is smart power and microcontrollers and digital automotive. It will be on Power MOS, it will be on SiC, and it will be also on our MEMS, for instance, for automotive applications. And the visibility that we have today for the automotive growth year-over-year is far above the 5.6% that you mentioned.
Jerome Ramel - Exane, Inc.
Okay. And maybe a follow up. I had in mind that your MEMS business for automotive was about $150 (33:42) million per quarter. Is that the right number?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, this is a very detailed question. We are growing significantly. I think it still is below $100 million.
Jerome Ramel - Exane, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Janardan Menon from Liberum Capital. Please go ahead.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just going back to a comment that you made that your CapEx in the second half will also depend on what the volume expectations are, et cetera, and you talked about the significant ramp in the second half of revenue. I was just wondering, what is the visibility that you have on that? I mean, is it that you are yet to get your purchase orders and your purchase orders will come later on, and that will give you a better feel for what that revenue ramp will look like, or do you already have a pretty good feel for how that will look like, in terms of volume and ASP? And if there is any sort of movement in that number, is that mainly from a back-end CapEx point of view, or would you consider adding front-end CapEx as well in the second half, if the volume required for that?
And second question is, at your Mobile World Congress presentation, I think there was a comment saying that you had a $1 billion run rate on IoT microcontrollers. I was just wondering, can you put together a number for what is your IoT revenue at this point in time, if you go through all the different divisions, and what would you say the ballpark figure of growth for that business right now?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Maybe Janardan, I take your question quite quickly, to refer like (35:31) Carlo said during the introduction, that the demand environment is very solid, and we enter really the next quarter with a very solid backlog. On the rest of your question, you really want, Janardan, to spoil our Capital Market Day? Let's have a little bit of content to come on May 10 on the second half of the year.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Okay. Can I get one more...
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
(35:56) maybe one comment. The visibility is pretty good. And I think, in this moment, we discussed automotive. I think the visibility that we have, in general, with our automotive customers is to grow much faster than the 5.6%. The POS and distribution is at a record level, and inventories are low. And we are perfectly on track with our new major programs. So the three things are working well. So I think we have good confidence to make a substantial step in revenues, moving from Q2 to the second half of the year.

Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Understood. Thank you

The next question is from Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. Not to belabor the point too much on the second half visibility. But you mentioned the sort of key product ramp for the back half of the year, I think sort of on the sensing side of things. You've also highlighted in the past silicon carbide ramp. Just, how's your visibility there, in terms of so the key customer starting in the back half of the year? And also, can you perhaps shed a little bit more light about engagement elsewhere? I think you said you had a win in Asia for silicon carbide. Just how you expect trends to progress there for 2018 and 2019, based on customer engagement?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
We are, first of all, in the condition to confirm the ramp, which is not a major program that we have described. And this program is also, as we already said, is also calling for important capital investment. The silicon carbide is an important contributor in the second half. Is starting, I think is pretty nowadays (38:16) because it is high volume, and we are very proud about this growth on silicon carbide. And we see an acceleration of design wins on silicon carbide products. In the press release, we mentioned this design award in Asia, but there are many things moving on also in Europe. This is, I believe, important to underline. So it is a new generation of products, and of course, there will be a contribution in the second part of this year. But we are confident that this contribution will grow materially the next few years.

The next question is from Mathias Santos Silva from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Mathias Santos Silva - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hello. Thank you for taking my question. First, regarding to the CapEx ramp, is this entirely related to models to be launched this year, or is there also some in there regarding models to be launched next year? And also, in the application that's going out in the market in the second half that will drive that revenue ramp, do you forecast that kind of application going into broad-based smartphone manufacturers as well, or is it mostly related to that one customer perhaps? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, CapEx (39:39).
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. On CapEx, as you could expect at the end, intense capital spending is, at the end, addressing all the, I'll say, three relevant objective for us, which is to start the new program in the second half of the year, is to build capacity for expanding revenues in the second half of the year, and preparing a capacity for 2018. And this is almost across all the different process technologies for the company, and to serve a growth for all the three product groups in the Imaging division, or the subset of our business.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. To respond to the second question, when we talk about this major project, of course, it's not one single device. This is obvious. And some of the products are certainly suitable for many, many customers, while some other products are more dedicated to one customer.
Mathias Santos Silva - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc

The next question is from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Yeah. Good morning. A question for Jean-Marc. You mentioned you had a capability in structured light. I was just wondering what capability you have today in wafer level optics, or are you partnering with firms like CDA (41:32) or Hynix? And then the second question would just be on the Time-of-Flight. You've launched a multi-object, multi-array scanner. I was just wondering what kind of level of increase of content that could generate versus your simple SPAD-based proximity sensor today. Just a sort of multiple would be interesting. Thanks.
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
Now, what is important when you would like to control this kind of technology is to have the skill, the technical skill in the critical component. Of course, in structured light one of the critical components is disfactored (42:12) optical elements, and you mentioned Hynix. Of course, Hynix (42:18) is one of the key supplier in the world. What is important for us is to have the technical skill to understand what are the best components and the best offer in the world. It is an example. Then, you have the voxel. Voxel, there is many voxel (42:37), many power, different power for Time-of-Flight, for structured light. For us, it's important to have the skill to be able to know very well the process, to assess the capability of the values (42:55) and to challenge it. (42:59) there is also a component like that, like the filters, lens and so on and so forth.
So ST, we have built in our Imaging division, very strong capability to understand this key components from the bill of material to challenge (43:16). And then, one of the key capability we have is engineering and manufacturing capability to assemble and test all these components in a module. By the way, this is what we have demonstrated last year, with one component for (43:37) customer we have delivered in the course of 2016. So really, we have a good control of the supply chain, and we have a good control of the manufacturing of this kind of module. But then from silicon point of view, means the sensors of the Time-of-Flight all-in-one technology that year we have, this is our core competence in term of silicon footprint, and we know the technology. We are very good on that, very aggressive on that, and we position ourself for future generation.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Great. That's helpful. And just on the Time-of-Flight, I think the current proximity sensors is only a $1 component, the one you shipped into the iPhone. But I would assume, with an array, these multi-point Time-of-Flight sensors are significantly higher. Do you have a sort of rough estimate of how much more content this could generate?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, we cannot comment on the price. Of course, price and complexity are related, and also I do not want to comment on the price of the existing solution. You mentioned it, so certainly not possible for us to comment on the price. But clearly with more content, more complexity, the evolution of the price is in the right direction.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG

The next question is from Stéphane Houri from Natixis. Please go ahead.
Stéphane Houri - Natixis SA
Yes. Hello. Good morning.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Good morning.
Stéphane Houri - Natixis SA
I have a question on gross margin because you commented that the unused (45:25) charge is very limited. So what are the ways to improve the gross margin going further, and what's the potential? Thank you.

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, Carlo will comment. I will say, the potential is significant.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Again, you note, Stéphane, that already in the guidance for the next quarter we are anticipating at midpoint of the guidance another step of progression. I believe really what is nicely coming in as a factor there is that the innovation is making product mix able to somehow compensate the natural, or be till the future of (46:13) the natural price erosion in the industry, and the gross margin can take advantage of higher efficiencies. And efficiencies, of course, is a function on the volume of the fab, not only in respect to the absorption of the unused capacity charges that now is fully done, but also in respect of the big opportunity of scaling up capacity in the fab going forward. When we have entered the year, we have anticipated for the second half of the year a very significant contribution to the wafer cost, particularly in 300-millimeter from scaling up fabs also associated with the new program, and this has really to come for the second half of the year.
Stéphane Houri - Natixis SA
Okay. Thank you. And just a follow up, if I may. Looking at your Q2 guidance of 5% growth, could you give us some indication about what's going to happen into the different division which is going to fastest growing and the one who will grow less?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Carlo?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
As usual, without characterizing specifically growth by sub-groups, I may indicate to you whether we expect more solid growth sequentially for the next quarter, and this is certainly about the automotive and the micromemories, and secure microcontrollers, is in its second level for power discrete and analog. And in the case of digital, will be a further slight erosion associated with the phase out of legacy.

The next question is from Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. Amit Harchandani from Citigroup, and thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. My first question would be around trends in the distribution business and also inventory levels across the supply chain. Could you maybe share your thoughts in terms of the segments? How you've seen the trends in distribution evolve as you've gone through the quarter? And maybe some initial thoughts on the month of April. And then I have a second question after that. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
The visibility, well, first of all, we know, while Q1, and I can say that it was unprecedently strong POS with a very healthy situation, and this is across the board. I have to say that Asia is strong, but Europe that is important for us in distribution of growth, is also very, very strong, even stronger than Asia. And we do not see any change in April. We see a very good trend in the month of April, both in terms of bookings and in terms of POS. I would like to underline again that the situation of inventory is pretty healthy. And of course, what we are trying to do here, for instance, yesterday and the day before yesterday, we had a major event in China on our STM32.
We had 2,000 participants to this event, and this is mostly developers, people working with our microcontrollers and building around our microcontrollers with other products. And this is exactly what we want to do, we want to sell more around our STM32. So we are encouraged by this trend. So we see a good momentum. It was strong in Q1. I think somebody mentioned before that our general-purpose microcontroller, it was $1 billion business or so before. I think, today the run rate is more, $300 million per quarter and growing. And this is, I believe, it is a fundamental family for our mass market strategy and for our distribution business. We want to sell more of the rest of our kits together with our STM32. So pretty good visibility in distribution.

Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you for the detailed comments, Carlo. And maybe as a second question, I was looking at the press release this morning with respect to the proposal for the new executive team, and the creation of the position of Deputy CEO. Just wanted to understand your thoughts behind coming up with this new executive team structure. Is it in response to what you see out there in the industry? And also, should we maybe look at the creation of a Deputy CEO position as a step in the succession planning, thinking one year from now, or am I getting a ahead of myself? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Well, I think, first of all, I believe this is a unique opportunity for Jean-Marc. We've been working with Jean-Marc, it's now many, many years, in fact, since the moment of creation of the company in 1987. So it's certainly an important step for Jean-Marc. I mean, Jean-Marc in his career managed manufacturing, technology, certain products, and this is a unique opportunity to expand. We mentioned in our press release that there will be a more stronger involvement of Jean-Marc in sales and marketing. So I think he's well deserved. Times are (52:59) getting better, and Jean-Marc gave an important contribution, very important contribution in the turnaround in this area. Having said that, it's certainly not up to me to comment on the succession. This is not a matter that is discussed at the level of management, but is of course, is our Supervisory Board.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
And just the rest of the executive team structure, the changes there, I just wanted to understand the thought process behind that, (53:30).
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, there are basically two changes; one change is the unification (53:40) of the regions. I think (53:45), of course, all the organizations can work very nicely or maybe a little bit less. But I think we believe this is the right moment to make the steps. Some of our customers are, of course, very, very global, and this including some of our distributors, our presence with distributors is becoming more and more important. And of course, we also want to make sure that there is a very good global approach in what we do with our global distributors. And the other one is somehow related to the promotion of Jean-Marc, and the promotion of Orio Bellezza that is taking also the digital technologies on top of what he already has in terms of power and analog technologies. The rest is basically continuation, and I think he is actual evolution (55:01). I think, of course, the role of Jean-Marc is unique for all. And I am sure that we will continue with the turnaround. We are better, but certainly not at the level we want to be. And there is the opportunity to make another important steps in the second half of this year. And well, if you do first of all, then in the second half of this year, and of course, also in 2018.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you very much, Carlo.

The next question is from Lee Simpson from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Great. Thanks for letting me on there. Maybe if I just circle back to OpEx, if I could, and SG&A, in particular. SG&A looked pretty steady last year, but going into Q1, things have picked up perhaps a little higher than just my modeling. But just trying to get a sense for how that pans out to the year. And I'm looking in particular for comments as they relates to restructuring. I mean, obviously restructuring has been heavy for last two years. I just wonder, if the restructuring charges having now peaked means the SG&A, the downside, or the ability to push SG&A down has maxed out already. Thanks.

Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
I believe the short answer to your question is, the status of progression in the set-top box restructuring (56:39) now at the stage that most of savings are already in, about 74% of the targeted savings are already in the result of the first quarter. And certainly, the portion still to go is the one that could help going forward to reabsorb the normal inflation dynamic in expenses, some strengthening of our firepower (57:09) in sales and marketing. So at the end, as anticipated when we talked in January, we see the combination of the completion of the restructuring plan and other ingredients to be substantially offering the company the possibility to keep expenses in this range of the $550 million net per quarter on one side, and on the other side doing so, taking a full advantage to the operating margin from the top line growth.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Great. I guess, in summary, we can expect some further savings in R&D as a result.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Again, what we could expect going forward in the next quarter is expenses, and (57:57), operating expenses to be substantially flattish. This is also what we are anticipating with the visibility of the second quarter. That will be a few million higher than the first quarter and the third quarter. That will be some millions lower than the second quarter and the first quarter.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Got you. That's very clear. And maybe just circling back to the earlier question, I think this one goes to Jean-Marc, you were very good at giving us detail around the expansion to an array solution in Time-of-Flight. But you step back from giving the ASP increase. In the absence of giving us an ASP increase, could you give us perhaps the silicon area increase?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
This is even worse.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Well, I guess, if we can get a ratio on the array itself. I mean, are going from a 0.4 by 0.4 (58:53) to a 1 millimeter squared solution? Is that the way to look at this?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
No, we cannot comment. Also of course, it's never that clear whether we are talking about exactly the same thing. It is about the evolution of the Time-of-Flight, or is a more complex chipset. I already mentioned that we are not talking about one product here, and I think it's very, very complex. What I can say is that this is a unique capability that we are (59:36) and, of course, we want to (59:38) on this capability. And it is coming from all of these specialty technologies that we have developed in imaging, and we want to have a very, very important return. And now, we are in the phase of the ramp up. We are on track, and I'm sure we can give more information, of course, during (1:00:18).
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Great. Thanks anyway. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Veysel Taze from ODDO. Please go ahead.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one question regarding your MEMS business. It was a little bit difficult to read the development in the MEMS business if you look at the inventory – or the news flow from China about inventory correction there, et cetera. But your MEMS business has grown very strong in Q1. I see the point that, Samsung, you had one additional design win versus the prior generation with the touch controller. Was that the main driver, or are there other factors which drove the business here?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
The touch controller is not reported in the MEMS. The touch controller is reported in our Analog. So there is no relation. I mean, of course, it's reported in AMG, but you talk about MEMS. So I wanted to be accurate. Now, what we see, MEMS, it is strong demand, the month of March was pretty strong bookings. I have to say that in February, with the Chinese New Year, it was a correction, but very, very strong March booking on MEMS. Carlo mentioned before that we will grow sequentially on MEMS, moving into Q2, so the growth year-over-year will be substantial growth. And the priorities are always the same. I think we wanted to diversify this business, diversify in terms of technologies, so not only MEMS sensors, but also MEMS micro-actuators.

We want to diversify in terms of customers. So you mentioned Samsung, but we want to be more spread with many customers, including important customers in China. And we, importantly, want to diversify in terms of market segments. And I mentioned before that what we do in MEMS for automotive is not yet the level, I believe, of the potential that we have in this area, and this is certainly an important priority. So I tried to give you the three axes; diversification in terms of technology, diversification in terms of customer base, and diversification in terms of market. The momentum is good, and we see a good trend. The month of March was pretty strong, and the demand is strong.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Sorry. I think I missed – the touch controller is part of which segment?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Analog.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Okay. And second question, regarding the gross margin, and what Carlo Ferro mentioned regarding the scaling up of the volumes and the fabs. If I look your gross margin profile, first half this year versus first half of last year, so it seems like around 400 basis points year-over-year growth. So the question would be, what could be the kind of leverage you're trying to get in the second half of the year as indication? I mean, last year, you had roughly 37% in second half of the year. Is there – what would be like the opportunity there? The 400 basis points, I guess, in first half would be too high.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
You see, for the time being, it's nice to see that now is several quarters in a row that each quarter, gross margin is (1:04:45) 4 points higher than the prior year quarter.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
So, we cannot give the guidance for Q3. I think, as I said, we believe there are significant opportunities. Carlo mentioned already very well, I mean, what is the effect and all, (1:05:10) that is a very important thing to do. Due to the turn of inventory, we'll have a positive effect in Q3, starting from Q3.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
One final one on your auto business, if I may. In the auto business, you mentioned that growth will accelerate for the rest of the year. And if I look at the growth in Q1, it was above 5% year-end. But nevertheless, if I look some of the peers, they are expecting for this year double-digit growth in their auto business. And also Q1 for some of them, look really stronger than your Q1. So any indication how strong this acceleration could be? So could we move into double-digit range or high single-digit?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Well, my comment before was year-over-year. And I was saying that when we compare with others, we need to take in consideration also the organization of the company. And we have products that are important products for automotive that are maybe not in ADG or in APG (1:06:41), particularly. For instance, let's make a couple of examples. The silicon carbide growth is certainly for automotive, and this will be in ADG. It will be in the discrete part of ADG. We expect a strong growth on digital in the automotive. And this will be in what we call ADG (1:07:10), that is still part of ADG. But there are other families, very important families for us in the automotive. As I mentioned before, it's of course, MEMS. There are other companies that are reporting the sensors for automotive together with the business segment. For us, of course, is automotive in terms of customers, and this is going to be reported under MEMS. And so if you put all together year-over-year, we want to be close to double-digit growth. Yes.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Thanks a lot.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

Thank you, Veysel. Based on time, we'll take one more question, Moira.
Operator
The last question is from Gianmarco Bonacina from Equita SIM. Please go ahead.
Gianmarco Bonacina - Equita SIM SpA
Yes. Very good morning. Just a quick one about car electrification. You mentioned new design wins in Q1. I read in the press release, in particular, there is one on SiC MOSFET with Asian OEM. Can you give a little bit more detail? Is this in Japan or in China? And then more broadly, can we say that the bill of material for you is pretty similar, either if it's hybrid or a pure electric, or let's say, on average, there is in lot of (1:08:44) because we are basically trying to track the announcement in terms of new products from the different OEMs. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, first of all, on the customer, every time we can mention the customer, we tend to do. When we cannot, we are not in the position of comment on the customer name, and we do not do. I think what is important for us is the two applications; one of course is the inverter; and then it's the system that is driving the electric model. And our proposition here, of course, is to start replacing IGBT with our SiC Power MOS. And there are many, many Power MOS per inverter. And now, I cannot say the number, but there are many, many Power MOS per inverter, tens of Power MOS per inverter. And this is one opportunity. Every time there is an inverter, so every time there is an electric model in the car, so of course, including hybrid, there is another application where we believe that the SiC is also a very good solution, is the on-board charger. And I think our products are suitable both for the inverter and the on-board charger. For the customer, I've been told the other day, maybe I can say the region, not the customer. Yeah, I can say the region of the customer, so it's China.
Gianmarco Bonacina - Equita SIM SpA
Okay. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Gianmarco.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
At this point, we'll go ahead and wrap up. And as Carlo mentioned earlier on, we will have our Capital Markets Day on May 11 in London. If you need any information on that, please contact Investor Relation. And again, thank you for participating.

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Tait, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter and first half earnings conference call. Our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results by product group, our outlook for the third quarter and our ambitions for the second half overall.
Before beginning, I want to welcome our Deputy CEO, Jean-Marc Chery to his new role, which officially started on July 2nd. I look forward to working even more closely with Jean-Marc and with our strong executive team to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth.
Let's start now with our financial review. As you have seen, we are putting together quarters of successive improvement in our financial results. The second quarter delivered further improvement with strong, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, and with operating income and net income following the same trajectory.
Revenues increased 5.6% sequentially a better than seasonal performance and 60 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 12.9% with growth coming from all product groups and sales channels.
In the Internet of Things and smartphones, we continue to win business with our complete portfolio of microcontrollers, sensors, analog and power management, connectivity and secure solutions. And IoT, our distribution channel plays a key role with point of sales in the second quarter growing 13% year-over-year. Distribution represented 34% of our revenues in Q2.

In Smart Driving, we continue to capture opportunities both with products developed in our Automotive and Discrete Group, as well as with products such as sensors and general purpose analogs which are developed by other groups and fit the need of Automotive customers. With our present visibility, we expect our overall Automotive business to grow by about 10% in 2017.
For the first half of 2017, ST's quarterly revenues were $3.74 billion, up 12.9%. Gross margin was 38.3% in the second quarter, 20 basis points above the midpoint of our range. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased by 70 basis points, positively impacted by favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by price erosion.
On a year-over-year basis, gross margin increased by 440 basis points, reflecting manufacturing efficiencies, improved fab loading and a favorable product mix partially offset by normal price pressure.
Operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased to $184 million, representing an operating margin of 9.6%, thanks to our product and profit initiatives driving operating leverage, better product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased by $50 million and $144 million respectively.
Net income in the second quarter was up sharply to $151 million, representing a sequential improvement of $43 million and, on a year-over-year basis, a swing of $128 million. First half 2017 net income totaled $258 million.
Free cash flow was $52 million in the second quarter and $113 million for the first half. This means that we can support our higher level of capital investment in 2017 from our improved cash flow from operations. Exiting the second quarter, our net financial position was $524 million, slightly up from the first quarter and higher by $98 million compared to one year ago, after having distributed $207 million in dividends.
To strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility, in July we raised $1.5 billion at an overall zero cost, through a convertible bond offering. Additionally, the combination of the net share settlement option and the ongoing repurchase of the underlining shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders. Proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes, including support for growth, and the redemption of our 2019 and 2021 convertible bonds.
Now, let's move to a detailed review of our product groups, beginning with Automotive and Discrete, our ADG. ADG revenues grew 6.6% sequentially, performing better than the company average, and grew 4.7% in comparison to the year ago quarter. ADG's operating income and operating margin improved sequentially, driving ADG's second quarter operating margin to 8.6%. For the first half, ADG revenues increased 5.1%, with its operating income up slightly and the operating margin substantially stable at 7.1%.
Looking at our product portfolio for Automotive, we see the increasing silicon content of the latest generation of cars reflected in the number of ST components present in new models. For example, in the new Audi A8, we estimate that we will contribute up to 1,000 components, coming from all areas of our broad portfolio in the Automotive.
With our focus on technologies and solutions enabling greener driving, we won important design wins related to car electrification. These included wins for silicon carbide MOSFETs, high-temperature silicon controlled rectifiers, and ultrafast diodes from OEMs, as well as from key automotive suppliers. Semiconductors content for hybrid and electric vehicles is growing fast. And we see the potential for over 50 silicon carbide dice in today's typical electric car.

We also had a number of design wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience, such as an important win for a new generation of airbag platform from a major car-safety technology leader. We also won audio-amplifier socket with a Tier 1, and we were selected as a partner by a German company for the development of a next-generation rear LED driver, targeting major global carmakers.
Moving to our power Discrete business outside Automotive. Here, we had design wins for high-voltage Super Junction devices for battery chargers with leading smartphone makers, wins with high-voltage IGBTs from many global leaders in home appliances, and wins with the ultrafast series diodes at top air-conditioning makers.
In our Analog and MEMS Groups, AMG, we saw strong revenue growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 8.9%, driven by both Analog and MEMS products. Year-over-year, AMG revenues were up 28.3% on sharply higher MEMS growth and also strong growth in Analog.
Similarly, AMG's second quarter operating margin saw strong sequential and year-over-year improvement, increasing to 14.5% from 10.1% and 0.2% in the prior and year-ago quarters, respectively. For the first-half 2017, AMG revenues increased 24.1%. Its operating margin saw a significant turnaround, reaching 12.4%, up from breakeven in the year-ago period.
Moving to the AMG products. Our MEMS sensors achieved a number of important design wins across a diverse range of applications. These included motion sensors and magnetometers in PCs and tablet, motion sensors for bike application in Asia, and a 6-axis motion sensor for a top Chinese smartphone manufacturer.
We also received first orders for waterproof pressure sensors for a smartwatch from a leading global brand and won socket for pressure sensors in multiple applications, including drones and appliances. In addition, we enlarged our family of 10-year-longevity sensors with the introduction of a 6-axis module targeting Smart Industry applications.
In sensors for our automotive telematics applications, we grew more than 30% year-over-year with customers across the globe. In wireless connectivity, we launched a new System-on-Chip Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0-certified, and also won multiple designs for a sub-gigahertz and Bluetooth Low Energy in a range of applications, including wearable, smart home and smart building automation.
The performance of our Analog business was strong during the second quarter. We achieved record quarterly sales in standard and high performance analog product families. And we introduced new advanced operational amplifiers to reinforce our position, both in Industrial and in the Automotive.
Our STSPIN motor-control family won numerous sockets globally for a broad range of Consumer and Industrial motor-control applications, including 3D printers, textile machines for smart factories, but also vacuum cleaners and fan controls.
Wireless charging has been an area of recent investment, and during the second quarter, we landed a design win for fast, wireless-charging ICs in smartphones, as well as introducing new multi-standard wireless charger ICs.
Now, let me share some highlights on our Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group, MDG, which has seen a strong overall improvement in operating result since the start of the year. On a sequential basis, MDG's revenues increased 3.3%, and year-over-year were up 10% on double-digit growth of our general purpose microcontrollers, offset in part by lower digital IC sales, including products undergoing a phase-out.
MDG's operating margin was 11.6% in the second quarter, showing sequential improvement and was up sharply compared to the year ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this improvement reflects, on the one hand, our strong performance in microcontrollers and on the other, our restructuring initiatives, that have resulted in a substantial reduction of losses from digital ICs.

First half, MDG result further demonstrate the significant progress we have made, with revenues increasing 10.7%, operating income up $126 million and its operating margin reaching 10.9%, from 0.5% in the first half of 2016.
On general purpose microcontrollers, we have seen another record quarter in Q2. To further strengthen the STM32 family product offer and ecosystem, we introduced new parts for the STM32L4 and this family features advanced capabilities in terms of audio performance. And also with this family, we can provide the new IoT Discovery kit, indeed to accelerate development of applications with direct connection to the cloud services. We also increased our support for Smart Industry applications, with a scalable industrial Ethernet platform through a cooperative effort with a German automotive solution provider.
Moving to security, we started production of our latest high-performance Near field communication controller, targeting consumer and mobile security applications. We launched a new STPay dual-interface banking solution and announced a solution for IoT Security based on STSAFE Trusted Platform Module, in cooperation with Security Platform Incorporation.
We gained wins for ST25D dynamic RFID tags in washing machines and for ST25R Near field communication reader ICs for point-of-sales terminals from major OEMs while beginning production ramp of 256 kilobit EEPROM at a top sportswear brand. We also launched the ST25DV Dynamic Near field communication/RFID Tag expansion board for the STM32 Nucleo ecosystem. In our custom silicon business, we introduced the first European independent design platform dedicated to ASICs for space applications in low-power CMOS technology, in cooperation with the European Space Agency and the French Space Agency, CNES.
We also qualified a new FD-SOI digital ASIC for a key networking OEM and captured several design wins for optical ICs at a key subsystem manufacturer for applications in data centers. To complete the review of our products, let's now discuss our Imaging Product Division, which we report in others.
As anticipated, Imaging revenues in the second quarter decreased slightly on a sequential basis to $68 million while we prepare for the ramp of new programs. On a year-over-year basis, Imaging revenues increased 60% in the second quarter, and for the first half 2017, rose 83% to $140 million driven by ST's innovative Time-of-Flight technologies.
In the second quarter, we continue to gain design wins while delivering high volumes of our FlightSense Time-of-Flight proximity and ranging sensors to multiple smartphone OEMs. We now have reached cumulative shipments of over $300 million Time-of-Flight sensors and are in more than 80 smartphone models from 15 different OEMs.
Moving now to our third quarter guidance. We anticipate continued progress in revenue growth, improvement in our operating performance and higher net income. Bookings are strong across all product groups and regions and we continue to see healthy inventory level and demand from our point-of-sales data.
Based on our current bookings activity and visibility, we expect third quarter revenues to increase about 9% on a sequential basis. This represents a year-over-year growth of about 16.6% at the midpoint of our guidance. We expect this growth to come from all our businesses, regions and sales channels. For our three product groups, we anticipate revenue growth in the third quarter to reflect higher than normal seasonality.
In our Imaging business, we anticipate strong sequential growth as the key new program ramps in Q3, followed by further revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking at 2017 overall and based on current visibility, we expect our revenues to be at the high-end of the range that we gave at the Capital Market Day, which was 14% year-over-year revenue growth plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.

Turning to gross margin, we anticipate further expansion in the third quarter to about 39% at the midpoint leading to strong year-over-year improvement in operating and net income. With respect to our 2017 free cash flow, we continue to anticipate it well substantially – that will substantially match the level of our dividend.
Additionally, let me share, some more specifics on our capital investment plans for 2017. At our Capital Markets Day in May, we indicated we were reviewing our capital spending in 2017 above our initial plans of up to $1.1 billion. Based upon a combination of new products and higher customer demand, we now anticipate capital investment in 2017 to be in the range of about $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. This investment will support both 2017 revenues and our future growth programs.
To conclude, at our Capital Markets Day, we shared with you our financial performance targets for the second half of 2017. Based upon our third quarter guidance and second half ambitions overall, we believe ST is very well positioned to reach these short-term financial target.
My colleagues and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning, everyone. Many thanks for the question. Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify exactly what Automotive revenue you saw overall, obviously that spread over several groups? That's the first point.
And then the second one was just on some of the data points you've seen out of Automotive semis globally, particularly in the U.S. we've seen some semi players and Tier 1 suppliers have some weaker data points, but you seem to be pointing to double-digit growth in coming quarters. So, just wanted to understand your view on overall global auto end market and any specifics for ST? Many thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. With the visibility that we have today, we will grow 10% in our Automotive business. And the backlog is very strong and it's very strong across all technologies. This is for our discrete sensors, certainly for smart power products, microcontrollers and all the complex digital ASICs for infotainment or the advanced safety and connectivity.
So, it's broad range and is strong. And of course, we understand that there are some fluctuations in the overall volumes, but content is increasing and with the visibility that we have today and supported really unprecedentedly strong backlog. In the Automotive, we plan to grow 10% year-over-year.
Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
That's very clear. And just to – I have one quick follow-up. We've seen some data points around wafer pricing increasing year-to-date. Wondered if you could give a perspective on what that can mean for ST, to what extent we could see any impacts and how it controlled. Many thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Carlo, the Manager of Procurement.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah, good morning, everyone. Indeed at the end of second half of 2017, it will be a period with some upside on the overall price for silicon substrate. This will affect us. It's well incorporated in our gross margin roadmap and the visibility that we are sharing with you.
With some of this supplier, we have early contract. So, I believe that perhaps it is a little bit less effect than other semiconductor companies because of this reason and overall, at the end, there are ingredients in our technology manufacturing roadmap that are exposed. But, clearly, the 200-millimeter, the-300 millimeter bulk wafers, while there are other ingredients like, for instance, the Si-substrate that became important in our volume, as you may expect, in the second half of this year that are less exposed to this price evolution.

Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
Very clear. Many thanks.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Alex. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. I have two questions, if I may? Thanks for letting me on. My first question is regarding your ASIC business. Carlo Bozotti, I mean, do you have – are you working with any major smartphone vendors at this point on major ASICs – in any major ASICs? I mean since last year, when you did the restructuring in the set-top box business, you did move some employees into a power management business and whether you are going to work in power management, ASICs, for instance, in the smartphone market?
And my second question, Carlo Ferro, is on the other revenues that you report. Your other operating income losses increased in the second quarter. I'm not entirely sure why that happened given that your gross margin improved, annual revenue improved. So, how do we model that going forward into the latter half of the year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Sandeep, yes, we have ASIC development. Of course, we have broad range of technologies and we can cover both smart power ASICs, but also digital ASICs. And indeed, we have important developments in this area.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Are you talking about the smartphone market?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
No, no, no. Yes, I'm talking about the smartphone. Yes. Absolutely. Yes.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Sandeep, to take your second question, help me, please. Is your question about the other revenues in the P&L or the revenues for the other group?
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
No. Other group which is where you report Imaging and where you historically reported losses associated with under utilization, et cetera, where it has increased from negative $14 million in Q1 to negative $28 million in Q2 as such really.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Okay. I see the question. Of course, there are two important ingredients there. One is already very evident in our results is the substantial loading of the fab. So, you make expect that the second quarter result have really a very, very minor effect of unused capacity on this line.
Then, the result of the Imaging Division is very much associated with the evolution of the product programs and time to ramp the program. I believe it's not a surprise that no new program has ramped in the course of the second quarter. And this is the reason why revenues in Q2 were sequentially lower than prior quarter. And overall, the combination of the top line and the network (31:07) to support the new program ready to start is the reason driving the operating income for the division in the second quarter. We are very confident for the second half of the year for this line.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Understood. So, this was because of costs which are not covered on new projects. Understood.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Exactly.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Sandeep. Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for my questions. So, if I look at your Q3 guidance, it implies that revenues are going to grow sequentially about $175 million. Can you help us understand like how much of that is going to come from the Others category? Like I know you can't give a precise number, but like just give us some sense whether it's like 50% of that incremental growth is driven by Others, or is it less than 50%, more than 50%. Any color around that would be helpful. Then I have a follow-up.

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Carlo?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
No, where you want to go, I would be thank to answer that from a news capacity fab loading – our revenues generation. But I'm sure that your question is different, and clearly, we cannot be, as you may understand, very, very specific on individual line and individual program.
Carlo has already indicated the trend for both the Imaging Division and the Other. And overall, three product groups – on the Other, overall three product groups, we see a sequential revenues increase higher than normal seasonality and the normal seasonality for us is between 3% and 3.5%. So, higher means that higher than that. And for the Imaging Division, we see a strong increase in the quarter, and furthermore, increase in acceleration in the fourth quarter upon the view of starting new program and the acceleration of the program more loaded in the fourth quarter than in the third.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up. On your sales guidance for the full year, obviously, you've increased – you're saying now you'll probably reach the high end of the range. Just trying to understand what are the key drivers that is making actually you more confident about that. Is it mainly autos? Because I also see that you've raised auto's guidance from 9% to 10, and probably there is some FX tailwind on the top line as well because of weak dollar. Are there any other puts and takes around that or...
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
To be candid in the answer in respect to what we told you in May, I believe, the only difference today is about the timing and to gain visibility over timing. Again, we were very confident on the status of the business in May. Given still seven months to end the year, we tend to be a little bit more prudent. Now, we have a visibility with a very reasonable set of expectations to give us comfort towards the high end of this range. Nothing, in particular, in respect to specific businesses, our area of applications have changed as order (34:50) remains quite strong.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Right. Right. And inventory at our distributors really low. So it is across the board. So, it is a good momentum in the three areas that we have, the IoT, the smartphone, for us is one area, Automotive, as we said, at 10%. And also, let's say, all of this new applications in the mass market. So we have a stronger, let's say, visibility pretty much across the board from a business point of view, but also from a regional point of view.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Carlo, and congratulations for strong results. Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Achal. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from David Mulholland from UBS. Please go ahead.
David T. Mulholland - UBS Ltd.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe similar to the vein of the last – first question. But we had a fairly clear indication from another supplier into the product ramp in H2 that the phasing would be a bit more Q4-weighted relative to Q3 on when revenue benefit might be seen from the kind of 3D sensing in H2. I wonder if you can comment on whether you see similar trends, kind of a bit more Q4-biased?
And then secondly, on the Analog and MEMS growth that you've seen – or if you'd just comment. You made a few comments on what have been the drivers behind this. But could you help us understand, distribution-wise, has this mostly been recovery in smartphones and the gains at a major Asian smartphone OEM, or is it more diverse and broad-based than that?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Again, we already gave visibility on what we expect in Q3 and we see then Q3 moving into Q4. Now, we said that in Q3, our three groups are fast imaging. (37:06) Now, they are growing more than seasonal and, as we said, our seasonality is 3% to 3.5%. So, this will be higher than that. So there will be step, of course, important step, a strong step in Imaging. And then see, for this line, an acceleration of the revenues in Q4. Now, we cannot comment more than that.

If we go to – now to AMG, I think here, we have a important traction in Analog. The traction is certain importance in distribution. And I think it is either – it is both. Our general purpose analog, on one side, but also our more specific industrial and power conversion products, including motion control products. So, this is pretty strong demand through the mass market and the distribution.
As far as MEMS is concern, Automotive is growing very rapidly, as we said, 30%, but we are not yet at the level that we would like to be in this domain of the MEMS business. I think it is important opportunity for us in the future to sell more of these products to Automotive and Industrial customers. What we are doing on the other end, on Consumer is, of course, try to diversify our base, clearly in terms of customers with more and more customers, particularly in Asia. But also in terms of product and product categories.
So, it's – again, it's pretty broad. I think for us, in Analog, it's important to keep going, because it's a great business, both in general purpose, high-end analog, the industrial and power conversion. Certain products also for computing – for computer peripherals. So, this for us is important, and we have a pretty good visibility here. And at MEMS, as I said, we want to do more in areas where margins are higher, like Industrial and Automotive, and remain well balanced in the smartphone, in terms of customers and products.
David T. Mulholland - UBS Ltd.
That's great. Thanks very much.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning, everyone. Amit Harchandani from Citi and thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. My first question is with respect to the demand in the quarter. Could you give us a sense – you've talked about inventories, but could you give us a sense for lead times and how they have shaped up, they're stable, getting stretched, whether you have seen any component shortages, and also potentially comment on the linearity of bookings during the quarter. And then I have a second follow-up. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. But certainly, lead time are stretchening. I mean we have a strong demand. The book-to-bill is very positive. And we have seen an acceleration of the bookings in the month of June, starting from a level that was already pretty high in April and in May. And of course, we also have the first three weeks of July. I can say that the run rate is pretty good also in the first three weeks of July, including last week.
So, the book-to-bill is good. Lead time are stretchening. And the inventory (41:14) distribution are low, and the trend of bookings has increased in the month of June and in the month of July compared to the months of April and May.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you. And ,as an unrelated follow-up, could I maybe get some more insight into the design wins you have talked about on the silicon carbide side? You've talked about diodes. You've talked about MOSFETs. We understand there is a strong win with an Automotive customer. Could you give us a sense for what's driving this? Is it customers embracing it? Is it competitive positioning? Any sort of insight you could give with us which would help us better quantify the opportunity would be most welcome.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. No. I think, frankly, that we are in a good leadership position with our silicon carbide. I think we want to make silicon carbide an important industrial program for this year. And I think in this respect, my opinion, of course, is that we are leading the market. And Industrial is more spread, and we certainly have opportunity in the industrial field, both with diode and with power MOS. But the volumes, and the volume potentials, in the Automotive are significantly higher.

So, we have an aggressive plan to start. I think, in Q3, sales contribution is limited. However, we have an aggressive plan and it is a very, very important program for the company to move on from what we have now with 4-inch, (43:14) 6-inch. Yields are improving. We are moving up, and there is a strong determination to make this a successful program during the second half of this year.

The next question is from Janardan Menon from Liberum. Please go ahead.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on gross margin. For a very strong 9% quarter-on-quarter growth and, Carlo Ferro, you had previously indicated that you will get a significant benefit from the second half from the increased capacity of the 300-millimeter fab, where your cost of production goes down. I was just wondering that the 39% seems a little bit on the low side, when you put all that together. Are there any headwinds that you are facing right now on gross margin, and how would you expect the gross margin progression to continue beyond Q3, based on what you know at this point in time? I have a follow-up.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Janardan, thank you for the question, since that help to highlight also two points around our 39% guidance on gross margin midpoint. This point is, again, is if I do not mistake, this is higher than consensus expectation for the second half.
And second is the opportunity of progression going forward. At the end, you have mentioned some of the driver we've discussed at Capital Markets Day about our gross margin evolution through the year, the wafer cost, particularly 300-millimeter is important. As fab ramps, there is always a continuing improvement on the learning curve. And I believe the ability of taking a full advantage of the scale of the fab at around the 5,000 wafer per week will be more evident in the production in the course of the third quarter. And as you know, there is about a one quarter lag as operating cost, manufacturing cost translates into margin out to the inventory cycle.
So at the end, it's early to anticipate a gross margin for the fourth quarter. There are a number of ingredients and variable, also depending clearly on product mix, et cetera. Overall, the visibilities that after the 39% in Q3, the progression towards Q4 will be on the positive direction.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Understood. And just a brief follow-up on the Time-of-Flight, which is in your other division. After a big jump in the second half of last year, that revenue has sort of flattened out. But you are continuously reporting higher number of models and OEM on that particular product. And now I understand that from the second half, that revenue will increase sharply because of the 3D of the special program.
But just on the Time-of-Flight itself, can you give some reason why that revenue is not really rising as a number of model. Is that price pressure coming there? Or what are the dynamics which is happening there?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
Hi. It's Jean-Marc speaking. Thank you for the question. We are simply executing timely and according to plan of record of the program. And our assessment is consistent with that.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
I think on the Time-of-Flight, we have enormous number of customers in our end. Of course, we are also working on new technologies for the Time-of-Flight. So, there would be a new wave, but we are pretty happy that the growth is impressive in Imaging and we are investing a lot for the new initiative. This is visible of course in terms of expenses in the P&L, but we have now sort (47:46) the $300 million business of Time-of-Flight that we want to keep going and we have the opportunity. I think it's pretty good and it's a pretty good business. I would say it's very good business, but in parallel, we are investing on new things and this will make – will allow us to make another important step.

Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Understood. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Adithya Metuku from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of admin questions. Firstly, could you remind us of the proportion of costs in your business that have been hedged over the next four quarters, especially given the recent moves in the euro-dollar rate. And also if you could remind us with the latest impact on your costs from the euro-dollar move given all the restructuring and the changes in the business over the last 12 months or so.
And then secondly, just a quick follow-up on the recent convertible bond offering. If you could give us some color on how we should think about the diluted share count and the impact on buybacks going forward. That would be really helpful. Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. So, I guess both questions are for me, Carlo. The one on the hedging has – overall COGS and operating expenses. Euro-denominated at the current stage, are hedged for the third quarter in the range of the 80%. So, on the $1.12 effective rate underlying, our guidance at the end, the margin of volatility is quite limited. That will be not about one figure assuming exchange rates that stays at a decent level of $1.1640.
And for the fourth quarter, we have now had over 50% of the overall exposure. And on this basis, based on current exchange rate at $1.164, you may expect for the fourth quarter an effective exchange range of about €1.14 per dollar (sic) [$1.14 per euro] (50:16).
The second part of the question is an appreciated question. As clearly, our balance sheet at the end of the months of June still is subject to some evolution. On July 3, we have closed the issuance of the new convertible bond. Then we are in the process of repurchasing 19 million shares, and we are in the process of redeeming the 2019 convertible bond.
In respect to this initiative, the current status is clearly the issuance of the convertible bond is complete, and this also give us the opportunity for an additional $1.5 million of financing if we take out the amount we are using to repurchase the underlying shares to convert assuming net share settlement at the end is $1.2 billion net amount that came with a zero cost and with zero dilution certainly strengthening the balance sheet of the company and the overall financial flexibility for the company.
Then we have the second ingredient which is the execution of the buyback. On the share buyback execution, we are at about 60% of completion. So, I would expect that when I will talk at the end of Q3 but before in the next month so the program which has been totally completed. And in respect to the redemption of the 2019 bond, the $600 million has been – the full amount has been already noticed for conversion. We are in the so called observation period which is a 20-day period.
So by the end of August, the redemption of this $600 million of tax will be reflected. To make sure to the story, you see $2 billion of available liquidity $1.99 billion in the balance sheet at the end of June on a pro forma basis including the new convert, the repurchase of the shares and the redemption of the 2019 bond at this level of liquidity would be about $2.6 billion.
And finally I guess, on your question, perhaps there is a question about the underlying shares for the shares count. And given the utilization of treasury shares to redeem the 2019 bond on one side and the buyback on the other side, what you may consider is that, at the end of June, 23.3 million shares were outstanding as treasury shares. At the end of September, after all this process of refinancing being completed, we estimate about $28 million treasury shares so, not bigger changes in the overall effect of treasury shares on the shares count.

The next question is from Jérôme Ramel from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Yeah. Good morning. A question on your manufacturing. could you give us what the capacity utilization rate was? Also, what is the current capacity in, call it, 300-millimeter? And have you already completed the program? And the CapEx increase for this year, where is it going exactly? Thank you.
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
So, thank you, Jérôme. Jean-Marc speaking. So, to be specific about, call it, 300-millimeter, I have to say that all the equipment (54:46) has been basically installed and consigned now. And the team is running full speed to reach a capacity, about 2,000 to 5,000 wafer per week in the course of this second half of this year. And overall, okay, the manufacturing machine of (55:10).
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
And the CapEx, this phase is broad, they increase – the increase that we have given or that it was preannounced, in fact, in the month of May. And today, there is some form of quantification. It is also covering area like our BCD, for instance, the smart power technologies, the silicon carbide, typically proprietary technologies, because we see important opportunities for the future, of course.
We also said however, that this extra CapEx in terms of cash flow, we would – it would be fully compensated by increased EBITDA. So, the cash flow, let's say, anticipation that we had given would not change, no? We would certainly cover the distribution of dividends, despite the increase in CapEx.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you. And maybe another follow-up, if you are fully loaded today and we should still see revenue growth in Q4. And maybe, let's say, you have some growth next year, how are you going to deal with that? Do you have extra capacity coming in? Or are you stretched from a capacity standpoint?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well first of all, we have some ambition for Q4 and we are starting to describe the ambition, but certainly with what we have in our end, in terms of capacity and in terms of the backlog, customer programs, we have moved quickly from a $7 billion company to a $9 billion company. This is happening. This is happening for real.
And of course, we have opportunity inside ST to grow, but we also have opportunity with our, let's say, silicon foundry partners. We are working internally as we described today, but we are also working externally with a number of technologies. Traditionally, this was on logic, the FD-SOI, as you know, embedded flash is also from outside. And more recently, the perimeter has become wider. We have the BCD also now.
So, you see the contribution of important programs with our silicon foundry partners and this increase of capacity internally and our really priorities to make sure that we can make another important step next year in terms of revenues.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you. Just to make clear, Carlo, with this current capacity you have and your partner fleet with your foundry, do you think you can deal with potentially a $9 billion revenue, is that what you said?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
I didn't say exactly that. I said that with the silicon foundry partners, we can certainly exceed the $9 billion.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
If I can, Jérôme, on a more, I would say, technical standpoint help on the subject, I believe that we are not referring to any target of guidance for next year...
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV

Sure.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
...which is, clearly, too early. However, certainly, the initial question about the limitation of our revenues growth in respect to the current utilization of capacity, we tried to put in the right context because there are a number of ingredients that will support and could support together with the demand, expanding revenues, as Carlo said, the sourcing of silicon from a foundry. The fact that full use of capacity in full steam it moves (59:53) then takes one quarter to translate into wafers out in our cycle.
The fact that we are accelerating capital expenditure. When you compare the $1.25 billion, $1.3 billion guidance for the year to the about $550 million spent in the first half, you'll see that there is a lot that we are receiving in these days which, clearly, will increase capacity and then, obviously, there is also on the inventory cycle. So, it's not so mathematical. It certainly is not flex (1:00:25).
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas

The next question is from Francois Meunier from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Thanks for taking my questions. Yes, just a bit more precisions around the silicon carbide MOSFETs socket wins. In which region was that? Was that in Germany? And are you seeing the more traditional competitor there trying to come back on the silicon carbide? That's the first question.
Second question on the gross margin. Actually, you know like that was a question you had earlier. I think the guidance for Q3 is pretty good. It looks like it's a 56% drop through on incremental revenues compared to 50% in Q2. So, that's pretty good. So, I think Carlo you say that Q4 would potentially be even better. So, is that basically because you expect the drop through to increase to 60% or above in Q4?
And just two other questions, if I may? Any intent to use the $1.5 billion convert you've raised at a very, very good price to increase you capabilities in VCSEL. And also – and I'm sorry, that's the fourth question, I'm really sorry. Have you heard of any double ordering taking place at the moment, end of Q2, beginning of Q3 at any of your distributors or OEMs? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. So, there are many question. Maybe, Carlo, you'll start.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
On the gross margin.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
So, I think the one on the gross margin, unfortunately, Francois, with little ability of adding in respect to what we have already anticipated and saw the opportunity of a further progression in the fourth (1:02:28) quarter than to quantify it at this stage is a bit premature as you could expect it.
Then the other of your questions was on utilization on the proceeds from the convertible bond. For what was the question is?
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
If you were willing to buy into VCSEL capabilities for your 3D sensors?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
No. No. No. No. No. We have always positioned ourselves very clear about VCSEL. You have many, many VCSEL type, okay? Big one, big (1:03:12). So, it's (1:03:16) like a strategic agreement with supplier. And this is basically, what we are doing and we have done to support our Imaging growth.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
In general, as you said, Francois, thank you for saying that at the end, we have raised money at very effective terms. And this grant is the reason why we tapped the market and the philosophy that it's better to go to take money from the market when it's easily and the cheap, as opposed of when you actually need. So, I would encourage not at all reading across the convert in to read the strategic or investment move in for the company.

Really, it's been more opportunistic than strategically needed. And of course, financial flexibility in semiconductor is always a great asset to support the growth.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
And then I think the last part is on SiC, right?
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Yes. From which region, and if you saw your more traditional competitor on power semis for autos reacting to your progress in silicon carbide?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Of course, I believe that we will see, we'll see, we will (1:04:42). It's no doubt. I think this is a great opportunity for ST. But it is a great opportunity for some of our competitors, and we need to keep that going with innovation, the industrialization, et cetera. So, I expect that there will be a strong effort from our competitors to be successful in this very, very important business. Frankly, we are working on the three regions. I think it's something that I can mention, because it is publicly known and is about China.
In China, we have signed an agreement to contribute. This is with a consortium. And they are carmakers, battery maker, also research centers, research institution in China. This is for the management of the battery for electric vehicles. I believe this is something that I can mention, because it is publicly known. I think it's a good opportunity, of course, with our BCD technology, but also for our silicon carbide.
But we are working in Asia. We are working in Europe. Of course we are working in Germany, and we are working also in United States.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Okay. Thank you. And any sign of hearing on any double ordering in microcontrollers or any standard parts?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, I think there is more than double ordering. I think what we see is anticipation of orders, particularly on microcontrollers, to make sure that the backlog is well-covered. Also, for instance, for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year.
We know, of course, very well that, on certain family, the book-to-bill ratio that we are experiencing is not sustainable. But, I think what we see is an effort to make sure that there is a good coverage in the backlog of our customers, not just for Q3 or as part of Q4, but on a longer frame of time.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc

The next question is from Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking the question. I had another one on the CapEx side of things. Yeah, I take your point that demand is strong and so it is – the rise in CapEx is covered by sort of broad-based demand. But if I go back to some of the comments you made earlier this year, so when we first saw the initial increase in CapEx, there were portions of the 2017 budgets that were quite clearly allocated to a specific project. I'm just wondering whether now that we're in the middle part of the year, we're going to see some of these ramp in the back half. How is your visibility into 2018 improving for these particular areas? And I go back to some of the points you made, Carlo Ferro, about sort of ensuring that you are going to get sort of multi-year returns on the investment being made. Just sort of further visibility into 2018 would be helpful. And I've just got a quick modeling follow-up.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Absolutely.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Andrew, at the end, the CapEx level in 2017 is clearly higher than what we have expected entering the year, but also the revenues for the year are well higher than what we were expecting. And we are really in a process of realigning capacity to demand, and increasing sourcing from silicon foundry in parallel, in order, on one side, to meet demand and on the other side, to maintain or to increase flexibility for our manufacturing machine, recognizing that clearly, the semiconductor industry remains overall exposed to some level of silica. (1:09:21) So, this is, I would say, quite wise and well-balanced move.

Then, as this evolution continues so far to be positive, based on current visibility, 2018 could be another year important in term of overall capital expenditure, however, frankly, it's very, very early at this stage to anticipate. The way that capital sourcing is execute in this industry is always at the appropriate level of modularity in order, to adjust up or down depending on the evolution of the demand, depending on the design win.
Clearly, today, also in Carlo's introduction, you had a good picture of not only strong demand, but the flow of design wins, which is important in all, and across the various technologies, including in the area of analog and power technology. And this is the reason for accelerating capital expenditure.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Okay. Thank you. And gentlemen, just a quick follow-up. In terms of OpEx modeling, previously you'd guided to the $550 million per quarter on average through the year. Can we assume that was the normal seasonality in OpEx, sort of lower in 3Q and then higher in 4Q? But does that average still hold for the year, or is it moving a bit higher, given the revenue growth?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
For the current quarter, I'll say, no major surprise in respect to the gross operating expenses, in SG&A and in R&D. Clearly, there is more activity. The exchange rate is not, as you noted, in favor, the seasonality plays in favor. Overall, what you may expect is that this quarter is a level of operating income lower than what is the normal $15 million to $18 million we report each quarter.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Not operating income.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
No, other income, sorry, of other income and expenses, sorry. Thank you, Carlo. Of other income and expenses, here on other income and expenses at the end, you may expect a few million dollar of contribution. So overall, at the end, the net operating expenses for Q3 would be slightly north of the $550 million of our target range.
Then, moving forward in Q4, you may expect some increase due to seasonality and exchange rate on the gross expenses. The other income and expenses to go back to the usual $15 million to $18 million. And as a result of that, we may be a few tenths of million dollar maximum above the $550 million reference.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
That's very clear. Thank you, Carlo.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Next question, please?

The next question is from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to a previous question about capacity. So, if you were given a new order for a special program for second half 2018, let's say at the end of this year. How would you serve that if it was, let's say, an FD-SOI ramp? Are you saying that you would serve that via foundries, or are you saying that you would migrate embedded flash out of Crolles and into foundries to clear the decks for that? And I guess I have the same question for silicon carbide, in the sense that that's currently on a 6-inch line at Catania. Is there clean room space to ramp that up, or would you need to do something with the 8-inch capacity that's there as well? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, let's start from the silicon carbide. No, the silicon carbide will stay inside. Okay. We do not have any plan to outsource the silicon carbide at all. So, as you know, at the end of last year, we moved from 4 to 6 inches, and we run this in our 6-inch module in Catania. And we intend to continue the growth of this line in Catania. On the other hand, on the 6-inch in Catania, the intention is to move more and more production, as we already described, to Asia, to Singapore for us.

On the first part of the question, while it's a combination of the two, of course, we are building up flexibility. Let's put in this way. I mean, you mentioned two important areas of flexibility. On flexibility, you mentioned flexibility on embedded flash and you mentioned flexibility on FD-SOI. And, of course, this is part of the whole manufacturing strategy. We must work from this, and we must increase this level of flexibility. And it is exactly the same for BCD. We want to have more flexibility also on the BCD.
So, as we said before it would be a combination of internal investment, but also a more extensive use of outsource, okay? So flexibility in FD-SOI, flexibility in embedded flash, on a number of generational technologies, flexibility on BCD. But certainly, let's say, on a technology pack, FD-SOI, particularly in this space, everything is and will remain inside. But flexibility to reduce the 6-inch in Catania, moving the traditional production to Singapore and making more space for the FD-SOI in case it's needed.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Got it. And just following up on that. So, then no plans for a new clean room anytime soon, in order to expand your capacity internally?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Not for new buildings. We have always opportunity to use our infrastructure better. And our, let's say, ambition is, of course, to build up more when we need in terms of capacity, using what we have, that is, I believe, possible. And of course, to continue to drive down the wafer cost.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Thanks a lot.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Mr. Veysel Taze from ODDO. Please go ahead.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Veysel Taze from ODDO. Most of the questions have been addressed. Maybe one question regarding your Auto business and the seasonality in the second half of the year. I mean, your silicon carbide design win is ramping up in Q3. So, do you expect in Q4 further seasonality growth in your Auto business?
And then on your silicon carbide business, can you share with us your design win potential of what you have right now similar to the auto microcontroller and how that has changed throughout the first half of the year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
So, again, on the silicon carbide, the ramp is now. The contribution to revenues in Q3 is limited. We expect to have an important step in Q4 of this year. And importantly, we see, let's say, significant opportunities to grow next year. I think more in general in the Automotive, as I was mentioning before, we see also a good drive in the following areas. Number one, on this smart power technologies, okay?
Number two, our microcontrollers dedicated to Automotive. I'm talking about the microcontrollers that we have in ADG. And number three, the complex digital ASICs that we now sell particularly for advanced safety applications. So, we see a good momentum on this three technology clients for Automotive. So, we expect an acceleration of the performance of our specific Automotive Group that is part of ADG – of course, it's APG, the Automotive Product Group, now part of ADG. We see an acceleration of the growth in the second part of this year, but across the board, in terms of technology coverage. This – I think, it was probably is responding to all your questions.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Yeah. The thing is also – I guess in Q4, there will be another sequential growth versus Q3. Then on the silicon carbide, really like in your auto microcontroller you have this $4 billion design win potential you mentioned. But – and just to get a color on the silicon carbide as there's a lot of moving parts there. What would you see your current design win there, just to quantify that if it's possible for you?

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
But it's not possible for me. I mean, I made the project. And example, from China because I can mention, there was a press release. I can – unfortunately, we are working in the three regions. So, we are working in Asia, we are working in Europe, of course we are working in Europe, and we are working in United States. But I cannot give more color. I mean, I tried before to give more color to this initiative in China that is important initiatives. There are six or seven (1:20:08) that are pooling on the electric cars initiative and really we have won them the battery management system and I believe we can contribute with our technologies including silicon carbide, but I cannot say more on other customers because, of course, it's confidential.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on your distribution business. I think in H1, it was 34% of revenues. What is your growth expectations for the entire year in your distribution business?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, in Q1, it was 33.8%. In Q2, it's 34.4%. So, we said these two times, 34% but in Q2 it was 34.4%, our distribution point POP, the billing and our billing to distribution customers. But more importantly, of course, is the evolution of point-of-sales.
The point-of-sale is sequentially moving from Q1 to Q2, improved by 7 percentage point. And if I look year-over-year, Q2 over Q2, the point-of-sales increased 13%. Well, we want to keep going. The inventory are low, even too low. So, we want to keep going with the point-of-sales.
I think we have two priorities in distribution. One priority is to make sure that the STM32 is more and more sticky and we have more and more products around the STM32. And of course, this is demand creation and cooperating with our distributors on the demand creation.
And the second priority is the expansion of the customer base to have more and more customers. And of course, we are consistent. I believe, we have a strategy in distribution that is very consistent and we want to keep going with this level of performance in the POS. And hopefully, contributing a little bit more to the replenishment of the inventory with our distributors that are too low.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
So, to come back on that one. What is in your 15% growth year-over-year revenue in the distribution part? What is your year-over-year growth, would you assume, here in your distribution business?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
We prefer...
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
I think you mentioned the 13% on first half, but what would be for the entire year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, I think this is an area where, of course, we need to be careful to provide information because this is not only us, but it is also the sales of our distribution. Our ambition is to keep growing with this level of growth across the board. So, that's one (1:23:15) what will be the growth at the year end. Last year was pretty positive. It was certainly very solid double-digits in 2016, and we want to repeat the performance this year. I think we do not have any sign of change, and we want to keep going. But I think it is – it will be not appropriate for us to give a POS forecast now, a point-of-sales forecast for our distributors.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

The last question is from Lee Simpson from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe if I could ask a couple of future questions just as it relates to the investments for the technology cycle. So, okay, question one. Really around that wide bandgap semi space obviously coming into power quite notably via silicon carbide including opportunities with China. But it looks to us that the sweet spot is emerging right across the voltage range for the need for higher efficiency transistors even in appliance charging. So, I'm just trying to understand how far do your ambitions go maybe in the next three to five years with wide bandgap semis would gallium nitride feature at some point? And what sort of IP datasets would you be looking for?

Second question – sorry, quick one just on digital optics for the datacenters. You mentioned some uptick there, I think, in design wins. Could you maybe just elaborate on that? Are we talking about new transceiver products for 10G-PON, that sort of thing, or are we talking about perhaps pivoting to new materials like indium phosphide? Thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Well, for the first one, yes. I think we have important ambition. We are also working on gallium nitride. We are not at the level in gallium nitride as we are in the silicon carbide, but it is an important program in R&D.
You are perfectly right. We talk a lot about Automotive, but this is broad. I think we see, particularly with, in the area of home appliances, air conditioning systems a lot of opportunities for this kind of technology. So, really. a lot of opportunities. And we see opportunities, of course, also in the Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet.
So, I think, it is an important pillar of our strategy, and we want to do much more there. And, for us, where our IGBT presence is more limited. I think the silicon carbide and the innovation in the silicon carbide; it is a great opportunity to make a step forward in this area.
To respond to the second part of the question, no. I think the bulk of this design win, it is more on very advanced BiCMOS technologies, that are used by our customers, as we mentioned, I think in my address before. To build up sub-systems, including optical sub-systems, to be used, for instance, in datacenters. But it is very advanced BiCMOS technologies and with this kind of technologies, we can certainly contribute and this is mostly ASICs. We can certainly contribute in the optical application, as we said, or let's say datacenters, for instance. But also in the new areas like the 5G. We have a wave of ASIC products, again, on BiCMOS technologies, pretty advanced BiCMOS technologies for 5G applications.
So, just to respond to your question.

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Tait, and thank you all for joining us on our second quarter and first half earnings conference call. Our agenda today includes an overview followed by a detail discussion of our results by product group, our outlook for the third quarter and our ambitions for the second half overall.
Before beginning, I want to welcome our Deputy CEO, Jean-Marc Chery to his new role, which officially started on July 2nd. I look forward to working even more closely with Jean-Marc and with our strong executive team to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth.
Let's start now with our financial review. As you have seen, we are putting together quarters of successive improvement in our financial results. The second quarter delivered further improvement with strong, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, and with operating income and net income following the same trajectory.
Revenues increased 5.6% sequentially a better than seasonal performance and 60 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 12.9% with growth coming from all product groups and sales channels.
In the Internet of Things and smartphones, we continue to win business with our complete portfolio of microcontrollers, sensors, analog and power management, connectivity and secure solutions. And IoT, our distribution channel plays a key role with point of sales in the second quarter growing 13% year-over-year. Distribution represented 34% of our revenues in Q2.

In Smart Driving, we continue to capture opportunities both with products developed in our Automotive and Discrete Group, as well as with products such as sensors and general purpose analogs which are developed by other groups and fit the need of Automotive customers. With our present visibility, we expect our overall Automotive business to grow by about 10% in 2017.
For the first half of 2017, ST's quarterly revenues were $3.74 billion, up 12.9%. Gross margin was 38.3% in the second quarter, 20 basis points above the midpoint of our range. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased by 70 basis points, positively impacted by favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by price erosion.
On a year-over-year basis, gross margin increased by 440 basis points, reflecting manufacturing efficiencies, improved fab loading and a favorable product mix partially offset by normal price pressure.
Operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased to $184 million, representing an operating margin of 9.6%, thanks to our product and profit initiatives driving operating leverage, better product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased by $50 million and $144 million respectively.
Net income in the second quarter was up sharply to $151 million, representing a sequential improvement of $43 million and, on a year-over-year basis, a swing of $128 million. First half 2017 net income totaled $258 million.
Free cash flow was $52 million in the second quarter and $113 million for the first half. This means that we can support our higher level of capital investment in 2017 from our improved cash flow from operations. Exiting the second quarter, our net financial position was $524 million, slightly up from the first quarter and higher by $98 million compared to one year ago, after having distributed $207 million in dividends.
To strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility, in July we raised $1.5 billion at an overall zero cost, through a convertible bond offering. Additionally, the combination of the net share settlement option and the ongoing repurchase of the underlining shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders. Proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes, including support for growth, and the redemption of our 2019 and 2021 convertible bonds.
Now, let's move to a detailed review of our product groups, beginning with Automotive and Discrete, our ADG. ADG revenues grew 6.6% sequentially, performing better than the company average, and grew 4.7% in comparison to the year ago quarter. ADG's operating income and operating margin improved sequentially, driving ADG's second quarter operating margin to 8.6%. For the first half, ADG revenues increased 5.1%, with its operating income up slightly and the operating margin substantially stable at 7.1%.
Looking at our product portfolio for Automotive, we see the increasing silicon content of the latest generation of cars reflected in the number of ST components present in new models. For example, in the new Audi A8, we estimate that we will contribute up to 1,000 components, coming from all areas of our broad portfolio in the Automotive.
With our focus on technologies and solutions enabling greener driving, we won important design wins related to car electrification. These included wins for silicon carbide MOSFETs, high-temperature silicon controlled rectifiers, and ultrafast diodes from OEMs, as well as from key automotive suppliers. Semiconductors content for hybrid and electric vehicles is growing fast. And we see the potential for over 50 silicon carbide dice in today's typical electric car.

We also had a number of design wins related to a more connected and safer driving experience, such as an important win for a new generation of airbag platform from a major car-safety technology leader. We also won audio-amplifier socket with a Tier 1, and we were selected as a partner by a German company for the development of a next-generation rear LED driver, targeting major global carmakers.
Moving to our power Discrete business outside Automotive. Here, we had design wins for high-voltage Super Junction devices for battery chargers with leading smartphone makers, wins with high-voltage IGBTs from many global leaders in home appliances, and wins with the ultrafast series diodes at top air-conditioning makers.
In our Analog and MEMS Groups, AMG, we saw strong revenue growth, both sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, revenues increased 8.9%, driven by both Analog and MEMS products. Year-over-year, AMG revenues were up 28.3% on sharply higher MEMS growth and also strong growth in Analog.
Similarly, AMG's second quarter operating margin saw strong sequential and year-over-year improvement, increasing to 14.5% from 10.1% and 0.2% in the prior and year-ago quarters, respectively. For the first-half 2017, AMG revenues increased 24.1%. Its operating margin saw a significant turnaround, reaching 12.4%, up from breakeven in the year-ago period.
Moving to the AMG products. Our MEMS sensors achieved a number of important design wins across a diverse range of applications. These included motion sensors and magnetometers in PCs and tablet, motion sensors for bike application in Asia, and a 6-axis motion sensor for a top Chinese smartphone manufacturer.
We also received first orders for waterproof pressure sensors for a smartwatch from a leading global brand and won socket for pressure sensors in multiple applications, including drones and appliances. In addition, we enlarged our family of 10-year-longevity sensors with the introduction of a 6-axis module targeting Smart Industry applications.
In sensors for our automotive telematics applications, we grew more than 30% year-over-year with customers across the globe. In wireless connectivity, we launched a new System-on-Chip Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0-certified, and also won multiple designs for a sub-gigahertz and Bluetooth Low Energy in a range of applications, including wearable, smart home and smart building automation.
The performance of our Analog business was strong during the second quarter. We achieved record quarterly sales in standard and high performance analog product families. And we introduced new advanced operational amplifiers to reinforce our position, both in Industrial and in the Automotive.
Our STSPIN motor-control family won numerous sockets globally for a broad range of Consumer and Industrial motor-control applications, including 3D printers, textile machines for smart factories, but also vacuum cleaners and fan controls.
Wireless charging has been an area of recent investment, and during the second quarter, we landed a design win for fast, wireless-charging ICs in smartphones, as well as introducing new multi-standard wireless charger ICs.
Now, let me share some highlights on our Microcontrollers and Digital ICs Group, MDG, which has seen a strong overall improvement in operating result since the start of the year. On a sequential basis, MDG's revenues increased 3.3%, and year-over-year were up 10% on double-digit growth of our general purpose microcontrollers, offset in part by lower digital IC sales, including products undergoing a phase-out.
MDG's operating margin was 11.6% in the second quarter, showing sequential improvement and was up sharply compared to the year ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, this improvement reflects, on the one hand, our strong performance in microcontrollers and on the other, our restructuring initiatives, that have resulted in a substantial reduction of losses from digital ICs.

First half, MDG result further demonstrate the significant progress we have made, with revenues increasing 10.7%, operating income up $126 million and its operating margin reaching 10.9%, from 0.5% in the first half of 2016.
On general purpose microcontrollers, we have seen another record quarter in Q2. To further strengthen the STM32 family product offer and ecosystem, we introduced new parts for the STM32L4 and this family features advanced capabilities in terms of audio performance. And also with this family, we can provide the new IoT Discovery kit, indeed to accelerate development of applications with direct connection to the cloud services. We also increased our support for Smart Industry applications, with a scalable industrial Ethernet platform through a cooperative effort with a German automotive solution provider.
Moving to security, we started production of our latest high-performance Near field communication controller, targeting consumer and mobile security applications. We launched a new STPay dual-interface banking solution and announced a solution for IoT Security based on STSAFE Trusted Platform Module, in cooperation with Security Platform Incorporation.
We gained wins for ST25D dynamic RFID tags in washing machines and for ST25R Near field communication reader ICs for point-of-sales terminals from major OEMs while beginning production ramp of 256 kilobit EEPROM at a top sportswear brand. We also launched the ST25DV Dynamic Near field communication/RFID Tag expansion board for the STM32 Nucleo ecosystem. In our custom silicon business, we introduced the first European independent design platform dedicated to ASICs for space applications in low-power CMOS technology, in cooperation with the European Space Agency and the French Space Agency, CNES.
We also qualified a new FD-SOI digital ASIC for a key networking OEM and captured several design wins for optical ICs at a key subsystem manufacturer for applications in data centers. To complete the review of our products, let's now discuss our Imaging Product Division, which we report in others.
As anticipated, Imaging revenues in the second quarter decreased slightly on a sequential basis to $68 million while we prepare for the ramp of new programs. On a year-over-year basis, Imaging revenues increased 60% in the second quarter, and for the first half 2017, rose 83% to $140 million driven by ST's innovative Time-of-Flight technologies.
In the second quarter, we continue to gain design wins while delivering high volumes of our FlightSense Time-of-Flight proximity and ranging sensors to multiple smartphone OEMs. We now have reached cumulative shipments of over $300 million Time-of-Flight sensors and are in more than 80 smartphone models from 15 different OEMs.
Moving now to our third quarter guidance. We anticipate continued progress in revenue growth, improvement in our operating performance and higher net income. Bookings are strong across all product groups and regions and we continue to see healthy inventory level and demand from our point-of-sales data.
Based on our current bookings activity and visibility, we expect third quarter revenues to increase about 9% on a sequential basis. This represents a year-over-year growth of about 16.6% at the midpoint of our guidance. We expect this growth to come from all our businesses, regions and sales channels. For our three product groups, we anticipate revenue growth in the third quarter to reflect higher than normal seasonality.
In our Imaging business, we anticipate strong sequential growth as the key new program ramps in Q3, followed by further revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking at 2017 overall and based on current visibility, we expect our revenues to be at the high-end of the range that we gave at the Capital Market Day, which was 14% year-over-year revenue growth plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.

Turning to gross margin, we anticipate further expansion in the third quarter to about 39% at the midpoint leading to strong year-over-year improvement in operating and net income. With respect to our 2017 free cash flow, we continue to anticipate it well substantially – that will substantially match the level of our dividend.
Additionally, let me share, some more specifics on our capital investment plans for 2017. At our Capital Markets Day in May, we indicated we were reviewing our capital spending in 2017 above our initial plans of up to $1.1 billion. Based upon a combination of new products and higher customer demand, we now anticipate capital investment in 2017 to be in the range of about $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. This investment will support both 2017 revenues and our future growth programs.
To conclude, at our Capital Markets Day, we shared with you our financial performance targets for the second half of 2017. Based upon our third quarter guidance and second half ambitions overall, we believe ST is very well positioned to reach these short-term financial target.
My colleagues and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning, everyone. Many thanks for the question. Alex Duval from Goldman Sachs. Just wanted to clarify exactly what Automotive revenue you saw overall, obviously that spread over several groups? That's the first point.
And then the second one was just on some of the data points you've seen out of Automotive semis globally, particularly in the U.S. we've seen some semi players and Tier 1 suppliers have some weaker data points, but you seem to be pointing to double-digit growth in coming quarters. So, just wanted to understand your view on overall global auto end market and any specifics for ST? Many thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. With the visibility that we have today, we will grow 10% in our Automotive business. And the backlog is very strong and it's very strong across all technologies. This is for our discrete sensors, certainly for smart power products, microcontrollers and all the complex digital ASICs for infotainment or the advanced safety and connectivity.
So, it's broad range and is strong. And of course, we understand that there are some fluctuations in the overall volumes, but content is increasing and with the visibility that we have today and supported really unprecedentedly strong backlog. In the Automotive, we plan to grow 10% year-over-year.
Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
That's very clear. And just to – I have one quick follow-up. We've seen some data points around wafer pricing increasing year-to-date. Wondered if you could give a perspective on what that can mean for ST, to what extent we could see any impacts and how it controlled. Many thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Carlo, the Manager of Procurement.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah, good morning, everyone. Indeed at the end of second half of 2017, it will be a period with some upside on the overall price for silicon substrate. This will affect us. It's well incorporated in our gross margin roadmap and the visibility that we are sharing with you.
With some of this supplier, we have early contract. So, I believe that perhaps it is a little bit less effect than other semiconductor companies because of this reason and overall, at the end, there are ingredients in our technology manufacturing roadmap that are exposed. But, clearly, the 200-millimeter, the-300 millimeter bulk wafers, while there are other ingredients like, for instance, the Si-substrate that became important in our volume, as you may expect, in the second half of this year that are less exposed to this price evolution.

Alexander Duval - Goldman Sachs International
Very clear. Many thanks.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Alex. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question is from Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. I have two questions, if I may? Thanks for letting me on. My first question is regarding your ASIC business. Carlo Bozotti, I mean, do you have – are you working with any major smartphone vendors at this point on major ASICs – in any major ASICs? I mean since last year, when you did the restructuring in the set-top box business, you did move some employees into a power management business and whether you are going to work in power management, ASICs, for instance, in the smartphone market?
And my second question, Carlo Ferro, is on the other revenues that you report. Your other operating income losses increased in the second quarter. I'm not entirely sure why that happened given that your gross margin improved, annual revenue improved. So, how do we model that going forward into the latter half of the year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Sandeep, yes, we have ASIC development. Of course, we have broad range of technologies and we can cover both smart power ASICs, but also digital ASICs. And indeed, we have important developments in this area.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Are you talking about the smartphone market?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
No, no, no. Yes, I'm talking about the smartphone. Yes. Absolutely. Yes.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Sandeep, to take your second question, help me, please. Is your question about the other revenues in the P&L or the revenues for the other group?
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
No. Other group which is where you report Imaging and where you historically reported losses associated with under utilization, et cetera, where it has increased from negative $14 million in Q1 to negative $28 million in Q2 as such really.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Okay. I see the question. Of course, there are two important ingredients there. One is already very evident in our results is the substantial loading of the fab. So, you make expect that the second quarter result have really a very, very minor effect of unused capacity on this line.
Then, the result of the Imaging Division is very much associated with the evolution of the product programs and time to ramp the program. I believe it's not a surprise that no new program has ramped in the course of the second quarter. And this is the reason why revenues in Q2 were sequentially lower than prior quarter. And overall, the combination of the top line and the network (31:07) to support the new program ready to start is the reason driving the operating income for the division in the second quarter. We are very confident for the second half of the year for this line.
Sandeep Deshpande - JPMorgan Securities Plc
Understood. So, this was because of costs which are not covered on new projects. Understood.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Exactly.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Sandeep. Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for my questions. So, if I look at your Q3 guidance, it implies that revenues are going to grow sequentially about $175 million. Can you help us understand like how much of that is going to come from the Others category? Like I know you can't give a precise number, but like just give us some sense whether it's like 50% of that incremental growth is driven by Others, or is it less than 50%, more than 50%. Any color around that would be helpful. Then I have a follow-up.

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Carlo?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
No, where you want to go, I would be thank to answer that from a news capacity fab loading – our revenues generation. But I'm sure that your question is different, and clearly, we cannot be, as you may understand, very, very specific on individual line and individual program.
Carlo has already indicated the trend for both the Imaging Division and the Other. And overall, three product groups – on the Other, overall three product groups, we see a sequential revenues increase higher than normal seasonality and the normal seasonality for us is between 3% and 3.5%. So, higher means that higher than that. And for the Imaging Division, we see a strong increase in the quarter, and furthermore, increase in acceleration in the fourth quarter upon the view of starting new program and the acceleration of the program more loaded in the fourth quarter than in the third.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. And maybe a follow-up. On your sales guidance for the full year, obviously, you've increased – you're saying now you'll probably reach the high end of the range. Just trying to understand what are the key drivers that is making actually you more confident about that. Is it mainly autos? Because I also see that you've raised auto's guidance from 9% to 10, and probably there is some FX tailwind on the top line as well because of weak dollar. Are there any other puts and takes around that or...
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
To be candid in the answer in respect to what we told you in May, I believe, the only difference today is about the timing and to gain visibility over timing. Again, we were very confident on the status of the business in May. Given still seven months to end the year, we tend to be a little bit more prudent. Now, we have a visibility with a very reasonable set of expectations to give us comfort towards the high end of this range. Nothing, in particular, in respect to specific businesses, our area of applications have changed as order (34:50) remains quite strong.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Right. Right. And inventory at our distributors really low. So it is across the board. So, it is a good momentum in the three areas that we have, the IoT, the smartphone, for us is one area, Automotive, as we said, at 10%. And also, let's say, all of this new applications in the mass market. So we have a stronger, let's say, visibility pretty much across the board from a business point of view, but also from a regional point of view.
Achal Sultania - Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, Carlo, and congratulations for strong results. Thank you.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Thank you, Achal. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from David Mulholland from UBS. Please go ahead.
David T. Mulholland - UBS Ltd.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe similar to the vein of the last – first question. But we had a fairly clear indication from another supplier into the product ramp in H2 that the phasing would be a bit more Q4-weighted relative to Q3 on when revenue benefit might be seen from the kind of 3D sensing in H2. I wonder if you can comment on whether you see similar trends, kind of a bit more Q4-biased?
And then secondly, on the Analog and MEMS growth that you've seen – or if you'd just comment. You made a few comments on what have been the drivers behind this. But could you help us understand, distribution-wise, has this mostly been recovery in smartphones and the gains at a major Asian smartphone OEM, or is it more diverse and broad-based than that?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Again, we already gave visibility on what we expect in Q3 and we see then Q3 moving into Q4. Now, we said that in Q3, our three groups are fast imaging. (37:06) Now, they are growing more than seasonal and, as we said, our seasonality is 3% to 3.5%. So, this will be higher than that. So there will be step, of course, important step, a strong step in Imaging. And then see, for this line, an acceleration of the revenues in Q4. Now, we cannot comment more than that.

If we go to – now to AMG, I think here, we have a important traction in Analog. The traction is certain importance in distribution. And I think it is either – it is both. Our general purpose analog, on one side, but also our more specific industrial and power conversion products, including motion control products. So, this is pretty strong demand through the mass market and the distribution.
As far as MEMS is concern, Automotive is growing very rapidly, as we said, 30%, but we are not yet at the level that we would like to be in this domain of the MEMS business. I think it is important opportunity for us in the future to sell more of these products to Automotive and Industrial customers. What we are doing on the other end, on Consumer is, of course, try to diversify our base, clearly in terms of customers with more and more customers, particularly in Asia. But also in terms of product and product categories.
So, it's – again, it's pretty broad. I think for us, in Analog, it's important to keep going, because it's a great business, both in general purpose, high-end analog, the industrial and power conversion. Certain products also for computing – for computer peripherals. So, this for us is important, and we have a pretty good visibility here. And at MEMS, as I said, we want to do more in areas where margins are higher, like Industrial and Automotive, and remain well balanced in the smartphone, in terms of customers and products.
David T. Mulholland - UBS Ltd.
That's great. Thanks very much.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Amit Harchandani from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning, everyone. Amit Harchandani from Citi and thanks for taking my questions. Two, if I may. My first question is with respect to the demand in the quarter. Could you give us a sense – you've talked about inventories, but could you give us a sense for lead times and how they have shaped up, they're stable, getting stretched, whether you have seen any component shortages, and also potentially comment on the linearity of bookings during the quarter. And then I have a second follow-up. Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. But certainly, lead time are stretchening. I mean we have a strong demand. The book-to-bill is very positive. And we have seen an acceleration of the bookings in the month of June, starting from a level that was already pretty high in April and in May. And of course, we also have the first three weeks of July. I can say that the run rate is pretty good also in the first three weeks of July, including last week.
So, the book-to-bill is good. Lead time are stretchening. And the inventory (41:14) distribution are low, and the trend of bookings has increased in the month of June and in the month of July compared to the months of April and May.
Amit B. Harchandani - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you. And ,as an unrelated follow-up, could I maybe get some more insight into the design wins you have talked about on the silicon carbide side? You've talked about diodes. You've talked about MOSFETs. We understand there is a strong win with an Automotive customer. Could you give us a sense for what's driving this? Is it customers embracing it? Is it competitive positioning? Any sort of insight you could give with us which would help us better quantify the opportunity would be most welcome.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. No. I think, frankly, that we are in a good leadership position with our silicon carbide. I think we want to make silicon carbide an important industrial program for this year. And I think in this respect, my opinion, of course, is that we are leading the market. And Industrial is more spread, and we certainly have opportunity in the industrial field, both with diode and with power MOS. But the volumes, and the volume potentials, in the Automotive are significantly higher.

So, we have an aggressive plan to start. I think, in Q3, sales contribution is limited. However, we have an aggressive plan and it is a very, very important program for the company to move on from what we have now with 4-inch, (43:14) 6-inch. Yields are improving. We are moving up, and there is a strong determination to make this a successful program during the second half of this year.

The next question is from Janardan Menon from Liberum. Please go ahead.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on gross margin. For a very strong 9% quarter-on-quarter growth and, Carlo Ferro, you had previously indicated that you will get a significant benefit from the second half from the increased capacity of the 300-millimeter fab, where your cost of production goes down. I was just wondering that the 39% seems a little bit on the low side, when you put all that together. Are there any headwinds that you are facing right now on gross margin, and how would you expect the gross margin progression to continue beyond Q3, based on what you know at this point in time? I have a follow-up.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Janardan, thank you for the question, since that help to highlight also two points around our 39% guidance on gross margin midpoint. This point is, again, is if I do not mistake, this is higher than consensus expectation for the second half.
And second is the opportunity of progression going forward. At the end, you have mentioned some of the driver we've discussed at Capital Markets Day about our gross margin evolution through the year, the wafer cost, particularly 300-millimeter is important. As fab ramps, there is always a continuing improvement on the learning curve. And I believe the ability of taking a full advantage of the scale of the fab at around the 5,000 wafer per week will be more evident in the production in the course of the third quarter. And as you know, there is about a one quarter lag as operating cost, manufacturing cost translates into margin out to the inventory cycle.
So at the end, it's early to anticipate a gross margin for the fourth quarter. There are a number of ingredients and variable, also depending clearly on product mix, et cetera. Overall, the visibilities that after the 39% in Q3, the progression towards Q4 will be on the positive direction.
Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Understood. And just a brief follow-up on the Time-of-Flight, which is in your other division. After a big jump in the second half of last year, that revenue has sort of flattened out. But you are continuously reporting higher number of models and OEM on that particular product. And now I understand that from the second half, that revenue will increase sharply because of the 3D of the special program.
But just on the Time-of-Flight itself, can you give some reason why that revenue is not really rising as a number of model. Is that price pressure coming there? Or what are the dynamics which is happening there?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
Hi. It's Jean-Marc speaking. Thank you for the question. We are simply executing timely and according to plan of record of the program. And our assessment is consistent with that.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
I think on the Time-of-Flight, we have enormous number of customers in our end. Of course, we are also working on new technologies for the Time-of-Flight. So, there would be a new wave, but we are pretty happy that the growth is impressive in Imaging and we are investing a lot for the new initiative. This is visible of course in terms of expenses in the P&L, but we have now sort (47:46) the $300 million business of Time-of-Flight that we want to keep going and we have the opportunity. I think it's pretty good and it's a pretty good business. I would say it's very good business, but in parallel, we are investing on new things and this will make – will allow us to make another important step.

Janardan Menon - Liberum Capital Ltd.
Understood. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Adithya Metuku from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Adithya Metuku - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of admin questions. Firstly, could you remind us of the proportion of costs in your business that have been hedged over the next four quarters, especially given the recent moves in the euro-dollar rate. And also if you could remind us with the latest impact on your costs from the euro-dollar move given all the restructuring and the changes in the business over the last 12 months or so.
And then secondly, just a quick follow-up on the recent convertible bond offering. If you could give us some color on how we should think about the diluted share count and the impact on buybacks going forward. That would be really helpful. Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. So, I guess both questions are for me, Carlo. The one on the hedging has – overall COGS and operating expenses. Euro-denominated at the current stage, are hedged for the third quarter in the range of the 80%. So, on the $1.12 effective rate underlying, our guidance at the end, the margin of volatility is quite limited. That will be not about one figure assuming exchange rates that stays at a decent level of $1.1640.
And for the fourth quarter, we have now had over 50% of the overall exposure. And on this basis, based on current exchange rate at $1.164, you may expect for the fourth quarter an effective exchange range of about €1.14 per dollar (sic) [$1.14 per euro] (50:16).
The second part of the question is an appreciated question. As clearly, our balance sheet at the end of the months of June still is subject to some evolution. On July 3, we have closed the issuance of the new convertible bond. Then we are in the process of repurchasing 19 million shares, and we are in the process of redeeming the 2019 convertible bond.
In respect to this initiative, the current status is clearly the issuance of the convertible bond is complete, and this also give us the opportunity for an additional $1.5 million of financing if we take out the amount we are using to repurchase the underlying shares to convert assuming net share settlement at the end is $1.2 billion net amount that came with a zero cost and with zero dilution certainly strengthening the balance sheet of the company and the overall financial flexibility for the company.
Then we have the second ingredient which is the execution of the buyback. On the share buyback execution, we are at about 60% of completion. So, I would expect that when I will talk at the end of Q3 but before in the next month so the program which has been totally completed. And in respect to the redemption of the 2019 bond, the $600 million has been – the full amount has been already noticed for conversion. We are in the so called observation period which is a 20-day period.
So by the end of August, the redemption of this $600 million of tax will be reflected. To make sure to the story, you see $2 billion of available liquidity $1.99 billion in the balance sheet at the end of June on a pro forma basis including the new convert, the repurchase of the shares and the redemption of the 2019 bond at this level of liquidity would be about $2.6 billion.
And finally I guess, on your question, perhaps there is a question about the underlying shares for the shares count. And given the utilization of treasury shares to redeem the 2019 bond on one side and the buyback on the other side, what you may consider is that, at the end of June, 23.3 million shares were outstanding as treasury shares. At the end of September, after all this process of refinancing being completed, we estimate about $28 million treasury shares so, not bigger changes in the overall effect of treasury shares on the shares count.

The next question is from Jérôme Ramel from Exane BNP. Please go ahead.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Yeah. Good morning. A question on your manufacturing. could you give us what the capacity utilization rate was? Also, what is the current capacity in, call it, 300-millimeter? And have you already completed the program? And the CapEx increase for this year, where is it going exactly? Thank you.
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
So, thank you, Jérôme. Jean-Marc speaking. So, to be specific about, call it, 300-millimeter, I have to say that all the equipment (54:46) has been basically installed and consigned now. And the team is running full speed to reach a capacity, about 2,000 to 5,000 wafer per week in the course of this second half of this year. And overall, okay, the manufacturing machine of (55:10).
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
And the CapEx, this phase is broad, they increase – the increase that we have given or that it was preannounced, in fact, in the month of May. And today, there is some form of quantification. It is also covering area like our BCD, for instance, the smart power technologies, the silicon carbide, typically proprietary technologies, because we see important opportunities for the future, of course.
We also said however, that this extra CapEx in terms of cash flow, we would – it would be fully compensated by increased EBITDA. So, the cash flow, let's say, anticipation that we had given would not change, no? We would certainly cover the distribution of dividends, despite the increase in CapEx.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you. And maybe another follow-up, if you are fully loaded today and we should still see revenue growth in Q4. And maybe, let's say, you have some growth next year, how are you going to deal with that? Do you have extra capacity coming in? Or are you stretched from a capacity standpoint?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well first of all, we have some ambition for Q4 and we are starting to describe the ambition, but certainly with what we have in our end, in terms of capacity and in terms of the backlog, customer programs, we have moved quickly from a $7 billion company to a $9 billion company. This is happening. This is happening for real.
And of course, we have opportunity inside ST to grow, but we also have opportunity with our, let's say, silicon foundry partners. We are working internally as we described today, but we are also working externally with a number of technologies. Traditionally, this was on logic, the FD-SOI, as you know, embedded flash is also from outside. And more recently, the perimeter has become wider. We have the BCD also now.
So, you see the contribution of important programs with our silicon foundry partners and this increase of capacity internally and our really priorities to make sure that we can make another important step next year in terms of revenues.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you. Just to make clear, Carlo, with this current capacity you have and your partner fleet with your foundry, do you think you can deal with potentially a $9 billion revenue, is that what you said?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
I didn't say exactly that. I said that with the silicon foundry partners, we can certainly exceed the $9 billion.
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas
Okay. Thank you.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
If I can, Jérôme, on a more, I would say, technical standpoint help on the subject, I believe that we are not referring to any target of guidance for next year...
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV

Sure.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
...which is, clearly, too early. However, certainly, the initial question about the limitation of our revenues growth in respect to the current utilization of capacity, we tried to put in the right context because there are a number of ingredients that will support and could support together with the demand, expanding revenues, as Carlo said, the sourcing of silicon from a foundry. The fact that full use of capacity in full steam it moves (59:53) then takes one quarter to translate into wafers out in our cycle.
The fact that we are accelerating capital expenditure. When you compare the $1.25 billion, $1.3 billion guidance for the year to the about $550 million spent in the first half, you'll see that there is a lot that we are receiving in these days which, clearly, will increase capacity and then, obviously, there is also on the inventory cycle. So, it's not so mathematical. It certainly is not flex (1:00:25).
Jérôme Ramel - Exane BNP Paribas

The next question is from Francois Meunier from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Thanks for taking my questions. Yes, just a bit more precisions around the silicon carbide MOSFETs socket wins. In which region was that? Was that in Germany? And are you seeing the more traditional competitor there trying to come back on the silicon carbide? That's the first question.
Second question on the gross margin. Actually, you know like that was a question you had earlier. I think the guidance for Q3 is pretty good. It looks like it's a 56% drop through on incremental revenues compared to 50% in Q2. So, that's pretty good. So, I think Carlo you say that Q4 would potentially be even better. So, is that basically because you expect the drop through to increase to 60% or above in Q4?
And just two other questions, if I may? Any intent to use the $1.5 billion convert you've raised at a very, very good price to increase you capabilities in VCSEL. And also – and I'm sorry, that's the fourth question, I'm really sorry. Have you heard of any double ordering taking place at the moment, end of Q2, beginning of Q3 at any of your distributors or OEMs? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. So, there are many question. Maybe, Carlo, you'll start.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
On the gross margin.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
So, I think the one on the gross margin, unfortunately, Francois, with little ability of adding in respect to what we have already anticipated and saw the opportunity of a further progression in the fourth (1:02:28) quarter than to quantify it at this stage is a bit premature as you could expect it.
Then the other of your questions was on utilization on the proceeds from the convertible bond. For what was the question is?
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
If you were willing to buy into VCSEL capabilities for your 3D sensors?
Jean-Marc Chery - STMicroelectronics NV
No. No. No. No. No. We have always positioned ourselves very clear about VCSEL. You have many, many VCSEL type, okay? Big one, big (1:03:12). So, it's (1:03:16) like a strategic agreement with supplier. And this is basically, what we are doing and we have done to support our Imaging growth.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
In general, as you said, Francois, thank you for saying that at the end, we have raised money at very effective terms. And this grant is the reason why we tapped the market and the philosophy that it's better to go to take money from the market when it's easily and the cheap, as opposed of when you actually need. So, I would encourage not at all reading across the convert in to read the strategic or investment move in for the company.

Really, it's been more opportunistic than strategically needed. And of course, financial flexibility in semiconductor is always a great asset to support the growth.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
And then I think the last part is on SiC, right?
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Yes. From which region, and if you saw your more traditional competitor on power semis for autos reacting to your progress in silicon carbide?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Of course, I believe that we will see, we'll see, we will (1:04:42). It's no doubt. I think this is a great opportunity for ST. But it is a great opportunity for some of our competitors, and we need to keep that going with innovation, the industrialization, et cetera. So, I expect that there will be a strong effort from our competitors to be successful in this very, very important business. Frankly, we are working on the three regions. I think it's something that I can mention, because it is publicly known and is about China.
In China, we have signed an agreement to contribute. This is with a consortium. And they are carmakers, battery maker, also research centers, research institution in China. This is for the management of the battery for electric vehicles. I believe this is something that I can mention, because it is publicly known. I think it's a good opportunity, of course, with our BCD technology, but also for our silicon carbide.
But we are working in Asia. We are working in Europe. Of course we are working in Germany, and we are working also in United States.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Okay. Thank you. And any sign of hearing on any double ordering in microcontrollers or any standard parts?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, I think there is more than double ordering. I think what we see is anticipation of orders, particularly on microcontrollers, to make sure that the backlog is well-covered. Also, for instance, for the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year.
We know, of course, very well that, on certain family, the book-to-bill ratio that we are experiencing is not sustainable. But, I think what we see is an effort to make sure that there is a good coverage in the backlog of our customers, not just for Q3 or as part of Q4, but on a longer frame of time.
Francois A. Meunier - Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc

The next question is from Andrew Gardiner from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking the question. I had another one on the CapEx side of things. Yeah, I take your point that demand is strong and so it is – the rise in CapEx is covered by sort of broad-based demand. But if I go back to some of the comments you made earlier this year, so when we first saw the initial increase in CapEx, there were portions of the 2017 budgets that were quite clearly allocated to a specific project. I'm just wondering whether now that we're in the middle part of the year, we're going to see some of these ramp in the back half. How is your visibility into 2018 improving for these particular areas? And I go back to some of the points you made, Carlo Ferro, about sort of ensuring that you are going to get sort of multi-year returns on the investment being made. Just sort of further visibility into 2018 would be helpful. And I've just got a quick modeling follow-up.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Absolutely.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Andrew, at the end, the CapEx level in 2017 is clearly higher than what we have expected entering the year, but also the revenues for the year are well higher than what we were expecting. And we are really in a process of realigning capacity to demand, and increasing sourcing from silicon foundry in parallel, in order, on one side, to meet demand and on the other side, to maintain or to increase flexibility for our manufacturing machine, recognizing that clearly, the semiconductor industry remains overall exposed to some level of silica. (1:09:21) So, this is, I would say, quite wise and well-balanced move.

Then, as this evolution continues so far to be positive, based on current visibility, 2018 could be another year important in term of overall capital expenditure, however, frankly, it's very, very early at this stage to anticipate. The way that capital sourcing is execute in this industry is always at the appropriate level of modularity in order, to adjust up or down depending on the evolution of the demand, depending on the design win.
Clearly, today, also in Carlo's introduction, you had a good picture of not only strong demand, but the flow of design wins, which is important in all, and across the various technologies, including in the area of analog and power technology. And this is the reason for accelerating capital expenditure.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Okay. Thank you. And gentlemen, just a quick follow-up. In terms of OpEx modeling, previously you'd guided to the $550 million per quarter on average through the year. Can we assume that was the normal seasonality in OpEx, sort of lower in 3Q and then higher in 4Q? But does that average still hold for the year, or is it moving a bit higher, given the revenue growth?
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
For the current quarter, I'll say, no major surprise in respect to the gross operating expenses, in SG&A and in R&D. Clearly, there is more activity. The exchange rate is not, as you noted, in favor, the seasonality plays in favor. Overall, what you may expect is that this quarter is a level of operating income lower than what is the normal $15 million to $18 million we report each quarter.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Not operating income.
Carlo Ferro - STMicroelectronics NV
No, other income, sorry, of other income and expenses, sorry. Thank you, Carlo. Of other income and expenses, here on other income and expenses at the end, you may expect a few million dollar of contribution. So overall, at the end, the net operating expenses for Q3 would be slightly north of the $550 million of our target range.
Then, moving forward in Q4, you may expect some increase due to seasonality and exchange rate on the gross expenses. The other income and expenses to go back to the usual $15 million to $18 million. And as a result of that, we may be a few tenths of million dollar maximum above the $550 million reference.
Andrew M. Gardiner - Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
That's very clear. Thank you, Carlo.

Next question, please?

The next question is from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to a previous question about capacity. So, if you were given a new order for a special program for second half 2018, let's say at the end of this year. How would you serve that if it was, let's say, an FD-SOI ramp? Are you saying that you would serve that via foundries, or are you saying that you would migrate embedded flash out of Crolles and into foundries to clear the decks for that? And I guess I have the same question for silicon carbide, in the sense that that's currently on a 6-inch line at Catania. Is there clean room space to ramp that up, or would you need to do something with the 8-inch capacity that's there as well? Thank you.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, let's start from the silicon carbide. No, the silicon carbide will stay inside. Okay. We do not have any plan to outsource the silicon carbide at all. So, as you know, at the end of last year, we moved from 4 to 6 inches, and we run this in our 6-inch module in Catania. And we intend to continue the growth of this line in Catania. On the other hand, on the 6-inch in Catania, the intention is to move more and more production, as we already described, to Asia, to Singapore for us.

On the first part of the question, while it's a combination of the two, of course, we are building up flexibility. Let's put in this way. I mean, you mentioned two important areas of flexibility. On flexibility, you mentioned flexibility on embedded flash and you mentioned flexibility on FD-SOI. And, of course, this is part of the whole manufacturing strategy. We must work from this, and we must increase this level of flexibility. And it is exactly the same for BCD. We want to have more flexibility also on the BCD.
So, as we said before it would be a combination of internal investment, but also a more extensive use of outsource, okay? So flexibility in FD-SOI, flexibility in embedded flash, on a number of generational technologies, flexibility on BCD. But certainly, let's say, on a technology pack, FD-SOI, particularly in this space, everything is and will remain inside. But flexibility to reduce the 6-inch in Catania, moving the traditional production to Singapore and making more space for the FD-SOI in case it's needed.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Got it. And just following up on that. So, then no plans for a new clean room anytime soon, in order to expand your capacity internally?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Not for new buildings. We have always opportunity to use our infrastructure better. And our, let's say, ambition is, of course, to build up more when we need in terms of capacity, using what we have, that is, I believe, possible. And of course, to continue to drive down the wafer cost.
Robert Sanders - Deutsche Bank AG
Thanks a lot.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV

The next question is from Mr. Veysel Taze from ODDO. Please go ahead.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Veysel Taze from ODDO. Most of the questions have been addressed. Maybe one question regarding your Auto business and the seasonality in the second half of the year. I mean, your silicon carbide design win is ramping up in Q3. So, do you expect in Q4 further seasonality growth in your Auto business?
And then on your silicon carbide business, can you share with us your design win potential of what you have right now similar to the auto microcontroller and how that has changed throughout the first half of the year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
So, again, on the silicon carbide, the ramp is now. The contribution to revenues in Q3 is limited. We expect to have an important step in Q4 of this year. And importantly, we see, let's say, significant opportunities to grow next year. I think more in general in the Automotive, as I was mentioning before, we see also a good drive in the following areas. Number one, on this smart power technologies, okay?
Number two, our microcontrollers dedicated to Automotive. I'm talking about the microcontrollers that we have in ADG. And number three, the complex digital ASICs that we now sell particularly for advanced safety applications. So, we see a good momentum on this three technology clients for Automotive. So, we expect an acceleration of the performance of our specific Automotive Group that is part of ADG – of course, it's APG, the Automotive Product Group, now part of ADG. We see an acceleration of the growth in the second part of this year, but across the board, in terms of technology coverage. This – I think, it was probably is responding to all your questions.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Yeah. The thing is also – I guess in Q4, there will be another sequential growth versus Q3. Then on the silicon carbide, really like in your auto microcontroller you have this $4 billion design win potential you mentioned. But – and just to get a color on the silicon carbide as there's a lot of moving parts there. What would you see your current design win there, just to quantify that if it's possible for you?

Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
But it's not possible for me. I mean, I made the project. And example, from China because I can mention, there was a press release. I can – unfortunately, we are working in the three regions. So, we are working in Asia, we are working in Europe, of course we are working in Europe, and we are working in United States. But I cannot give more color. I mean, I tried before to give more color to this initiative in China that is important initiatives. There are six or seven (1:20:08) that are pooling on the electric cars initiative and really we have won them the battery management system and I believe we can contribute with our technologies including silicon carbide, but I cannot say more on other customers because, of course, it's confidential.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on your distribution business. I think in H1, it was 34% of revenues. What is your growth expectations for the entire year in your distribution business?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, in Q1, it was 33.8%. In Q2, it's 34.4%. So, we said these two times, 34% but in Q2 it was 34.4%, our distribution point POP, the billing and our billing to distribution customers. But more importantly, of course, is the evolution of point-of-sales.
The point-of-sale is sequentially moving from Q1 to Q2, improved by 7 percentage point. And if I look year-over-year, Q2 over Q2, the point-of-sales increased 13%. Well, we want to keep going. The inventory are low, even too low. So, we want to keep going with the point-of-sales.
I think we have two priorities in distribution. One priority is to make sure that the STM32 is more and more sticky and we have more and more products around the STM32. And of course, this is demand creation and cooperating with our distributors on the demand creation.
And the second priority is the expansion of the customer base to have more and more customers. And of course, we are consistent. I believe, we have a strategy in distribution that is very consistent and we want to keep going with this level of performance in the POS. And hopefully, contributing a little bit more to the replenishment of the inventory with our distributors that are too low.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
So, to come back on that one. What is in your 15% growth year-over-year revenue in the distribution part? What is your year-over-year growth, would you assume, here in your distribution business?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
We prefer...
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
I think you mentioned the 13% on first half, but what would be for the entire year?
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Well, I think this is an area where, of course, we need to be careful to provide information because this is not only us, but it is also the sales of our distribution. Our ambition is to keep growing with this level of growth across the board. So, that's one (1:23:15) what will be the growth at the year end. Last year was pretty positive. It was certainly very solid double-digits in 2016, and we want to repeat the performance this year. I think we do not have any sign of change, and we want to keep going. But I think it is – it will be not appropriate for us to give a POS forecast now, a point-of-sales forecast for our distributors.
Veysel Taze - ODDO SEYDLER BANK AG
Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
Tait Sorensen - STMicroelectronics NV
Okay. Based on time, we'll take one more question, please.
Operator
The last question is from Lee Simpson from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.
Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe if I could ask a couple of future questions just as it relates to the investments for the technology cycle. So, okay, question one. Really around that wide bandgap semi space obviously coming into power quite notably via silicon carbide including opportunities with China. But it looks to us that the sweet spot is emerging right across the voltage range for the need for higher efficiency transistors even in appliance charging. So, I'm just trying to understand how far do your ambitions go maybe in the next three to five years with wide bandgap semis would gallium nitride feature at some point? And what sort of IP datasets would you be looking for?

Second question – sorry, quick one just on digital optics for the datacenters. You mentioned some uptick there, I think, in design wins. Could you maybe just elaborate on that? Are we talking about new transceiver products for 10G-PON, that sort of thing, or are we talking about perhaps pivoting to new materials like indium phosphide? Thanks.
Carlo Bozotti - STMicroelectronics NV
Yeah. Well, for the first one, yes. I think we have important ambition. We are also working on gallium nitride. We are not at the level in gallium nitride as we are in the silicon carbide, but it is an important program in R&D.
You are perfectly right. We talk a lot about Automotive, but this is broad. I think we see, particularly with, in the area of home appliances, air conditioning systems a lot of opportunities for this kind of technology. So, really. a lot of opportunities. And we see opportunities, of course, also in the Industry 4.0, the Industrial Internet.
So, I think, it is an important pillar of our strategy, and we want to do much more there. And, for us, where our IGBT presence is more limited. I think the silicon carbide and the innovation in the silicon carbide; it is a great opportunity to make a step forward in this area.
To respond to the second part of the question, no. I think the bulk of this design win, it is more on very advanced BiCMOS technologies, that are used by our customers, as we mentioned, I think in my address before. To build up sub-systems, including optical sub-systems, to be used, for instance, in datacenters. But it is very advanced BiCMOS technologies and with this kind of technologies, we can certainly contribute and this is mostly ASICs. We can certainly contribute in the optical application, as we said, or let's say datacenters, for instance. But also in the new areas like the 5G. We have a wave of ASIC products, again, on BiCMOS technologies, pretty advanced BiCMOS technologies for 5G applications.
So, just to respond to your question.
Lee Simpson - Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd.

History[edit]
STMicroelectronics was formed in 1987 by the merger of semiconductor companies SGS Microelettronica (Società Generale Semiconduttori) of Italy and Thomson Semiconducteurs, the semiconductor arm of France's Thomson. At the time of the merger the company was known as SGS-THOMSON but took its current name in May 1998 following the withdrawal of Thomson SA as an owner.
SGS Microelettronica and Thomson Semiconducteurs were both long-established semiconductor companies. SGS Microelettronica originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies:

ATES (Aquila Tubi e Semiconduttori), a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in the Abruzzese city of l'Aquila, which in 1961 changed its name to Azienda Tecnica ed Elettronica del Sud and relocated its manufacturing plant to the outskirts of the Sicilian city of Catania
Società Generale Semiconduttori (founded in 1957 by Adriano Olivetti).

Thomson Semiconducteurs was created in 1982 by the French government's widespread nationalisation of industries. It included:

the semiconductor activities of the French electronics company Thomson.
Mostek, a US company founded in 1969 by some ex-employees of Texas Instruments.
Silec, founded in 1977.
Eurotechnique founded in 1979 in Rousset, Bouches-du-Rhône as a joint-venture between Saint-Gobain of France and US-based National Semiconductor.
EFCIS, founded in 1977.
SESCOSEM, founded in 1969.

After its creation by merger in 1987, SGS-Thomson was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around US$850 million. The company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation, with acquisitions including:

In 1989, British company Inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent Thorn EMI.
In 1994, Canada-based Nortel's semiconductor activities.
In 2002, Alcatel's Microelectronics division, which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as UK company, Synad Ltd, helped the company expand into the Wireless-LAN market.
In 2007, US-based Genesis Microchip.[5][6] Genesis Microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology (Faroudja) and has design centres located in Santa Clara, Toronto, Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C. and Bangalore.

On December 8, 1994, the company completed its initial public offering on the Paris and New York stock exchanges. Owner Thomson SA sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the Borsa Italiana in Milan.
Buy-out of VLSI Vision Ltd.
In 2002, Motorola and TSMC joined ST and Philips in a new technology partnership. The Crolles2 Alliance was created with a new 12" wafer manufacturing facility located in Crolles (France).
By 2005, STMicroelectronics was ranked fifth, behind Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments and Toshiba, but ahead of Infineon, Renesas, NEC, NXP, and Freescale. The company was the largest European semiconductors supplier, ahead of Infineon and NXP.
Early in 2007, NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors) and Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductors) decided to stop their participation in Crolles2 Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement the Alliance came to an end on December 31, 2007.[7]
On May 22, 2007, ST and Intel created a joint venture in the memory application called Numonyx. This new company merged ST and Intel Flash Memory activities.
Semiconductor market consolidation continued with ST and NXP announcing on April 10, 2008, the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities, with ST owning 80% of the new company and NXP 20%. This joint venture began on August 20, 2008.
On February 10, 2009, ST Ericsson, a joint venture bringing together ST-NXP Wireless and Ericsson Mobile Platforms, was established.
In 2011, STMicroelectronics announced the creation of a joint lab with Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. The lab will focus on research and innovation in bio-robotics, smart systems and microelectronics.[8] Past collaborations with Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies included DustBot, a platform that integrated self-navigating "service robots" for waste collection.[8]
ST Ericsson was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors, supplying to mobile device manufacturers.[9] ST-Ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson and STMicroelectronics established on February 3, 2009, and dissolved on August 2, 2013. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, it was a fabless company, outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies.
Shareholders[edit]
As of December 31, 2014, the shareholders were:[3]

68.4% public (New York Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, Borsa Italiana Milano)
4.1% treasury shares
27.6% STMicroelectronics Holding B.V.

50% FT1CI (Bpifrance 79.2% and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) 20.8%; previously Areva and CEA[citation needed])
50% Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze of Italy (Finmeccanica until 2004, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti until 2010, both between 2004-2009)[citation needed]



Company structure[edit]
Following an earlier failure, STMicroelectronics has stayed out of the volatile markets for DRAM and PC microprocessors. In 1994, it attempted to launch compatible Intel 80486 microprocessors in partnership with American company Cyrix. Only model one was completed, the 1995 Cyrix M1 microprocessor, which was intended to compete with Intel's Pentium family.[citation needed]
It did achieve some success, however, in the PC-compatible x86 embedded systems market with its STPC SoC line, culminating in the 486-class STPC Atlas, which reached end-of-life in 2008.
Manufacturing facilities[edit]
Unlike so-called fabless semiconductor companies, STMicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs. The company owned five 8 inch (200 mm) wafer fabs and one 12 inch (300 mm) wafer fab in 2006.[citation needed] Most of the production is scaled at 0.18 µm, 0.13 µm, 90 nm and 65 nm (measurements of transistor gate length). STMicroelectronics also owns back-end plants, where silicon dies are assembled and bonded into plastic or ceramic packages.[10]
Major sites include:[citation needed]
Grenoble, France[edit]
Grenoble is one of the company's most important R&D centres, employing around 4,000 staff. The Polygone site employs 2200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company (ex SGS). All the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions (marketing, design, industrialization) and an important R&D center, focused on silicon and software design and fab process development.
The Crolles site hosts a 200 mm (8 in) and a 300 mm (12 in) fab and was originally built as a common R&D center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 Grenoble 92 partnership between SGS-Thomson and CNET, the R&D center of French telecom company France Telecom. The 200 mm (8 in) fab, known as Crolles 1, is the company's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between SGS-Thomson and Philips to develop new manufacturing technologies. Crolles 1 was opened on September 9, 1993 by Gérard Longuet, French minister for industry.
The 300 mm (12 in) fab was inaugurated by French president Jacques Chirac, on February 27, 2003. It includes a R&D center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 nm to 32 nm scale using 300 mm (12 in) wafers and it was developed for The Crolles 2 Alliance'. This alliance of STMicroelectronics, TSMC, NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips semiconductor) and Freescale (formerly Motorola semiconductor) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development. The technologies developed at the facility were also used by global semiconductor foundry TSMC of Taiwan, allowing TSMC to build the products developed in Crolles on behalf of the Alliance partners who required such foundry capacity. A new fab is under construction since 2015.
Rousset, France[edit]
Employing around 3,000 staff, Rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards, microcontrollers, and EEPROM as well as several R&D centers. Rousset also hosts an 8-inch (200 mm) fab which was opened on May 15, 2000 by French prime minister Lionel Jospin.
The site opened in 1979 as a 100 mm (3.9 in) fab operated by Eurotechnique, a joint venture between Saint Gobain of France and National Semiconductor of the US. Rousset was sold to Thomson-CSF in 1982 as part of the French government's 1981-82 nationalization of several industries. As part of the nationalisation, a former Thomson plant in the center of Aix-en-Provence operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new Rousset site. The original 100 mm (4 in) fab was upgraded into 130 mm (5 in) and later 150 mm (6 in) fab in 1996. It is now being shut down.
In 1988, a small group of employees from the Thomson Rousset plant (including the director, Marc Lassus) founded a start-up company, Gemalto (formerly known as Gemplus) which became a leader in the smartcard industry.
Tours, France[edit]
Employing 1,500 staff, this site hosts a fab and R&D centers.[citation needed]
Milan, Italy[edit]
Employing 6,000 staff, the Milan facilities match Grenoble in importance. Agrate Brianza (map), employs around 4000 staff and is a historical base of the company (ex SGS). The site has several fab lines (including an 300 mm (12 in) fab) and an R&D center. Castelletto, employs 300 to 400 staff and hosts some divisions and R&D centers.
Update-2012: Numonyx JV (with Intel) is acquired by Micron As such, R2 Fab (Agrate previous R&D 200mm Fab) is currently a Micron entity
Catania, Italy[edit]
The Catania plant in Sicily employs 5,000 staff and hosts several R&D centers and divisions, focusing on flash memory technologies as well as two fabs. The plant was launched in 1961 by ATES to supply under licensing to RCA of the US and initially using Germanium. The site's two major wafer fabs are a 200 mm (8 in) fab, opened in April 1997 by Romano Prodi, president of the Italian council and a 300 mm (12 in) fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to Numonyx in 2008.
Kirkop, Malta[edit]
ST employs some 1,500 people in Malta, making it the largest private sector employer. It is also the country's leading exporter.[11]
Ang Mo Kio, Singapore[edit]
In 1970, SGS created its first assembly back-end plant in Singapore, in the area of Toa Payoh. Then in 1981, SGS decided to build a wafer fab in Singapore. The Singapore technical engineers have been trained in Italy and the fab of Ang Mo Kio started to produce its first wafers in 1984. Converted up to 200 mm (8 in) fab, this is now an important 200 mm (8 in) wafer fab of the group. Ang Mo Kio also hosts some design centers. The site currently employs 6000 staff.[citation needed]
Update-2012: Numonyx JV (with Intel) is acquired by Micron in 2010. As such, AMK8 Fab (200mm HVM Fab) is currently a Micron entity. AMK5 and AMK6 remains to be STM entities.
Tunis, Tunisia[edit]

History[edit]
STMicroelectronics was formed in 1987 by the merger of semiconductor companies SGS Microelettronica (Società Generale Semiconduttori) of Italy and Thomson Semiconducteurs, the semiconductor arm of France's Thomson. At the time of the merger the company was known as SGS-THOMSON but took its current name in May 1998 following the withdrawal of Thomson SA as an owner.
SGS Microelettronica and Thomson Semiconducteurs were both long-established semiconductor companies. SGS Microelettronica originated in 1972 from a previous merger of two companies:

ATES (Aquila Tubi e Semiconduttori), a vacuum tube and semiconductor maker headquartered in the Abruzzese city of l'Aquila, which in 1961 changed its name to Azienda Tecnica ed Elettronica del Sud and relocated its manufacturing plant to the outskirts of the Sicilian city of Catania
Società Generale Semiconduttori (founded in 1957 by Adriano Olivetti).

Thomson Semiconducteurs was created in 1982 by the French government's widespread nationalisation of industries. It included:

the semiconductor activities of the French electronics company Thomson.
Mostek, a US company founded in 1969 by some ex-employees of Texas Instruments.
Silec, founded in 1977.
Eurotechnique founded in 1979 in Rousset, Bouches-du-Rhône as a joint-venture between Saint-Gobain of France and US-based National Semiconductor.
EFCIS, founded in 1977.
SESCOSEM, founded in 1969.

After its creation by merger in 1987, SGS-Thomson was ranked 14th among the top 20 semiconductor suppliers with sales of around US$850 million. The company has participated in the consolidation of the semiconductor industry since its formation, with acquisitions including:

In 1989, British company Inmos known for its transputer microprocessors from parent Thorn EMI.
In 1994, Canada-based Nortel's semiconductor activities.
In 2002, Alcatel's Microelectronics division, which along with the incorporation of smaller ventures such as UK company, Synad Ltd, helped the company expand into the Wireless-LAN market.
In 2007, US-based Genesis Microchip.[5][6] Genesis Microchip is known for their strength in video processing technology (Faroudja) and has design centres located in Santa Clara, Toronto, Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C. and Bangalore.

On December 8, 1994, the company completed its initial public offering on the Paris and New York stock exchanges. Owner Thomson SA sold its stake in the company in 1998 when the company also listed on the Borsa Italiana in Milan.
Buy-out of VLSI Vision Ltd.
In 2002, Motorola and TSMC joined ST and Philips in a new technology partnership. The Crolles2 Alliance was created with a new 12" wafer manufacturing facility located in Crolles (France).
By 2005, STMicroelectronics was ranked fifth, behind Intel, Samsung, Texas Instruments and Toshiba, but ahead of Infineon, Renesas, NEC, NXP, and Freescale. The company was the largest European semiconductors supplier, ahead of Infineon and NXP.
Early in 2007, NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors) and Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductors) decided to stop their participation in Crolles2 Alliance. Under the terms of the agreement the Alliance came to an end on December 31, 2007.[7]
On May 22, 2007, ST and Intel created a joint venture in the memory application called Numonyx. This new company merged ST and Intel Flash Memory activities.
Semiconductor market consolidation continued with ST and NXP announcing on April 10, 2008, the creation of a new joint venture of their mobile activities, with ST owning 80% of the new company and NXP 20%. This joint venture began on August 20, 2008.
On February 10, 2009, ST Ericsson, a joint venture bringing together ST-NXP Wireless and Ericsson Mobile Platforms, was established.
In 2011, STMicroelectronics announced the creation of a joint lab with Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. The lab will focus on research and innovation in bio-robotics, smart systems and microelectronics.[8] Past collaborations with Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies included DustBot, a platform that integrated self-navigating "service robots" for waste collection.[8]
ST Ericsson was a multinational manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors, supplying to mobile device manufacturers.[9] ST-Ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson and STMicroelectronics established on February 3, 2009, and dissolved on August 2, 2013. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, it was a fabless company, outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies.
Shareholders[edit]
As of December 31, 2014, the shareholders were:[3]

68.4% public (New York Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, Borsa Italiana Milano)
4.1% treasury shares
27.6% STMicroelectronics Holding B.V.

50% FT1CI (Bpifrance 79.2% and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) 20.8%; previously Areva and CEA[citation needed])
50% Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze of Italy (Finmeccanica until 2004, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti until 2010, both between 2004-2009)[citation needed]



Company structure[edit]
Following an earlier failure, STMicroelectronics has stayed out of the volatile markets for DRAM and PC microprocessors. In 1994, it attempted to launch compatible Intel 80486 microprocessors in partnership with American company Cyrix. Only model one was completed, the 1995 Cyrix M1 microprocessor, which was intended to compete with Intel's Pentium family.[citation needed]
It did achieve some success, however, in the PC-compatible x86 embedded systems market with its STPC SoC line, culminating in the 486-class STPC Atlas, which reached end-of-life in 2008.
Manufacturing facilities[edit]
Unlike so-called fabless semiconductor companies, STMicroelectronics owns and operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs. The company owned five 8 inch (200 mm) wafer fabs and one 12 inch (300 mm) wafer fab in 2006.[citation needed] Most of the production is scaled at 0.18 µm, 0.13 µm, 90 nm and 65 nm (measurements of transistor gate length). STMicroelectronics also owns back-end plants, where silicon dies are assembled and bonded into plastic or ceramic packages.[10]
Major sites include:[citation needed]
Grenoble, France[edit]
Grenoble is one of the company's most important R&D centres, employing around 4,000 staff. The Polygone site employs 2200 staff and is one of the historical bases of the company (ex SGS). All the historical wafer fab lines are now closed but the site hosts the headquarters of many divisions (marketing, design, industrialization) and an important R&D center, focused on silicon and software design and fab process development.
The Crolles site hosts a 200 mm (8 in) and a 300 mm (12 in) fab and was originally built as a common R&D center for submicrometre technologies as part of the 1990 Grenoble 92 partnership between SGS-Thomson and CNET, the R&D center of French telecom company France Telecom. The 200 mm (8 in) fab, known as Crolles 1, is the company's first and was built as part of a 1991 partnership between SGS-Thomson and Philips to develop new manufacturing technologies. Crolles 1 was opened on September 9, 1993 by Gérard Longuet, French minister for industry.
The 300 mm (12 in) fab was inaugurated by French president Jacques Chirac, on February 27, 2003. It includes a R&D center which focuses on developing new nanometric technology processes for 90 nm to 32 nm scale using 300 mm (12 in) wafers and it was developed for The Crolles 2 Alliance'. This alliance of STMicroelectronics, TSMC, NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips semiconductor) and Freescale (formerly Motorola semiconductor) partnered in 2002 to develop the facility and to work together on process development. The technologies developed at the facility were also used by global semiconductor foundry TSMC of Taiwan, allowing TSMC to build the products developed in Crolles on behalf of the Alliance partners who required such foundry capacity. A new fab is under construction since 2015.
Rousset, France[edit]
Employing around 3,000 staff, Rousset hosts several division headquarters including smartcards, microcontrollers, and EEPROM as well as several R&D centers. Rousset also hosts an 8-inch (200 mm) fab which was opened on May 15, 2000 by French prime minister Lionel Jospin.
The site opened in 1979 as a 100 mm (3.9 in) fab operated by Eurotechnique, a joint venture between Saint Gobain of France and National Semiconductor of the US. Rousset was sold to Thomson-CSF in 1982 as part of the French government's 1981-82 nationalization of several industries. As part of the nationalisation, a former Thomson plant in the center of Aix-en-Provence operating since the 1960s was closed and staff were transferred to the new Rousset site. The original 100 mm (4 in) fab was upgraded into 130 mm (5 in) and later 150 mm (6 in) fab in 1996. It is now being shut down.
In 1988, a small group of employees from the Thomson Rousset plant (including the director, Marc Lassus) founded a start-up company, Gemalto (formerly known as Gemplus) which became a leader in the smartcard industry.
Tours, France[edit]
Employing 1,500 staff, this site hosts a fab and R&D centers.[citation needed]
Milan, Italy[edit]
Employing 6,000 staff, the Milan facilities match Grenoble in importance. Agrate Brianza (map), employs around 4000 staff and is a historical base of the company (ex SGS). The site has several fab lines (including an 300 mm (12 in) fab) and an R&D center. Castelletto, employs 300 to 400 staff and hosts some divisions and R&D centers.
Update-2012: Numonyx JV (with Intel) is acquired by Micron As such, R2 Fab (Agrate previous R&D 200mm Fab) is currently a Micron entity
Catania, Italy[edit]
The Catania plant in Sicily employs 5,000 staff and hosts several R&D centers and divisions, focusing on flash memory technologies as well as two fabs. The plant was launched in 1961 by ATES to supply under licensing to RCA of the US and initially using Germanium. The site's two major wafer fabs are a 200 mm (8 in) fab, opened in April 1997 by Romano Prodi, president of the Italian council and a 300 mm (12 in) fab that has never been completed and which was transferred in its current state to Numonyx in 2008.
Kirkop, Malta[edit]
ST employs some 1,500 people in Malta, making it the largest private sector employer. It is also the country's leading exporter.[11]
Ang Mo Kio, Singapore[edit]
In 1970, SGS created its first assembly back-end plant in Singapore, in the area of Toa Payoh. Then in 1981, SGS decided to build a wafer fab in Singapore. The Singapore technical engineers have been trained in Italy and the fab of Ang Mo Kio started to produce its first wafers in 1984. Converted up to 200 mm (8 in) fab, this is now an important 200 mm (8 in) wafer fab of the group. Ang Mo Kio also hosts some design centers. The site currently employs 6000 staff.[citation needed]
Update-2012: Numonyx JV (with Intel) is acquired by Micron in 2010. As such, AMK8 Fab (200mm HVM Fab) is currently a Micron entity. AMK5 and AMK6 remains to be STM entities.

      Carlo Bozotti, President and Chief Executive Officer, STMicroelectronics: Q2 2017 Earnings Results
    

      Wednesday, July 26, 2017 - FINAL
    
    
    
      Thank you for joining us on our Second Quarter and First Half earnings' conference call. Our agenda today includes an overview, followed by a detailed discussion of our results by product group, our outlook for the third quarter, and our ambitions for the second half overall.
    
    
    
      Before beginning, I want to welcome our Deputy CEO Jean-Marc Chery to his new role, which officially started on July 2nd. I look forward to working even more closely with Jean-Marc and with our strong executive team to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth.
    
    
    
Top Company Interviews


      Let's start now with our financial review. As you have seen, we are putting together quarters of successive improvement in our financial results. The second quarter delivered further improvement, with strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, and with operating income and net income following the same trajectory.
    
    
    

        
          Revenues increased 5.6% sequentially, a better than seasonal performance and 60 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 12.9%, with growth
        
      

    
      coming from all product groups and sales channels. In the Internet of Things and smartphones, we continue to win business with our complete portfolio of microcontrollers, sensors, analog and power management, connectivity and secure solutions. In IoT, our distribution channel plays a key role, with point-of-sales in the second quarter growing 13% year-over-year. Distribution represented 34% of our revenues in Q2.
    
    
    
      In Smart Driving, we continue to capture opportunities both with products developed in our Automotive and Discrete Group, as well as with products -such as sensors and general purpose analog- which are developed by other Groups and fit the needs of automotive customers. With our present visibility, we expect our overall automotive business to grow by about 10% in 2017.
    
    
    
      For the first half of 2017, ST's total revenues were $3.74 billion, up 12.9%.
    
    
    

        
          Gross margin was 38.3% in the second quarter, 20 basis points above the mid-point of our range. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased by 70 basis points, positively impacted by favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by price erosion.
        
        
          On a year-over-year basis, gross margin increased by 440 basis points, reflecting manufacturing efficiencies, improved fab loading and favorable product mix, partially offset by normal price pressure.
        
        
      

        
          Operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased to $184 million, representing an operating margin of 9.6%, thanks to our product and profit initiatives driving operating leverage, better product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, operating income before impairment and restructuring charges increased by $50 million and $144 million, respectively.
        
        
      

        
          Net income in the second quarter was up sharply to $151 million, representing a sequential improvement of $43 million and, on a year- over-year basis, a swing of $128 million. First half 2017 net income totaled $258 million.
        
        
      

        
          Free cash flow was $52 million in the second quarter and $113 million for the First Half. This means that we can support our higher level of capital investments in 2017 from our improved cash flow from operations.
        
        

            
              Exiting the second quarter our net financial position was $524 million, slightly up from the first quarter and higher by $98 million compared to one year ago, after having distributed $207 million in dividends.
            
            
          

            
              To strengthen our capital structure and further enhance our financial flexibility, in July we raised $1.5 billion at an overall zero cost, through a convertible bond offering. Additionally, the combination of the net share settlement option and the on-going repurchase of the underlying shares implies substantially no dilution at conversion to shareholders. Proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be used for general corporate purposes, including support for growth and the redemption of our 2019 and 2021 convertible bonds.
            
          



    
    
      Now let's move to a detailed review of our product groups beginning with Automotive and Discrete (ADG).
    
    
    
      ADG revenues grew 6.6% sequentially, performing better than the Company average, and grew 4.7% in comparison to the year-ago quarter. ADG's operating income and operating margin improved sequentially, driving ADG's second quarter operating margin to 8.6%.
