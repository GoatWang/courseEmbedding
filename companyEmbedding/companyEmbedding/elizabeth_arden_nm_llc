I am one that has always used good products on my skin, however will be 60 years old in Feb. 2013 and showing some signs of aging and bought the Prevage skincare serum and moisturizer and eye cream and really liking the way it makes my face look and feel. I use the clarisonic face scrubber twice daily and that is helpful to deep cleanse the face so skincare products absorb much better. Cannot wait to see how much total improvement I will see for fine lines and few age spots and expression lines . Everything is plumping up and feels smoother and softer and looks better which makes makeup go on nicer and a more flawless look. I have good genetics and have always looked younger than my age but I do give credit to good skincare and good and proven products
Yes, I recommend this product.

There is no cleanser for this line. The serum and day lotion clog my pores. There has been no visible improvement in discolorations after months of use even with the Clarity targeted treatment.

I have used the serum, eye serum, face cream and cleanser so far. After just a few uses I can see the improvement in skin tone, more supple. Lines are less visible, skin plumper. I have used other high end skin products but Prevage seems to work better and faster than others I have tried. I would definitely recommend it for dry or aging skin.
Yes, I recommend this product.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

I went on a whim, using a half off special for deep conditioning and cut. My old stylist moved, so I was looking for a new salon, so I gave it a shot. I saw Felicia, who is awesome. Every time I have brought in a picture - for either a style or color I wanted - and she was able to give me exactly what I was asking for. My old stylist (that I paid a TON of money to) never was able to do that. She took her time, never rushed, and it always comes out great. I even recommended her to a friend, and she loved the cut and highlights she received as well. The prices are more than reasonable, especially for the quality cut you receive. The atmosphere is friendly - if you are wanting a posh/swanky ultra salon experience, then don't go here. And I say that in a good way  - I never felt comfortable and relaxed in fancy salons like that. At Shear Talent, you will get a relaxed, clean, comfortable environment where you feel like you can actually speak up and ask for what you want. Another plus is I am always able to book an appointment easily, thanks to their Saturday hours. Other places make you book months in advance - which I hate. Here I can usually call and get an appointment a week in advance, if not sooner which is awesome when I just get a sudden urge to cut my hair. Overall, a great place that I will keep returning to. Shear Talentavriggs26 ratedMy sister and I get our hair d...My sister and I get our hair done by Felicia. She does an awesome job on hilights, cut and style. I got my hilights done and wanted a light brown on my med brown hair but when all was done and I got home and styled it, it looked too light for me so I called Felicia and asked her what we could do and she said to come back in and she would put a toner on it and darken it. It came out great after that. She didnt charge me for anything and always styles my hair. I always tell her thats ok I'm just going straight home...you dont have to style it. LOL she never lets me leave looking a mess. :) Even when my hair is damaged from my own doing she does everything she can to help me get it back into shape. I love the whole theme of the salon also. They have always taken my credit card and debit card so not sure what the situation was with the past reviews. Thanks Shear Talent!Shear Talentmichaelamontes ratedThis is one of the greatest pl...This is one of the greatest places to get a cut in Las Cruces, hands down. I went and saw Vanessa, and she did an AMAZING JOB. I have curly hair that I often straighten, and usually when I get my hair done, a lot of the pieces end up looking really jagged, and longer than the others :( Vanessa is amazing! She is so friendly and sweet, I felt so comfortable talking to her. She took the ideas I gave her and gave me an amazing cut! I have a cut that is a bit harder to maintain and keep looking good for extended periods of time (an undercut(half of the head is shaved, kinda like a half mohawk)) My hair looked FANTASTIC after she was done with it! She was knowledgeable, the style looks awesome. Anytime you can get down to Shear Talent, I recommend it. Great prices and even better stylists.Tami & Co Studio 105Sarah B. ratedProfessional Quality ServiceI was a referral to this salon and to Tami.  I wanted to first go in for just a consultation without a service & Tami was very open to scheduling that for me.  My previous stylist has always done the same thing on me for years.  I might be 65 but I don't want to be 65 and Tami gave me a great more modern pixie that suited me and my busy life.Tami has a flare for short cuts and gets to know who you are to give you a cut & style that best suits your lifestyle.I scheduled for my color and needless to say, not only was I pleased with my cut, but my color was beautiful.  Tami obviously cares.  It shows in her work and her salon.  A great place to relax and have confidence in the service you receive.Shear Talentsnelli ratedGreat!!!! Jenny, owner, has be...Great!!!! Jenny, owner, has been my stylist since moving to Las Cruces almost four years ago. During the past four years, I've attempted long hair to short hair(several styles), different shades of highlights and even a perm. I love a new look every few months and I've NEVER been disappointed in Jenny's talents. Her prices are equivalent or less then other salons in the Las Cruces area. I've always been treated well and never waited more then 5-10 minutes for an appointment. Jenny has always accommodated my crazy schedule. Plus, I can make appointments via text.....hair should be easy and Jenny does just that for me!!Shear Talentprice.heathern ratedI have been to Jennifer C. for...I have been to Jennifer C. for my hair for years and everytime i go in and get my hair done I come out amazed at the talent and skill she has with hair. she has done up do's colors, highlights, lowlights, corn rows and the like to my hair and she does absolutely amazing work. I would recommend her business to anyone who wants their hair done the right way. They may take more than 20-30 minutes to get your hair done but the quality and look is well worth the wait. Now That I live in tx i havent stepped foot in a salon and i usually pay jen visits on my rare trips back to NM to freshen my look up for me.Shear Talentjessica.white.9822924 ratedI don't let anyone else touch ...I don't let anyone else touch my hair. I love the ladies at Shear Talent. They're always friendly, and Jenny always finds the time to give my unibrow a good waxing when I just pop in to say hi. Oh, speaking of, when was the last time you loved your stylist so much that you wanted to stop by and say hi every time you were in the neighborhood? They're never pretentious and always upbeat. In January I moved to Alamogordo, and while I'm sure there are plenty of talented stylists in the area, I still don't trust anyone else with my hair. I mean seriously, I let Jenny shave part of my head yesterday! Katharozchristinal756 ratedI love Katharoz! The staff is ...I love Katharoz! The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have samplers of all the makeup, so you can try different colors/things out for yourself before you buy. I had a "color match" service where they applied the proper shade of bare minerals makeup, and showed me how to apply it myself step by step. I also go here for facials and waxing. The estheticians are great, very friendly, gentle and knowledgeable.  The prices are great, not cheap but not super expensive either.  I highly recommend stopping by!Tami & Co Studio 105susanbr ratedThis was a nice surprise for m...This was a nice surprise for me.  After living in Las Cruces for 15 years, I finally found a salon and hairstylist I am happy with.I was heard for once as to what my concerns were for my hair.  I do not know exactly what Tammy used on my hair, but when I left my hair had a beautiful natural looking color and my cut was exactly what I asked for.  My hair has never felt so good!  I would recommend Tammy for your hair.  Her consultations are very different, maybe because I have never had one.  I will be back!Tami & Co Studio 105lulu.l ratedThis is one of the finest spa'...This is one of the finest spa's in town.I can't believe that this""" Christina"" person suffered  such an unbelievable experiance. Sounds "fishy" to me .Perhaps a rival vendetta. This happens in all businesses.It is unfortunate that this person did not contact MissJacquie personally.Taking the cowardly way out by posting on a website! Childish ,come forward and voice your concerns in person.Bet you don't because you don't exist!!!
