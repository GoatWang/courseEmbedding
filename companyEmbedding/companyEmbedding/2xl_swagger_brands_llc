	Features:


		Icon attack fit

		Sublimated textile chassis

		D30 impact protectors in the shoulders, elbows, and back

		Insulated, removable SatinCore vest liner

		Sublimated graphics

		Integrated flex zones

		TechMesh panels

		Pre-curved arms

		YKK zippers

Roland Sands Carson Jacket Review



How to Measure Motorcycle Jacket Size











	Roland Sands Design Carson Jacket

	All the irreverent swagger of a typical Roland Sands leather jacket with a hint of European class. Sporting a unique construction pattern with subtle yet distinct padded detailing, the Roland Sands Carson Leather Jacket accomplishes a clean-cut, classic motorcycle jacket aesthetic with a sophisticated presence. The top-grain buffalo leather of the RSD Carson Leather Jacket has been shaped with moto-minded attention to detail to perfect the riding ergonomics, employing pre-curved sleeves, relaxed collar and dropped tail section. Zippered main closure, cuffs and pockets make sure everything stays where you put it, and there is even a soft-lined electronics pocket for added security and convenience. Add CE approved armor (sold separately) to the pockets in the back, shoulders and elbows and make the Roland Sands Carson Leather Jacket your go-to everyday riding jacket.

	Features:


		Genuine, top-grain 1.0mm-1.2mm buffalo leather

		Classic riding fit with rotated, pre-curved sleeves, dropped back length, and relaxed collar opening

		Padded details throughout jacket

		Zippered pockets and cuffs

		Side adjustable waist tabs

		Satin poly lining with custom RSD numbers heat emboss

		Soft lined electronics security pocket

		Stretch mesh cargo stuff pockets

		Armor-ready shoulder, elbow and back protector pockets (armor sold separately)


Note: Color of jacket will lighten over time due to exposure to UV light.

Carson
6'2" 200lbs, athletic build. originally bought the Large since all my measurements fit exactly within the limits, but when i received it it fit too perfectly, wouldve been a perfect fashion piece if i wasnt planning on riding in it. so I then went up a size to the XL. it fits me way better. i have more room in the chest and arms.  some cons: when i bend my elbow to snap the top button it pinches uncomfortably tight in the inside of my elbow. could be because its new. The elbow pocket where the armor goes is velcro and on one side the velcro touches my arm and scratches pretty bad. didnt experience that on my first jacket.. also the pocket for the back protector uses a zipper, and ive found if i lean against something it can dig in my back.other than that this jacket feels extremely durable. thick leather, awesome quality zippers. smooth interior lining and all around looks overall. love this jacket cant wait for summer to come around!

Nice for skinny guys, too
I'm on the skinnier side at 5'10" 140lb. Tried a few other leather jackets but wasn't satisfied with the way they sat on me. I got the Carson in small/brown, and it's perfect. The color is a very nice dark brown, almost black in the shade. The arms taper nicely from the elbows to the wrists for a secure fit on the forearms and the area where the sleeves meet the gloves, while also having an ungratuitous, comfortable amount of slack in the biceps. The adjustable snaps at the waist are appreciated, again as a skinny guy. 4/5 for protection because the RSD/ForceField armor set is sold separately, but 5/5 if installed. The pockets hold the armor snugly so there is no play, and they are barely noticeable. The interior gold lining is very nice looking and comfortable, but is easily frayed at the cuffs if your gloves have male velcro exposed; I first noticed when I saw tufts of golden fabric on my gloves. Overall very, very nice product.

Roland Sands Carson Jacket Review



How to Measure Motorcycle Jacket Size











	Roland Sands Design Carson Jacket

	All the irreverent swagger of a typical Roland Sands leather jacket with a hint of European class. Sporting a unique construction pattern with subtle yet distinct padded detailing, the Roland Sands Carson Leather Jacket accomplishes a clean-cut, classic motorcycle jacket aesthetic with a sophisticated presence. The top-grain buffalo leather of the RSD Carson Leather Jacket has been shaped with moto-minded attention to detail to perfect the riding ergonomics, employing pre-curved sleeves, relaxed collar and dropped tail section. Zippered main closure, cuffs and pockets make sure everything stays where you put it, and there is even a soft-lined electronics pocket for added security and convenience. Add CE approved armor (sold separately) to the pockets in the back, shoulders and elbows and make the Roland Sands Carson Leather Jacket your go-to everyday riding jacket.

	Features:


		Genuine, top-grain 1.0mm-1.2mm buffalo leather

		Classic riding fit with rotated, pre-curved sleeves, dropped back length, and relaxed collar opening

		Padded details throughout jacket

		Zippered pockets and cuffs

		Side adjustable waist tabs

		Satin poly lining with custom RSD numbers heat emboss

		Soft lined electronics security pocket

		Stretch mesh cargo stuff pockets

		Armor-ready shoulder, elbow and back protector pockets (armor sold separately)


Note: Color of jacket will lighten over time due to exposure to UV light.

Nice for skinny guys, too
I'm on the skinnier side at 5'10" 140lb. Tried a few other leather jackets but wasn't satisfied with the way they sat on me. I got the Carson in small/brown, and it's perfect. The color is a very nice dark brown, almost black in the shade. The arms taper nicely from the elbows to the wrists for a secure fit on the forearms and the area where the sleeves meet the gloves, while also having an ungratuitous, comfortable amount of slack in the biceps. The adjustable snaps at the waist are appreciated, again as a skinny guy. 4/5 for protection because the RSD/ForceField armor set is sold separately, but 5/5 if installed. The pockets hold the armor snugly so there is no play, and they are barely noticeable. The interior gold lining is very nice looking and comfortable, but is easily frayed at the cuffs if your gloves have male velcro exposed; I first noticed when I saw tufts of golden fabric on my gloves. Overall very, very nice product.

PinkKitty and EasyRhino, new liqueur brands from an Austin-based beverage startup, supposedly boost drinkers' libidos — more so than traditional alcohol, that is.
By infusing the 70-proof spirits with certain herbs — including avena sativa, damiana and maca — company executives claim the drinks can increase sex drive.

They are the first products from 2XL Swagger Brands LLC, led by CEO and founder Robert Tushinsky. While the company hasn't recorded any sales yet, it has signed a retail distribution deal with Dallas-based Artisanal Beverage Company LLC. Tushinsky said they spent more than $200,000 on research and development before settling on a formula.




For the on-premise market, the company says on its website that downtown Austin bars including The Gatsby, Summit Rooftop Lounge and San Jac Saloon will carry the drinks. Tushinsky said he hopes to ship 5,000 12-bottle cases by the end of 2016. The bottles retail at $29.99.
2XL was founded in 2012 and has three employees, including Tushinsky. Prior to launching his beverage company, Tushinsky worked as a global distributor for PEMF Systems Inc., a medical device company, and as a material planner/buyer for World Wide Technology Inc., according to his online profile. He has also worked in public relations and marketing and as CEO of a pasta manufacturer.
The names of the liqueur brands come from Tushinsky's love of animals. He said a portion of every sale will be donated to wildlife conservation.

Will Anderson coordinates digital coverage of business news and coverages a wide variety of topics, from consumer goods to health care.
