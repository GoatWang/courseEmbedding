Page 5




Mr. Gillon Beck, the Chairman of the Issuer's board of directors, and Mr. Ami Boehm, a member of the Issuer's board of directors, each of whom are officers of FIMI IV 2007 Ltd., the managing general partner of FIMI, will each be selling (directly or indirectly) to ORIX 37,500 Shares issuable to each of them upon the exercise of stock options that are exercisable within 60 days of May 4, 2017. According to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, the options were granted to Messrs. Beck and Boehm in connection with their service as directors, have exercise prices that range between $18.56 and $38.24 per Share and expire at different periods between November 6, 2019 and November 3, 2022. Such Shares are included in the Purchased Shares set forth above.





Effective immediately upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Boehm and Mr. Beck will resign as directors of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.


The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, the resignation of the directors as contemplated above (and of an additional director), the appointment, effective as of the closing, of ORIX's designees to the Issuer's board of directors to fill the vacancies created by the resignation of Mr. Boehm, Mr. Beck and an additional director from the board of directors of the Issuer, the appointment, effective as of the closing, of a fourth person to be mutually agreed by the Issuer and ORIX to serve as a new independent director on the Issuer's expanded nine-person board of directors, and the execution of a registration rights agreement and governance agreement (as described above), both between ORIX and the Issuer.


The foregoing summary of the Stock Purchase Agreement is not exhaustive, does not contain complete descriptions of all of the parties' rights and obligations under the Stock Purchase Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is filed hereto as Exhibit 12 and incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


Item 5 of the Schedule 13D, “Interest in Securities of the Issuer” is amended and restated to read as follows:




The percentages set forth below are based on 49,693,000 Shares outstanding as of March 16, 2017, based on the Issuer's Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2017.

 



(a), (b) Bronicki Investments beneficially owns 3,526,959 Shares, representing approximately 7.10% of the outstanding Shares. Each of Lucien Bronicki and Yehudit Bronicki is a director of Bronicki Investments and shares voting and dispositive power over the Shares held by Bronicki Investments, and beneficially owns 20% of Bronicki Investments. Accordingly, they may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the Shares held by Bronicki Investments. Each of Mr. Bronicki and Ms. Bronicki disclaims beneficial ownership of all Shares held by Bronicki Investments, except to the extent of his or her 20% interest in Bronicki Investments.


 


As a result of the voting and dispositive provisions in the Voting and Undertaking Agreements, Voting Neutralization Agreements, and SHA, each described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to also beneficially own, and have shared voting power over, an additional 6,924,118 Shares which to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons are beneficially owned by FIMI on the date of this filing, resulting in total beneficial ownership by the Reporting Persons of 10,451,077 Shares, representing approximately 21.03% of the Issuer's outstanding Shares. The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of all Shares beneficially owned by FIMI.



 

Page 6




The Reporting Persons have acted in concert with FIMI in connection with the Agreements as defined and described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D. Consequently, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to constitute a "group" with FIMI for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
Neither the filing of the Schedule 13D and any amendments thereto nor any of the contents of such filings shall be deemed to constitute an admission that a group exists for purposes of Schedule 13(d) of the Exchange Act or for any other purpose, and each Reporting Person disclaims the existence of any such group.




(c)           None of the Reporting Persons have effected any transactions in the Shares in the past 60 days, except as set forth herein. 

 
(d)           Each of Yoram Bronicki, Youval Bronicki and Michal Cath, who are the children of the Lucien and Yehudit Bronicki, beneficially owns 20% of Bronicki Investments, and accordingly they may be deemed to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons. However, each of Yoram Bronicki, Youval Bronicki and Michal Cath does not have voting or dispositive power over the Shares held by Bronicki Investments, and each disclaims beneficial ownership of all such Shares, except to the extent of his or her pecuniary interest therein.


(e)           Not applicable.

("Bronicki Investments") is a company incorporated in Israel. Bronicki Investments' principal business is various business investments, including investment in the Issuer. Bronicki Investments' business address is 5 Brosh Street, Yavne 81510, Israel. The sole directors and executive officers of Bronicki Investments are Lucien Bronicki and Yehudit Bronicki who have voting control over Bronicki Investments as described in Item 5 below.       (2)  Lucien Bronicki is a citizen of the State of Israel. Mr. Bronicki is a member of various business and philanthropic boards, including the board of directors of Bronicki Investments (as one of the two directors, the other being his wife, Ms. Yehudit Bronicki). Mr. Bronicki's address is 5 Brosh Street, Yavne 81510, Israel.       (3)  Yehudit Bronicki is a citizen of the State of Israel. Ms. Bronicki is a member of various business and philanthropic board of directors, including the board of directors of Bronicki Investments (as one of the two directors, the other being her husband, Mr. Lucien Bronicki).

(e)          None of the Reporting Persons has, during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  This Amendment is being filed jointly by the Reporting Persons. The agreement among the Reporting Persons relating to the joint filing of this Amendment is attached as Exhibit 10.   Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  Item 5 of the Schedule 13D, “Interest in Securities of the Issuer” is amended and restated to read as follows:  The percentages set forth below are based on 49,634,659 Shares outstanding as of November 8, 2016, based on the Issuer's Form 10-Q/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 9, 2016.  (a), (b)    Bronicki Investments beneficially owns 3,526,959 Shares, representing approximately 7.11% of the outstanding Shares. Each of Lucien Bronicki and Yehudit Bronicki is a director of Bronicki Investments and shares voting and dispositive power over the Shares held by Bronicki Investments, and beneficially owns 20% of Bronicki Investments. Accordingly, they may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the Shares held by Bronicki Investments. Each of Mr. Bronicki and Ms. Bronicki disclaims beneficial ownership of all Shares held by Bronicki Investments, except to the extent of his or her 20% interest in Bronicki Investments.

The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of all Shares beneficially owned by FIMI.  The Reporting Persons have acted in concert with FIMI in connection with the Agreements as defined and described in Item 4. Consequently, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to constitute a "group" with FIMI for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.  Neither the filing of the Schedule 13D and any amendments thereto nor any of the contents of such filings shall be deemed to constitute an admission that a group exists for purposes of Schedule 13(d) of the Exchange Act or for any other purpose, and each Reporting Person disclaims the existence of any such group.   (c)          None of the Reporting Persons have effected any transactions in the Shares in the past 60 days, except as set forth herein.

(d)           Each of Yoram Bronicki, Youval Bronicki and Michal Cath, who are the children of the Lucien and Yehudit Bronicki, beneficially owns 20% of Bronicki Investments, and accordingly they may be deemed to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the securities beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons. However, each of Yoram Bronicki, Youval Bronicki and Michal Cath does not have voting or dispositive power over the Shares held by Bronicki Investments, and each disclaims beneficial ownership of all such Shares, except to the extent of his or her pecuniary interest therein.  (e)           Not applicable.   Item 7.  Material to be Filed as Exhibits.  Item 7 of the Schedule 13D, “Material to be Filed as Exhibits” is amended and restated to read as follows:   Exhibit 1-  Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 10, 2014, by and among the Issuer, Ormat Industries and Ormat Systems (incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 2 of the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Issuer on November 17, 2014).

Davis Polk Advises the Special Committee of Ormat in Connection with the Acquisition by ORIX of an Ownership Stake in Ormat from FIMI and Bronicki Investments




    5/4/2017

In connection with the transaction, Ormat and ORIX will enter into a strategic partnership providing Ormat with certain commercial rights to global geothermal energy projects pursued by or presented to ORIX and granting ORIX certain corporate governance and shareholder rights at Ormat.

ORIX to Acquire 22% Ownership Stake in Ormat from FIMI and Bronicki Investments and Simultaneously Enter into Strategic Partnership with Ormat




Reno, Nevada and Tokyo, Japan, May 4, 2017 – Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ORA) and ORIX Corporation (TSE: 8591; NYSE: IX) announced today that ORIX will acquire an approximately $627 million ownership stake in Ormat by purchasing approximately 11.0 million shares of Ormat common stock from FIMI ENRG Limited Partnership, FIMI ENRG, L.P. (collectively, "FIMI"), Bronicki Investments, Ltd. ("Bronicki"), and senior members of management, representing in the aggregate an approximately 22.1% ownership position in Ormat.  The per share sale price to be paid by ORIX at closing (subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including regulatory approvals) is $57, which was the prevailing market price at the time that ORIX, FIMI and Bronicki reached agreement on the commercial terms of their transaction.  The parties expect closing (including with respect to the agreements described below) to occur in the third quarter of 2017.
Under terms of a new Commercial Cooperation Agreement between the two companies, Ormat will have exclusive rights to develop, own, operate and provide equipment for ORIX geothermal energy projects in all markets outside of Japan.  In addition, Ormat will have certain rights to serve as technical partner and co-invest in ORIX geothermal energy projects in Japan.  Also, ORIX will assist Ormat in obtaining project financing for its geothermal energy projects from a variety of leading providers of renewable energy debt financing with which ORIX has relationships in Asia and around the world.
Under related agreements, ORIX will have the right to designate three persons to be appointed to an expanded nine-person Ormat board of directors and also propose a fourth person to be mutually agreed by Ormat and ORIX to serve as a new independent director on the Ormat board.  In addition, for so long as ORIX is entitled to board representation, ORIX will be subject to certain customary standstill restrictions, including an effective 25% cap on its voting rights.  ORIX will also have certain customary registration rights with respect to the shares of Ormat common stock that it will own.
A Special Committee of the Ormat board of directors was formed to evaluate and negotiate the shareholder arrangements proposed by ORIX.  The Special Committee received independent legal counsel from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.  The agreements between ORIX and Ormat were executed by Ormat following the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee and the unanimous approval by the Ormat board of directors.
"We are excited to partner with ORIX, one of the world’s leading diversified companies with operations in 36 countries, to advance the interests of both companies," commented Gillon Beck, Ormat's Chairman. "With ORIX's significant presence around the world, access to capital and strong positioning throughout Asia, we believe Ormat can enhance and accelerate its strategic growth plans in the renewable energy market. We expect this collaboration will expand the number and quality of growth opportunities that Ormat enjoys around the world, particularly in Asia." Mr. Beck added "These past years have been exciting ones characterized by continued growth and strategy execution. I would like to thank the devoted management and employees of Ormat for their relentless efforts. ORIX is joining an amazing company and I am confident that Ormat will continue to excel and reach new highs."
“We are delighted to be partnering with Ormat to support the company’s expansion in the global geothermal energy market” said Mr. Yuichi Nishigori, Head of Energy and Eco Services Business Headquarters of ORIX.  “As one of Asia’s leading investors in the renewable energy sector, and with a growing portfolio of renewable energy investments around the world, we recognize the importance of having clean, reliable, baseload power such as that which geothermal provides, and we believe that the geothermal sector has the potential to become an increasingly large component of the world’s overall energy mix.  Given Ormat’s technological leadership and increasingly global portfolio of operations, we believe the company is well positioned to help lead this expansion, and we look forward to working with the Ormat board and existing management team to facilitate the company’s future growth and value creation.”
“Following the meetings and discussions I had with ORIX’s management in the last several weeks, I am confident that this significant cooperation agreement will support our strategic plan to expand our geographical footprint as well as technological and customer base” said Isaac Angel, Ormat’s CEO. “We expect that the comprehensive capabilities and track record of Ormat together with ORIX’s commitment to expanding the scope of its geothermal and other renewable energy activities will accelerate our growth. I look forward to leading our cooperation with ORIX on future opportunities.”

Please remember there's always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities. 
			
			Before you invest in a Section 529 plan, request the plan's official statement from your Financial Solutions Advisor and read it carefully. The official statement contains more complete information, including investment objectives, charges, expenses and risks of investing in the 529 plan, which you should consider carefully before investing. You should also consider whether your home state or your beneficiary's home state offers any state tax or other benefits that are only available for investments in such state's 529 plan. Section 529 plans are not guaranteed by any state or federal agency.

1 To be eligible for favorable tax treatment afforded to any earnings portion of withdrawals from Section 529 accounts, such withdrawals must be used for "qualified higher education expenses," as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Any earnings withdrawn that are not used for such expenses are subject to federal income tax and may be subject to a 10% additional federal tax, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 
			
2 Section 529 plans are established by various states and are offered to residents of all states. Depending on the laws of the customer's home state, favorable tax treatment for investing in a Section 529 plan may be limited to investments made in a Section 529 plan offered by the customer's home state. Neither Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated nor any of its subsidiaries are tax or legal advisors. We suggest you consult your personal tax or legal advisor before making tax or legal-related investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions 




What is an IRA?


							An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) may provide either a tax-deferred or tax-free way for you to save for retirement.  There are many different types of IRAs but Roth, Traditional and Rollover IRAs are the most common.
						






How does an IRA work?


							IRAs rely on long-term, tax-deferred compounding to provide your retirement savings the opportunity to grow more quickly than in a taxable account.  When you earn interest, receive a dividend or sell an investment (such as a mutual fund) for a gain, you don't pay taxes that year on the earnings.  Instead, all taxes are deferred until you withdraw those earnings in retirement.
						






Why is an IRA important now?


							In retirement you may need as much as 100% of your current after-tax income (take-home pay) minus any amount you are saving for retirement each year.  This makes it all the more important to start saving sooner rather than later, and an IRA can help you get started.
						






What are the ways I can invest in an IRA?


							You can choose from investment products such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and ETFs, as well as bank products like CDs and money market savings.
						






What are the contribution deadlines?

You can make contributions to an IRA for a given tax year until the tax return filing deadline of the following year.






How do I convert to a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA Conversion could help grow your retirement assets federally income tax-free. To help you convert to a Merrill Edge Roth IRA, call us at 888.637.3343 for one-on-one assistance and we'll guide you every step of the way. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.






What are my options for converting a 401(k) to an IRA?

You have several choices when it comes to your old 401(k). Typically known as a rollover IRA, you can opt to transfer your money into an IRA. Another option is keeping the current 401(k) with your old employer or transfer it to a new employer plan.

Frequently Asked Questions 




SEP IRA



Do I have to contribute annually?
                                No. A SEP IRA gives you the flexibility to decide each year whether to contribute and at what rate. That could mean contributing more during profitable years and less or nothing at all during less profitable years.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SEP IRA?
                                SEP IRAs have little to no paperwork and administration and don't require filing with the IRS. Plus, a Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you get started.
                            
Is there investment research I can review? 
                                Yes. As a Merrill Edge client, you get access to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research (rated #1 by Institutional InvestorFootnote 2)-as well as research from other industry leaders-to gain investing knowledge and market
                                insights that can help inform your investment strategy.
                            




SIMPLE IRA



Is there a mandatory employer match? 
                                Yes. With a SIMPLE IRA, you must contribute either 2% of compensation for each eligible employee, regardless of participation, or a dollar-for-dollar match of employee salary deferral contributions, capped at 3% of compensation (which may be reduced to as low as 1% in any two years during a 5-year period).
                            
What if my business grows beyond 100 employees?
                                You may need to consider establishing a small business 401(k) plan when your business grows to more than 100 employees. A Small Business Financial Solutions Advisor can help you consider your options. Please note: If you decide to establish a 401(k) plan, you would stop contributions to the SIMPLE IRA plan and then start the 401(k). Participants that have been in the SIMPLE IRA plan for over two years may roll their SIMPLE IRA assets over to the new 401(k) if it allows for rollovers. Before making any decisions, you should speak with your tax and legal advisor about your situation and the requirements for terminating a plan and establishing a new one.
                            
Is it difficult to administer a SIMPLE IRA? 
                                We have many ways to make managing your retirement plan easier. Our Merrill Lynch E-Contribs for Small Business Retirement Accounts™ provides small business owners with a convenient web-based solution for making contributions to retirement plan accounts, while the Automated Investment Program provides a systematic way to invest in mutual funds on a schedule based on your needs.
                                
                                SIMPLE IRA contributions will be made through your payroll company and you will be required to send an annual notice to your employees. You do not file IRS Form 5500 as you would with a 401(k) plan.

Each choice may offer different investment options and services, fees and expenses, withdrawal options, required minimum distributions, tax treatment and provide different protection from creditors and legal judgments.
