            Artist Biography
                            by Richie Unterberger



                    
                    As producer, Richard Robinson's main credential is doing Lou Reed's first solo album, and generally aiding Reed in making the transition from ex-Velvet Underground leader to solo star. At the beginning of the 1970s, Robinson was hardly the kind of industry vet one might have assumed would qualify for work with an artist of Reed's stature. He had done records for the Flamin' Groovies and Hackamore Brick, both cultish back-to-basics bands that drew huzzahs from some rock critics, and have in retrospect been lauded by some writers as vague antecedents of new wave, as the groups ran counter to the more psychedelic and progressive trends of the day. At the time, however, they were just little-known bands and LPs. And Reed, actually, was not too famous himself, the Velvet Underground having sold few records, and their international cult having yet to develop into the monster it eventually became.                 


 
Robinson had also been involved in other media, working as a rock writer for Go magazine, and doing a radio show on New York's WNEW. With his wife (and fellow rock writer) Lisa Robinson, and Lenny Kaye, he started the music magazine Rock Scene, one of the less serious-minded rock publications of the '70s. Richard Meltzer once wrote that Lisa Robinson would throw parties for Reed with the purpose of ingratiating the Robinson couple with the singer/songwriter, and then getting him on the comeback trail as a solo artist, with Richard Robinson as producer. It was a groupie-like situation, but the benefits did run both ways. Reed was in a state of lethargy, not doing much of anything for months after leaving the Velvet Underground in 1970, and needed some motivation to rebuild his musical career as a soloist. And Richard Robinson did get to co-produce (with Reed) Reed's first album, Lou Reed, in London for RCA in 1972. The record, however, was underproduced and did not get the most out of the material, which included leftovers from the Velvet Underground era that had not made it onto the Velvets' four studio LPs, such as "Lisa Says," "I Can't Stand It," "Walk and Talk It," and "Ocean." Oddly, supporting musicians on the album included Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe of Yes, as well as veteran British session drummer Clem Cattini. For his next album, Reed let Robinson loose and worked with David Bowie, resulting in the much more successful Transformer.                 
                            

 
                    
                    The irascible Reed was not done with Robinson, however, and worked with him again on Street Hassle, one of the performer's better late-'70s albums. Robinson's most notable other production jobs were of the Flamin' Groovies' Teenage Head and David Johansen's first solo album. Richard and Lisa Robinson were active throughout the '70s as rock writers and general scenemakers in the New York rock world. As of 1999, Richard Robinson was marketing magic products and developing websites about magic and for magicians.

ROBINSON, RICHARD B., PH.D.
Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs; Professor of Pharmacology in the Center for Molecular Therapeutics

Regulation of cardiac ion channels and autonomic signaling by development and disease; gene and cell therapies for cardiac arrhythmias.
Office: Prebyterian Hospital | 7W 318
                  Telephone: 212.305.8371

Current Research
           My laboratory is concerned with elucidating the processes that control developmental regulation of cardiac ion channel expression (i.e. electrical behavior) and cardiac autonomic responsiveness (i.e. sensitivity to neurotransmitters), and using that knowledge to design gene- and cell-based therapies for cardiac disease.

We study heart cells grown alone in culture, or co-cultured with neurons or mesenchymal stem cells. We employ a range of techniques, including standard electrophysiology, whole cell voltage clamp and fluorescence microscopy with ion sensitive dyes. By studying both native cardiac channels and recombinant channels over-expressed in myocytes we explore the molecular mechanisms that control channel function within the heart cell and the impact of development and disease on these mechanisms. We also take advantage of transgenic animals in which selected signaling elements have been disrupted or altered.
            
We have identified age-dependent differences in the function and expression of several cardiac ionic channels (including INa, ICa,L and If), and also differences in autonomic signal transduction cascades (including alpha- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic) that modulate these and other ionic channels in the heart. We have further found that neurons exert a trophic influence to modify heart cell development that can account for some of the age-dependent effects on ion channel function and the cardiac cell's response to autonomic agonists. Both neurally released peptides (e.g. NPY) and more familiar neurotransmitters (e.g. norepinephrine) can serve as developmental factors. 
            
Our increasing understanding of the factors that regulate channel function within the heart cell allows us to develop genetic therapies in which selected channels are over-expressed in the in situ heart, either within the myocytes or in stem cells that then couple to the myocytes, for the purpose of regulating cardiac rhythm. Recent efforts in this regard have resulted in proof-of-concept studies creating a biological pacemaker to augment or replace current electronic pacemakers and enhancing conduction to disrupt reentrant arrhythmias associated with myocardial infarction.

What does an artist learn from 3 weeks in California?

In April 2013 New Zealand artists Richard Robinson and John Crump visited California for 3 weeks. For 4 days they were faculty members at the Plein Air Painting Convention in Monterey. The rest of the time they were lost in the landscape. 

This book is a painter’s diary - a collection of thoughts, realisations, notes, techniques and even an epiphany or two, written to inspire and enlighten any landscape painter or art lover with a thirst for adventure and practical painting know-how. Enjoy.

            Rotational smartwatch keyboard channels the rotary phone

            breaking marine heatwave powered by climate change cooks Tasmania's fisheries
          






Climate change has warmed the waters east of Tasmania at four times the speed of the global average. But the heatwave of the southern summer of 2015/2016 was something exceptional, damaging fisheries and bringing new species to the island. It's a sign of things to come, say the researchers examining these events.

What does an artist learn from 3 months in a painter’s paradise?

In 2014 New Zealand artist Richard Robinson visited the Queenstown area of New Zealand for 3 months to paint some of the most spectacular scenery on the planet. It’s a tough job, but someone’s got to do it.

This book is a painter’s diary - a collection of thoughts, realisations, notes, techniques and even an epiphany or two, written to inspire and enlighten any landscape painter or art lover with a thirst for adventure and practical painting know-how. Enjoy.
