Canine Regen ®
 
What is Canine Regen®?
Canine Regen® is a proprietary blend made of 6 natural ingredients, which have been consumed by human and animals for many years. Canine Regen® has been shown to:

Speed Recovery
Aid in cellular Regeneration
Enhance stamina
Stimulate migration of immune cells
Improve temperament of dogs
Enhance anti-inflammatory effect
Enhance healthy hair

It has been observed that in older dogs, their physical improvement is noticeable in a matter of a few days or weeks. The difference in their temperament and wellness has impressed owners who have put their companions on it.
Canine Regen® powder is enhanced through the use of a patent pending process that increases the bioelectronmagnetic factor in the phytonutrients, thereby further enhancing the overall effectiveness of the blend.
Canine Regen® is proven safe; a product safety trial on dogs between the ages of 3 and 10 years, conducted by veterinarian Dr. Charlie Timmerman, revealed no blood abnormalities or adverse effects.
Canine Regen® is proven effective; a trial on dogs also conducted by veterinarian Dr. Charlie Timmerman showed that after just two weeks on Canine Regen® there was an average increase of 96.2% in circulating primitive cells and after four weeks the average increase was 281.3%.

BioAdaptives Announces First Product to Market

Aug 04, 2014, 10:43 ET
		  		  					
						 from   BioAdaptives, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


 
 
LAS VEGAS, Aug. 4, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- BioAdaptives, Inc. (OTCBB:BDPT) announced results of the clinical trial completed on "PRIMICELL™" which resulted in the research and development of 8 new products.
PRIMICELL™ is a trademarked name of the first product BioAdaptives, Inc. will bring to market through private labeling and exclusive licensing agreements worldwide. BioAdaptives, Inc. Chairman and CEO, Barry Epling said, "During the human clinical trial, glucose, routine hematology and chemistry parameters, kidney function and liver function were measured. The results demonstrated that no negative changes were found, supporting the conclusion that PRIMICELL™ blend is safe."
Epling added, "In addition to proving the product safe, the participants who took PRIMICELL™ on average showed a 268% increase of circulating, primitive stem cells. These results, coupled with additional scientific studies on the product, have led us to begin broader research on PRIMICELL and on 8 new, unique products in the fields of anti-aging, sports recovery, weight-loss, assisting in focus, lessening atherosclerosis, as well as regenerative help for felines and canines.  These products are each in a different stage of development. Two are near completion in research and development and will be brought to market soon."
With additional studies and trials continuing both in the United States and Overseas, Epling stated, "We are very excited at the findings to date and each new study reveals new and valuable benefits, opening doors for a wider array of products that can meaningfully better the lives of both humans and animals. It is very exciting to be a part of this."
