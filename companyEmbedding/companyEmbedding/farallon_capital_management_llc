History[edit]
Tom Steyer founded Farallon in January 1986 with $15 million in seed capital.[1] Previously, Steyer worked for San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, as a risk arbitrage trader under Robert Rubin at Goldman Sachs, and in Morgan Stanley's corporate mergers and acquisitions department.[5]
Farallon made a name for itself by being one of the first firms to raise money from a university endowment.[6] In 1987, Steyer, who received his bachelor's degree from Yale, approached the university's endowment to allocate funds for Farallon to manage. The Yale endowment declined based on the fees charged by Farallon. David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, later came to an arrangement with Tom Steyer in which Farallon would initially manage an allocation of the Yale endowment for no fee.[7] After Yale's investment proved to be lucrative, many other college endowments and pensions began to invest in hedge funds.[6]
Investment strategy[edit]
Farallon pioneered absolute return investing, a model focusing on potential returns as well as risk adjusted returns.[6] Absolute return investing "treats every investment—whether a residential mortgage, a common stock, or a parcel of land—as a bond, with an implied rate of return." [5] Farallon invests in various asset classes including value investments, credit investments, merger arbitrage, real estate related investments, and direct investments in both developed and emerging markets.[8] Farallon typically holds positions anywhere from two to five years.[1]
Farallon also practices "event driven" international investing, finding distressed international companies and helping the businesses restructure. In 1999, Farallon bought a direct stake in an Argentine shoe company, which it helped stabilize to profitability as Argentina recovered from an economic crisis. And in 2002, Farallon bought control of Bank Central Asia (BCA), an Indonesian financial institution, for $531 million. At the time, many of Indonesia's banks were on the verge of collapse because of bad loans made during President Suharto's leadership and the country was seen as dangerous for foreign investment. Over the next four years, Farallon installed a new chairman and made necessary reforms. After Farallon sold its stake for a profit in 2006, many other institutional investors began to look to Indonesia for returns. In the year before Farallon's investment in Indonesia, $286 million flowed into the country as foreign direct investment. After Farallon exited, that number grew to $1 billion in 2007 and $4 billion in 2008. According to Council on Foreign Relations economics fellow Sebastian Mallaby, "Farallon's investment was a blessing for Indonesia."[1][6]
According to Institutional Investor's Alpha, Steyer considers "himself as a research-oriented fundamental investor, not a trader."[1]
In March 2010, Farallon announced plans to refocus its investing on risk arbitrage and credit wagers and lessen its equity exposure. In addition, the firm said it would disclose more information to clients to "foster a more open culture at the hedge fund."[9]
Investment vehicles[edit]
Farallon Capital Institutional Partners - for Farallon's institutional investors to invest in.[10]
Investment history[edit]
In 2007, Farallon in partnership with Simon Property Group and other hedge funds purchased Mills Corp, a real estate investment trust.[11]
Company[edit]
In 2006 it was reported that Farallon Capital was the largest hedge fund in the world in 2005.[12] Steyer named the firm after the Farallon Islands off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area.[5]
Organization[edit]
Tom Steyer and Andrew J.M. Spokes act as the firm's Co-Managing Partners. Spokes was promoted to the position in 2007. Prior to his promotion, Spokes oversaw portfolio management and strategy for Farallon exclusive subadviser Noonday Global Management.[13] Spokes opened Farallon's first international office in London in 1998.[1]
Farallon retains talent by giving enterprising professionals the opportunity to spin off and run new funds with Farallon capital. For example, Former Farallon traders started Noonday Global Management and ChinaRock Capital using Farallon money and back office support.[5]
Today, Farallon has 21 principals, 13 managing directors and 35 investment professionals who oversee the firm's day-to-day operations and management.[4]

History[edit]
Tom Steyer founded Farallon in January 1986 with $15 million in seed capital.[1] Previously, Steyer worked for San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, as a risk arbitrage trader under Robert Rubin at Goldman Sachs, and in Morgan Stanley's corporate mergers and acquisitions department.[5]
Farallon made a name for itself by being one of the first firms to raise money from a university endowment.[6] In 1987, Steyer, who received his bachelor's degree from Yale, approached the university's endowment to allocate funds for Farallon to manage. The Yale endowment declined based on the fees charged by Farallon. David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, later came to an arrangement with Tom Steyer in which Farallon would initially manage an allocation of the Yale endowment for no fee.[7] After Yale's investment proved to be lucrative, many other college endowments and pensions began to invest in hedge funds.[6]
Investment strategy[edit]
Farallon pioneered absolute return investing, a model focusing on potential returns as well as risk adjusted returns.[6] Absolute return investing "treats every investment—whether a residential mortgage, a common stock, or a parcel of land—as a bond, with an implied rate of return." [5] Farallon invests in various asset classes including value investments, credit investments, merger arbitrage, real estate related investments, and direct investments in both developed and emerging markets.[8] Farallon typically holds positions anywhere from two to five years.[1]
Farallon also practices "event driven" international investing, finding distressed international companies and helping the businesses restructure. In 1999, Farallon bought a direct stake in an Argentine shoe company, which it helped stabilize to profitability as Argentina recovered from an economic crisis. And in 2002, Farallon bought control of Bank Central Asia (BCA), an Indonesian financial institution, for $531 million. At the time, many of Indonesia's banks were on the verge of collapse because of bad loans made during President Suharto's leadership and the country was seen as dangerous for foreign investment. Over the next four years, Farallon installed a new chairman and made necessary reforms. After Farallon sold its stake for a profit in 2006, many other institutional investors began to look to Indonesia for returns. In the year before Farallon's investment in Indonesia, $286 million flowed into the country as foreign direct investment. After Farallon exited, that number grew to $1 billion in 2007 and $4 billion in 2008. According to Council on Foreign Relations economics fellow Sebastian Mallaby, "Farallon's investment was a blessing for Indonesia."[1][6]
According to Institutional Investor's Alpha, Steyer considers "himself as a research-oriented fundamental investor, not a trader."[1]
In March 2010, Farallon announced plans to refocus its investing on risk arbitrage and credit wagers and lessen its equity exposure. In addition, the firm said it would disclose more information to clients to "foster a more open culture at the hedge fund."[9]
Investment vehicles[edit]
Farallon Capital Institutional Partners - for Farallon's institutional investors to invest in.[10]
Investment history[edit]
In 2007, Farallon in partnership with Simon Property Group and other hedge funds purchased Mills Corp, a real estate investment trust.[11]
Company[edit]
In 2006 it was reported that Farallon Capital was the largest hedge fund in the world in 2005.[12] Steyer named the firm after the Farallon Islands off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area.[5]
Organization[edit]
Tom Steyer and Andrew J.M. Spokes act as the firm's Co-Managing Partners. Spokes was promoted to the position in 2007. Prior to his promotion, Spokes oversaw portfolio management and strategy for Farallon exclusive subadviser Noonday Global Management.[13] Spokes opened Farallon's first international office in London in 1998.[1]
Farallon retains talent by giving enterprising professionals the opportunity to spin off and run new funds with Farallon capital. For example, Former Farallon traders started Noonday Global Management and ChinaRock Capital using Farallon money and back office support.[5]
Today, Farallon has 21 principals, 13 managing directors and 35 investment professionals who oversee the firm's day-to-day operations and management.[4]

History[edit]
Tom Steyer founded Farallon in January 1986 with $15 million in seed capital.[1] Previously, Steyer worked for San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, as a risk arbitrage trader under Robert Rubin at Goldman Sachs, and in Morgan Stanley's corporate mergers and acquisitions department.[5]
Farallon made a name for itself by being one of the first firms to raise money from a university endowment.[6] In 1987, Steyer, who received his bachelor's degree from Yale, approached the university's endowment to allocate funds for Farallon to manage. The Yale endowment declined based on the fees charged by Farallon. David Swensen, Yale's chief investment officer, later came to an arrangement with Tom Steyer in which Farallon would initially manage an allocation of the Yale endowment for no fee.[7] After Yale's investment proved to be lucrative, many other college endowments and pensions began to invest in hedge funds.[6]
Investment strategy[edit]
Farallon pioneered absolute return investing, a model focusing on potential returns as well as risk adjusted returns.[6] Absolute return investing "treats every investment—whether a residential mortgage, a common stock, or a parcel of land—as a bond, with an implied rate of return." [5] Farallon invests in various asset classes including value investments, credit investments, merger arbitrage, real estate related investments, and direct investments in both developed and emerging markets.[8] Farallon typically holds positions anywhere from two to five years.[1]
Farallon also practices "event driven" international investing, finding distressed international companies and helping the businesses restructure. In 1999, Farallon bought a direct stake in an Argentine shoe company, which it helped stabilize to profitability as Argentina recovered from an economic crisis. And in 2002, Farallon bought control of Bank Central Asia (BCA), an Indonesian financial institution, for $531 million. At the time, many of Indonesia's banks were on the verge of collapse because of bad loans made during President Suharto's leadership and the country was seen as dangerous for foreign investment. Over the next four years, Farallon installed a new chairman and made necessary reforms. After Farallon sold its stake for a profit in 2006, many other institutional investors began to look to Indonesia for returns. In the year before Farallon's investment in Indonesia, $286 million flowed into the country as foreign direct investment. After Farallon exited, that number grew to $1 billion in 2007 and $4 billion in 2008. According to Council on Foreign Relations economics fellow Sebastian Mallaby, "Farallon's investment was a blessing for Indonesia."[1][6]
According to Institutional Investor's Alpha, Steyer considers "himself as a research-oriented fundamental investor, not a trader."[1]
In March 2010, Farallon announced plans to refocus its investing on risk arbitrage and credit wagers and lessen its equity exposure. In addition, the firm said it would disclose more information to clients to "foster a more open culture at the hedge fund."[9]
Investment vehicles[edit]
Farallon Capital Institutional Partners - for Farallon's institutional investors to invest in.[10]
Investment history[edit]
In 2007, Farallon in partnership with Simon Property Group and other hedge funds purchased Mills Corp, a real estate investment trust.[11]
Company[edit]
In 2006 it was reported that Farallon Capital was the largest hedge fund in the world in 2005.[12] Steyer named the firm after the Farallon Islands off the coast of the San Francisco Bay Area.[5]
Organization[edit]
Tom Steyer and Andrew J.M. Spokes act as the firm's Co-Managing Partners. Spokes was promoted to the position in 2007. Prior to his promotion, Spokes oversaw portfolio management and strategy for Farallon exclusive subadviser Noonday Global Management.[13] Spokes opened Farallon's first international office in London in 1998.[1]
Farallon retains talent by giving enterprising professionals the opportunity to spin off and run new funds with Farallon capital. For example, Former Farallon traders started Noonday Global Management and ChinaRock Capital using Farallon money and back office support.[5]
Today, Farallon has 21 principals, 13 managing directors and 35 investment professionals who oversee the firm's day-to-day operations and management.[4]

Core Strategies


Farallon® seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through a process of fundamental, bottom-up analysis. We pursue multiple investment strategies on an opportunistic basis, which include five core investment strategies: Credit Investments, Long/Short Equity, Merger Arbitrage, Real Estate-related Investments, and Direct Investments. Each investment is evaluated independently on a fundamental basis. Farallon invests globally, focusing on developed and emerging markets alike. We make investments in public and private debt and equity securities, and direct investments in private companies and real estate.
Farallon places a priority on the preservation of capital. While we value and employ risk management analytics, we primarily manage risk through rigorous research and analysis. We also seek to build strong relationships with the management of the companies in which we invest.

+Credit InvestmentsThis category includes investments in companies experiencing financial distress or whose credit is viewed as marginal but improving, or whose debt Farallon believes is inexpensive relative to its underlying risk, or delivers an attractive return.  Credit Investments include non-investment grade debt in leveraged or underperforming companies, as well as companies experiencing a liquidity crisis, defaulting on their debt obligations, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection (or its equivalent), undergoing liquidation or undergoing another corporate event, such as a merger, recapitalization, reorganization or restructuring. Credit Investments may also be made in anticipation of strengthening credit, a repayment or refinancing, an event of default or amendment or renegotiation of covenants or economic terms. This category comprises mainly debt securities and instruments and debt-like securities and instruments, including, without limitation, bonds and loans, including high-yield and mezzanine loans, bonds and notes; funded and unfunded bridge loans; bank loans, participations and sub-participations in such loans; accounts and note’s receivable and payable held by trade and other creditors; asset-backed securities and loans backed by loans, leases or receivables; commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and loans; credit default swaps and other types of derivatives; preferred stock and convertible securities and warrants; litigation claims; and interests in liquidating entities. Farallon may purchase existing securities or instruments on a secondary basis or may purchase newly originated securities or instruments on a primary basis.

+Long/Short EquityThis category consists of investments and short sales in securities that we believe are underpriced or overpriced relative to their intrinsic or fundamental value.  These mispricings may be caused by, among other things, general market conditions, a company-specific issue that Farallon believes is temporary, a change in management or strategic direction, or a variation between Farallon’s assessment of a company or its market and that of other market participants. This category also sometimes includes investments in restructuring companies that are undergoing significant corporate events such as spin-offs, recapitalizations, litigation events, strategic realignments and other major changes. These investments typically are made in common stock. We frequently seek to hedge our equity investments with short or long positions in individual company stocks or stock market indices or other derivative instruments.

+Merger ArbitrageOur Merger Arbitrage strategy is focused mainly on corporate takeovers. Each investment seeks to capture the spread between the current and projected values of securities of companies involved in a merger or acquisition. To employ this strategy, we typically establish a long position (usually a purchase of common stock) in an announced takeover candidate and, if the proposed merger or acquisition is structured as a share-for-share deal, take a short position in the company making the acquisition.

+Real Estate InvestmentsThis strategy pursues investments in fee simple real estate, leaseholds, mortgages, or other real estate-related assets, especially in cases where redevelopment, leasing, and addition of management expertise can add value. Farallon invests across a broad range of real estate assets, with a focus on office, retail, multifamily and industrial assets, and at various points in the capital structure of a real estate transaction. Investments typically involve the purchase of assets that we believe are undervalued or inefficiently managed or financed, in particular assets that are valued at a significant discount to replacement cost or can be transformed to higher and better uses. 

+Direct InvestmentsDirect investments in equity and debt of operating and services businesses, and any other businesses, may be made pursuant to any of the foregoing or other strategies. Such “Direct Investments” include private market transactions in which a debt, preferred stock, or equity investment is made, typically with an expectation of receiving a cash return and generally achieving additional upside if the investment performs according to expectations. For these investments, Farallon generally looks for inefficiently financed situations in which it can facilitate a recapitalization, or situations in which traditional institutional financing is not available.

Marketing Manager, Hilton Worldwide  Plunkett Research Online is an excellent resource…the database contains a wealth of useful data on sectors and companies, which is easy to search and well presented.   Help and advice on how to conduct, export and save searches is available at all stages. Penny Crossland, Editor, VIP Magazine  The more I get into the database, the happier I am that we’ll have it–REALLY happy!!!  Between the quality and affordability of your product, its appeal to and value for our users, and the inestimably ethical and loyalty-guaranteeing conduct of your business, I will always have more than sufficient praises to sing for Plunkett Research. Michael Oppenheim, Collections & Reference Services, UCLA  Plunkett Research Online provides a great ‘one stop shop’ for us to quickly come up to speed on major industries. It provides us with an overall analysis of the market, key statistics, and overviews of the major players in the industry in an online service that is fast, easy to navigate, and reliable. Wendy Stotts, Manager, Carlson Companies-Information Center  We are especially trying to push Plunkett’s since all of our students have to do so much industry research and your interface is so easy to use.
