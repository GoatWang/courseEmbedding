SCOTTSDALE, AZ -- (Marketwired) -- 06/15/17 --
 TimefireVR, Inc. (OTCQB:TFVR) (the "Company"), a Virtual Reality content developer, formally launches its exclusive Virtual Reality title Hypatia today. Hypatia is a multi-player multi-hour social environment that is available starting today for $29.99.
Founder and President John Wise states, "This is a watershed moment for TimefireVR and the efforts of a team of nearly 30 women and men as we are sharing our vision of Virtual Reality in a creative, cultural, and collaborative space. While we have put down the foundation of a world where ultimately education, commerce, and enterprise will play a significant role, this is just the beginning for us and we intend to create a much larger presence in VR in the future."
"TimefireVR has been developing Hypatia for three years, since the earliest days when Oculus was kickstarting VR back to life. In an unproven and non-existent market, Co-Founder and CEO Jeffrey Rassás along with other core investors made it possible for our team to bring Hypatia to market." 
Co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Rassás adds, "Initially Hypatia is launching on the Steam Store for the Vive VR Headsets via their online service and directly from the TimefireVR website using a link to the Humble Store. Furthermore, we are ready to support the Oculus platform months ahead of schedule as a result of the collaboration and generous support of the team at Oculus. Our Hypatia title, pending final confirmation of compatibility will be published and available on the Oculus store and HTC's Viveport."
About TimefireVR Inc.TimefireVR Inc. is an Arizona based Technology Company established mid-2014 to develop virtual reality content, tools, and services. Their first product is a massive and collaborative open world titled Hypatia, a truly social online destination featuring commerce, entertainment, and a safe and welcoming environment to explore educational opportunities.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding development of TimefireVR's products and our anticipated launch timing for Hypatia. The words "believe," "may," "estimate," "continue," "anticipate," "intend," "should," "plan," "could," "target," "potential," "is likely," "will," "expect" and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include the Company's need for capital, the future condition of the capital markets in general and the market for microcap securities, and software bugs that could delay TimefireVR's successful development of its Virtual Reality platform. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Any forward-looking statement made by us herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

About UsHome  ABOUT  About Us



TIMEFIRE VR
TimefireVR  is an Arizona based Technology Company established mid-2014 to develop virtual reality content, tools, and services. Our first product is a massive, collaborative open world titled Hypatia, a truly social online destination featuring commerce, entertainment, and a safe, welcoming environment to explore cultural and educational opportunities. Based on architectural influences ranging from Amsterdam and Barcelona to Wuzhen, China, Sana, Yemen and the remote village of Tiebele in Burkino Faso, TimefireVR’s platform will provide a rich, multi-cultural, creative and participative world where the reward is immersed in experiential learning and global friendships.
  
WHO WE ARE
We are the lucky ones, we are investing our valuable time to explore our imaginations. In there we find memories, images, stories, places we’ve visited, and adventures we are yet to have. It is from here that we build our company and the first virtual city known as Hypatia.
We cannot do this alone. We must collaborate, find and build a community and explore our creativity to accomplish this monumental task. These are the three C’s that help define our goals.
We are building Hypatia as a safe place to explore, learn, be entertained, meet with friends and family, and find delight along the way. There are no guns, no zombies, and no war. This is a place for the discovery of mind, imagination, and self.
