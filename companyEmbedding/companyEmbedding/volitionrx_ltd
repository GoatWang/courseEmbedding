VolitionRx Limited Corrects an Earlier Announcement

ISNES, Belgium, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE MKT: VNRX) today has issued corrections to certain statements made in the press release issued by the Company on May 9, 2017 regarding the Company's Nu.Q™ Colorectal Cancer Screening Triage Test. Due to the Company's administrative error, Professor Hans Jorgen Nielsen from Hvidovre Hospital, University of Copenhagen, did not have adequate opportunity to review and comment upon the release or approve his included statement prior to its publication. The Company apologizes unreservedly for this oversight and has significantly revised its data review and reporting policy to prevent similar occurrences in the future.








Triage update: in the May 9th press release, we announced results showing that 24.5% of colonoscopies could be avoided and almost 95% of colorectal cancers and 87.9% of high-risk adenomas detected. While those topline numbers are accurate, further detailed analysis carried out during the last month has shown the selected immunoassays individually had a high p-value and therefore are in the process of being replaced. This continuing analytical process is part of an ongoing evaluation of results of lab work, to discover and select the most effective immunoassays, with the aim of achieving the highest possible results.
The Company looks forward to publishing further detailed analysis of this data, as well as results from the ongoing Triage Pathway Design Study over the coming months.
About Volition
Volition is a multi-national life sciences company developing simple, easy to use blood-based cancer tests to accurately diagnose a range of cancers. The tests are based on the science of Nucleosomics®, which is the practice of identifying and measuring nucleosomes in the bloodstream or other bodily fluid -- an indication that disease is present.
As cancer screening programs become more and more widespread, our products aim to help to diagnose a range of cancers quickly, simply, accurately and cost effectively. Early diagnosis has the potential to not only prolong the life of patients, but also to improve their quality of life.
Volition's research and development activities are currently centered in Belgium, with additional offices in London, Texas and Singapore, as the company focuses on bringing its diagnostic products to market first in Europe, then in the U.S. and ultimately, worldwide.

Safe Harbor Statement
Statements in this press release may be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that concern matters that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in the forward-looking statements. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "aims," "targets," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "optimizing," "potential," "goal," "suggests," "could," "would," "should," "may," "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements relate to the effectiveness of Volition's bodily-fluid-based diagnostic tests as well as Volition's ability to develop and successfully commercialize such test platforms for early detection of cancer. Volition's actual results may differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements due to numerous risks and uncertainties. For instance, if Volition fails to develop and commercialize diagnostic products, it may be unable to execute its plan of operations. Other risks and uncertainties include Volition's failure to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals to distribute and market future products in the clinical IVD market; a failure by the marketplace to accept the products in Volition's development pipeline or any other diagnostic products Volition might develop; Volition will face fierce competition and Volition's intended products may become obsolete due to the highly competitive nature of the diagnostics market and its rapid technological change; and other risks identified in Volition's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other documents that Volition files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Volition's business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and, except as required by law, Volition does not undertake an obligation to update its forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.
Nucleosomics®, NuQ®, Nu.Q™ and HyperGenomics® and their respective logos are trademarks and/or service marks of VolitionRx Limited and its subsidiaries. All other trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this press release are the property of their respective owners.
