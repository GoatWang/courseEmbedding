Commercial:  PDA Cradle
Overview: Consulted with a Maryland software and systems engineering company  developing a covert internet tracking device for a government agency.  The    plastic overmolded cradle contained six interconnected components that held a personal digital assistant (PDA) with their custom software, mounted GPS board, RF micro antenna and suction cups for window mounting.  The RP polyurethane casting process made numerous assemblies for field use.

Consumer:  Ice Hockey Shin Guards
Overview: Consulting with a reputable sports equipment company during its initial  entry into a new sports market, a few ice hockey shin guards were created.  The injection molded hard plastic components were joined with other sewn soft materials for both knee and shin padding.  Unique flexing side panels ensured both comfort and adequate protection.  These parts required complex 3-D CAD surface modeling for a proper human factors fit.

Consumer:  Wind Resistant Umbrella
Overview: Client desired to develop an umbrella that would be resistant to high winds for beach and general outdoor patio usage.  Working with both fiberglass and carbon fiber rods in a custom designed central spinning mechanism with 16 pivoting ball and socket joints, a collapsible 8 fabric blade umbrella was successfully designed and rapid prototyped.  The complete assembly drawing package and 3-D CAD files were then prepared for production.

Commercial:  Satellite Displacement Engine Demo
Overview: The client included an inventive physicist and business development      consultants with experience licensing technologies.  Two functional        prototypes were needed that would more clearly visually demonstrate the basic physics principles behind their envisioned new satellite displacement engine.  Live action video demo tests taken on an air table at the UMD’s Physics Lab were used for an important sales presentation at ATK Thiokol.

Consumer:  Remote Door Lock
Client had the product idea for some sort of remote door lock externally operated by a key fob for additional home security.  The final design used a high torque gearmotor to rotate a wedged rubber foot up and down onto the floor.  Custom control board, initially external for demo purposes, was powered via batteries or AC-DC wall plug.  The plastic clamshell enclosure was easily slide mounted to a bracket on the leading lower door corner.

Plastic Rapid Prototypes
Overview: Today many new products are comprised of plastic components as part of a larger complete assembly.  Various types of rapid prototype (RP) services are available to 3-D print or polyurethane cast from soft tooling in order to best determine proper Form , Fit and Function (FFF) prior to investing in the more expensive production injection mold tooling.  Examples of individual plastic parts and assemblies fabricated by RP processes are shown here.
