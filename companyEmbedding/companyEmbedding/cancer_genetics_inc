Genetics






What is genetics?
Cancer is triggered by mutations (changes) in the genes of a cell. These changes cause cells to reproduce in an unstructured, abnormal way. Most cancers occur by chance or sporadically. Gene changes may result from a random mistake when cells are dividing. Genes may also change in response to lifestyle habits and/or environment exposures or injuries.
A small portion of cancers have been identified as resulting from genetic changes that are inherited. Individuals with an inherited gene mutation tendency have an increased risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. However, not everyone who is born with a tendency for a gene mutation will develop cancer.
At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA) we offer genetic testing to help determine if your cancer was due to an inherited gene mutation and if you are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer. 
Our Cancer Genetics Program consists of genetics education, counseling and testing services. You will learn about the role of genes and hereditary in the development of cancer and which of your family members may be affected. Before and after your test, you will meet with a genetic counselor to discuss your questions and concerns.
What is genomic tumor assessment?
CTCA also offers genomic tumor assessment to help uncover genetic changes occurring within the tumor itself. Identifying these changes may help determine what’s driving the growth of cancer. With this information, our physicians can better understand what’s driving the growth of the cancer and find treatment options not previously considered.
The terms genetics and genomics may seem similar. Both refer to the genes in an individual. But genetics looks only at the traits you inherited from your parents, while genomics is focused exclusively on what’s happening to the genes of an individual tumor.
Watch our video above to learn more about the difference.

No two patients, and no two cancers, are alike. Each deserves a personalized, comprehensive approach.









Your cancer isn’t like anyone else’s—and your treatment shouldn't be, either. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), our cancer experts use state-of-the-art technologies to treat cancer. At the same time, we help you manage cancer-related side effects like pain, nausea, neuropathy and fatigue, to help you maintain the strength and stamina to continue treatment and get back to life.
Learn about our integrative care model





Because our cancer experts treat only cancer, they are familiar with our patients' unique needs and trained on the wide array of treatments and therapies available. Each patient is assigned a multidisciplinary care team of doctors and clinicians who answer your questions, review your health history, and provide you and your family with clear information, so you can make informed decisions about your treatment.
Meet our team of experts 





At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), genomic medicine plays a prominent role in our commitment to delivering innovative, personalized treatments to our patients. The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) clinical trial offers an important new approach. The TAPUR study is a clinical trial that aims to improve our understanding of how commercially available anti-cancer drugs perform on a broader range of cancers, by matching the drugs to tumors with specific genomic mutations that the drugs are designed to target.

Early Twitter Vets Launch Color Genomics To Make Genetic Screenings For Breast Cancer Affordable

Next Story

It’s Too Soon To Judge Satya Nadella












I’m always excited when an experienced team from the consumer mobile world crosses over into a complex and formidable area like healthcare or biotech. With Color Genomics, we’re getting just that.
Elad Gil and Othman Laraki, who sold Mixer Labs to Twitter six years ago and went on to oversee search, geo and growth for the company, have joined forces again to do affordable genetic screenings for women.
They’re focusing on the two BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Although mutations on these two genes only happen in 1 to 2 percent of the population, they’re heavily associated with breast cancer. If you have a mutation in BRCA1, you have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer.
So Laraki and Gil’s new company, Color Genomics, focuses on bringing the costs of screenings down to $249.
“For every one woman that our competitors can test, we can test 10 women for the same price,” Gil said. Competitor Myriad Genetics, which famously lost a case at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 over whether it had a patent on the BRCA genes and thereby a monopoly on testing around them, charges roughly $4,000.
The Color Test is a clinical­-grade, comprehensive genetic sequencing test that covers 19 major genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer. The tests have to be ordered through a physician — either through the patient’s doctor or one inside of Color’s network.
All test results come paired with a genetic counseling session at no extra charge. Making sense of these genetic screenings can be an emotionally fraught and complex process. If a woman, for instance, is a carrier, she may have to make tough medical choices around prophylactic surgery. Angelina Jolie, a BRCA1 mutation carrier who lost her mother to breast cancer, famously wrote a New York Times op-ed two years ago about her choice to have a preventative double mastectomy.
What qualifies Gil and Laraki to cross over into bioinformatics?
Gil, who you might know from his (very) good blog as an angel investor and serial entrepreneur, actually has a Ph.D. in genetics. He did graduate research on cancer and functional genomics at MIT before going into the consumer web at Google and then at Twitter. Laraki also has a personal interest, given that he’s a BRCA2 mutation carrier.
Taylor Sittler, another co-founder, was recently a pathology resident at UCSF who has been working on algorithms for more accurate cancer screenings. The last co-founder, Nish Bhat, was a security engineer at Lookout. They’ve brought on Mary ­Claire King, the scientist credited with discovering the BRCA1 gene, as an adviser, too.
Using the mixed genetics and computer science background of their 25-person team, Gil and Laraki have focused on getting the screening costs down.
“The question for us is how can you use a combination of software, lab automation and an understanding of biology to drive down the cost dramatically?” Gil said.
This involves making custom machinery and new types of software analysis to make sense of all of the data that these tests produce. Another Bay Area bioinformatics company that’s valued at more than $1 billion privately called Counsyl has taken a similar tack, by even custom-making their own robotics arms to handle large tray samples. They do BRCA screenings too, although their major focus is on carrier screening, which helps prospective parents learn if they are at risk of passing on any recessive gene disorders to their potential offspring. All of these companies are part of a wave of new startups that marry computer science with biology amid a dramatic decline in the cost of genetic sequencing.
With the launch, Color has attracted a whole host of funding from prominent female investors including Eventbrite’s Julia Hartz, Twitter’s Katie Stanton and alum Chloe Sladden, Laurene Powell Jobs, Blackrock founding partner Sue Wagner, Google board member Ann Mather and Minted CEO Miriam Naficy. Khosla Ventures and Formation 8 are the major venture firms in the $15 million round.
They’re also finding ways to make it free to lower-income communities with an Every Woman Program, that will delivery free testing through UCSF and the University of Washington. Every person who purchases a test can donate money to support another woman who cannot afford it.
“Our broad goal is to democratize access to genetic testing,” Laraki said. “I’ve had two grandparents pass away from this disease, so for me, the focus on cancer was very natural.”

Why OneOme’s RightMed® test?

Over 4 billion prescriptions are issued each year.1 However, not all drugs are effective for all people. In fact, response rates for many drugs are only between 50-75%.2 Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) account for up to 7% of all hospital admissions and up to 20% of re-admissions, according to estimates.3,4 ADRs are the fourth leading cause of death and are estimated to cost $136 billion annually.5 An estimated 10-20% of ADRs may be due to genetic factors.6
Healthcare providers like you may use pharmacogenomic information to make better prescription decisions.  
The OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test includes 22 actionable genes that cover more than 340 of the most commonly used drugs drugs across ONCOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, and 28 OTHER DISEASE AREAS.

Our solution
Pharmacogenomics — effectively integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care.







The OneOme RightMed® pharmacogenomic test

The OneOme RightMed test is a physician-ordered pharmacogenomic test that analyzes a patient’s DNA to determine how he or she may respond to certain medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of a static and interactive report which clearly identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.

PROVIDER TOOLKIT PATIENT TOOLKIT






How people metabolize drugs 


Poor metabolizer (PM)
Metabolizes drugs much
more slowly than normal.  

Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
Metabolizes more
slowly than normal.  

Normal metabolizer (NM)
Metabolizes at a
normal rate.  

Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)
Metabolizes more
quickly than normal.  


Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genes affect his or her response to medications, examines metabolization as a major factor contributing to an individual's response to drugs. Knowing how a patient will metabolize, or break down, many drugs will help physicians determine which drugs may work for their patients and reduce the trial-and-error approach.  
Depending on variations in a patient’s genes, that patient may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly. If the patient is a poor metabolizer of a given drug, he or she may be exposed to too much of it, which may result in an adverse drug reaction (ADR). If the patient is an ultrarapid metabolizer of a drug, he or she may not get enough to have any effect at all. Since genes don’t change with time, this patient will always be an ultrarapid metabolizer of that drug.  
Physicians can use this information to determine optimal drugs and doses for their patients.






Co-developed by Mayo Clinic, the RightMed test is:


COMPREHENSIVE: Rigorous, proprietary analysis that covers 22 GENES, 340+ COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, and 28 CONDITIONS


INDIVIDUALIZED: Comprised of a patient’s genetic information, medication history, and drug-to-drug interactions


CREDIBLE: Co-developed and exclusively licensed with Mayo Clinic; characterized by SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA


ACTIONABLE: Provides enhanced static reports and interactive decision support tools for easy readability and quick decision-making within the provider workflow


ACCESSIBLE: Affordable — offered at a low-cost, out-of-pocket expense.


CONVENIENT: Customized 24/7 logistics and customer support including expert medical, genetics, and pharmacology staff on call
  


for providers for pharmacists for patients






Testing for today and tomorrow 
OneOme brings clarity and insight into new and existing medications. OneOme’s RightMed PGx test may help with:


CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS (REACTIVELY): Physicians can get insight into why a patient might be experiencing adverse effects or is not experiencing the expected benefits from a drug they’re already taking


PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS (PROACTIVELY): Before prescribing a new medication, physicians can leverage a patient’s PGx profile to make more informed decisions



Because DNA does not change with time, the OneOme RightMed PGx test may provide years of more accurate decision-making.







 OneOme's process 

OneOme’s RightMed pharmacogenomic test analyzes a patient’s genetic information through our curated clinical PGx knowledgebase to provide information on the individual patient’s PGx profile. The actionable results are delivered to the provider through a variety of decision support tools.

A simple cheek swab can save your life



 

The challenge is that patients aren’t getting access to personalized treatment options.  We help cancer patients and their health care providers identify genetic testing that could play a role in personalizing cancer treatment plans. Our board certified genetic counselors fill this gap by recommending genetic tests that profile a patient’s cancer and identify relevant genetic markers. The test results are analyzed to help identify if there are treatments or clinical trials that could personalize a patient’s cancer treatment plan. BioGeneticsRx is a telemedicine clinic which allows us to support patients and healthcare providers by Phone and Online Video conferencing from home.


BioGeneticsRx Cancer DNA Tests screen a number of known genes related to hereditary cancers. The goal of every test is to determine a patient's risk of cancer. This knowledge can help your physician to develop the appropriate of preventative treatment plan for early detection.  If the results of your test indicate an increased risk for cancer, your doctor my order tests like mammograms, colonoscopy, and CT scans for any possible diagnosis and immediate intervention.

Hereditary Cancer Screening
Cancer genomics testing analyzes mutations in a patient’s DNA known to be associated with an increased risk of hereditary cancer. Our laboratory provides a comprehensive report indicating a patient’s potential susceptibility to various hereditary cancers. This testing uses the latest next generation sequencing technology to analyze patient samples in a rapid and accurate fashion. This information helps guide a clinician’s route of personalized therapy dependent on the specific genomic mutation and associated cancer.

Paving the Way to Personalized Treatment
Cancer Genetics has developed a number of proprietary tests for difficult-to-diagnose cancers including B-cell neoplasms, urogenital cancers, and HPV-associated cancers. Proprietary test platforms include NGS-based panels, CGH microarrays, and DNA-FISH probes. CGI also offers unique pharmacogenomic testing.

Next-Generation Sequencing
Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) performs massively parallel sequencing of genomes, allowing for the analysis of a significant number of genomic targets with a single test. Critically, NGS allows for the detection of aberrations that may only be present at very low levels, but which may have important clinical relevance for the patient’s diagnosis and prognosis.
Click here to learn more about CGI’s proprietary Focus::NGS®panels.
DNA-FISH Probes
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to detect chromosomal aberrations such as DNA copy number changes (gain/loss) and rearrangements (translocation/break apart). FISH is a method of choice for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction for a number of hematological and solid tumor cancers.
Click here to learn more about FHACT,® CGI’s FISH-based HPV-Associated Cancer Test.
CGH Microarrays
Microarray based technology assesses a large number of genetic alterations in a single experiment. One application of this technology, known as array-CGH, is utilized to evaluate DNA copy number changes (gains/losses) observed frequently in tumor genomes. CGI has designed disease-specific, targeted microarrays for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in a variety of cancers.
Click here to learn more about MatBA,® CGI’s Array-CGH assay for mature B-cell neoplasms.
Pharmacogenomic Testing
Pharmacogenomic testing is becoming increasingly central to the field of personalized medicine. Pharmacogenomic testing assesses biomarkers associated with drug metabolism and is used to help reduce the incidence of adverse drug reactions and predict how an individual patient will respond to a given medication. Pharmacogenomics can help ensure that patients get the right medication and the right dose.

                    Thursday, July 27, 2017 11:01 AM  UTC

RUTHERFORD, N.J. and LOS ANGELES, July  27, 2017   -- Cancer Genetics, Inc. (Nasdaq:CGIX) (“CGI” or “The Company”), a leader in enabling precision medicine for oncology through molecular markers and diagnostics, announced today that it received the 2017 North American Frost & Sullivan Award for Precision Oncology Technology Innovation. Cancer Genetics is a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of unique genomic and biomarker tests that accelerate drug development and clinical trials while also enabling precision oncology in the clinical setting. Frost & Sullivan believes CGI’s global infrastructure, which has been developed through strategic acquisitions, and its unique business model, which incorporates state-of-the-art clinical testing for cancer patients and comprehensive solutions for the biopharma community, have positioned the Company uniquely for diversified growth and access to the oncology community.
Frost & Sullivan’s Best Practices Awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis, and extensive secondary research to identify best practices in the industry. “Our business requires that we balance innovation and execution to meet the dual-edged demands of an increasingly competitive and global environment where high quality and insightful tests are required to make a real impact in oncology care. All of us at CGI are very proud to earn this prestigious award as the leader in technology innovation for precision oncology based on a combination of business model and technology factors. This demonstrates that our team’s focus on impacting patient outcomes in cancer and collaborating with others in the oncology ecosystem produce innovation that is being recognized not only by our customers and clients, but also by leading industry analysts,” stated CGI President and CEO Panna Sharma. “CGI has a wide variety of assays for genomic and immuno-oncology related biomarkers, applicable across several therapeutic areas, including hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and hereditary cancers,” said Frost & Sullivan Research Analyst Vandana Iyer. “The Company offers a broad range of laboratory services that provide critical genomic and biomarker information for patient care and for clinical trials being performed by biotech and pharmaceutical companies. CGI's recent launches of cutting edge tests, its ability to partner with innovative companies, and its extensive research collaborations with leading academic institutions and cancer centers are a testament to the value and depth of CGI’s commitment to driving industry innovation.” “CGI is a technology-agnostic company with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities utilizing various platforms,” noted Iyer. “CGI has several ongoing research collaborations with leading oncologists and cancer centers in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, including kidney cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and HPV-associated cancers. The Company constantly strives for diversity and innovation, and has successfully achieved a balance between the two.”   A summary of the report from Frost & Sullivan can be accessed from this link.

Genetics






What is genetics?
Cancer is triggered by mutations (changes) in the genes of a cell. These changes cause cells to reproduce in an unstructured, abnormal way. Most cancers occur by chance or sporadically. Gene changes may result from a random mistake when cells are dividing. Genes may also change in response to lifestyle habits and/or environment exposures or injuries.
A small portion of cancers have been identified as resulting from genetic changes that are inherited. Individuals with an inherited gene mutation tendency have an increased risk of developing cancer in their lifetime. However, not everyone who is born with a tendency for a gene mutation will develop cancer.
At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA) we offer genetic testing to help determine if your cancer was due to an inherited gene mutation and if you are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer. 
Our Cancer Genetics Program consists of genetics education, counseling and testing services. You will learn about the role of genes and hereditary in the development of cancer and which of your family members may be affected. Before and after your test, you will meet with a genetic counselor to discuss your questions and concerns.
What is genomic tumor assessment?
CTCA also offers genomic tumor assessment to help uncover genetic changes occurring within the tumor itself. Identifying these changes may help determine what’s driving the growth of cancer. With this information, our physicians can better understand what’s driving the growth of the cancer and find treatment options not previously considered.
The terms genetics and genomics may seem similar. Both refer to the genes in an individual. But genetics looks only at the traits you inherited from your parents, while genomics is focused exclusively on what’s happening to the genes of an individual tumor.
Watch our video above to learn more about the difference.

Meet our team of experts 





At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), genomic medicine plays a prominent role in our commitment to delivering innovative, personalized treatments to our patients. The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) clinical trial offers an important new approach. The TAPUR study is a clinical trial that aims to improve our understanding of how commercially available anti-cancer drugs perform on a broader range of cancers, by matching the drugs to tumors with specific genomic mutations that the drugs are designed to target.

Early Twitter Vets Launch Color Genomics To Make Genetic Screenings For Breast Cancer Affordable

Next Story

It’s Too Soon To Judge Satya Nadella












I’m always excited when an experienced team from the consumer mobile world crosses over into a complex and formidable area like healthcare or biotech. With Color Genomics, we’re getting just that.
Elad Gil and Othman Laraki, who sold Mixer Labs to Twitter six years ago and went on to oversee search, geo and growth for the company, have joined forces again to do affordable genetic screenings for women.
They’re focusing on the two BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Although mutations on these two genes only happen in 1 to 2 percent of the population, they’re heavily associated with breast cancer. If you have a mutation in BRCA1, you have a lifetime risk of up to 80 percent for developing breast cancer and up to a 50 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer.
So Laraki and Gil’s new company, Color Genomics, focuses on bringing the costs of screenings down to $249.
“For every one woman that our competitors can test, we can test 10 women for the same price,” Gil said. Competitor Myriad Genetics, which famously lost a case at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 over whether it had a patent on the BRCA genes and thereby a monopoly on testing around them, charges roughly $4,000.
The Color Test is a clinical­-grade, comprehensive genetic sequencing test that covers 19 major genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer. The tests have to be ordered through a physician — either through the patient’s doctor or one inside of Color’s network.
All test results come paired with a genetic counseling session at no extra charge. Making sense of these genetic screenings can be an emotionally fraught and complex process. If a woman, for instance, is a carrier, she may have to make tough medical choices around prophylactic surgery. Angelina Jolie, a BRCA1 mutation carrier who lost her mother to breast cancer, famously wrote a New York Times op-ed two years ago about her choice to have a preventative double mastectomy.
What qualifies Gil and Laraki to cross over into bioinformatics?
Gil, who you might know from his (very) good blog as an angel investor and serial entrepreneur, actually has a Ph.D. in genetics. He did graduate research on cancer and functional genomics at MIT before going into the consumer web at Google and then at Twitter. Laraki also has a personal interest, given that he’s a BRCA2 mutation carrier.
Taylor Sittler, another co-founder, was recently a pathology resident at UCSF who has been working on algorithms for more accurate cancer screenings. The last co-founder, Nish Bhat, was a security engineer at Lookout. They’ve brought on Mary ­Claire King, the scientist credited with discovering the BRCA1 gene, as an adviser, too.
Using the mixed genetics and computer science background of their 25-person team, Gil and Laraki have focused on getting the screening costs down.
“The question for us is how can you use a combination of software, lab automation and an understanding of biology to drive down the cost dramatically?” Gil said.
This involves making custom machinery and new types of software analysis to make sense of all of the data that these tests produce. Another Bay Area bioinformatics company that’s valued at more than $1 billion privately called Counsyl has taken a similar tack, by even custom-making their own robotics arms to handle large tray samples. They do BRCA screenings too, although their major focus is on carrier screening, which helps prospective parents learn if they are at risk of passing on any recessive gene disorders to their potential offspring. All of these companies are part of a wave of new startups that marry computer science with biology amid a dramatic decline in the cost of genetic sequencing.
With the launch, Color has attracted a whole host of funding from prominent female investors including Eventbrite’s Julia Hartz, Twitter’s Katie Stanton and alum Chloe Sladden, Laurene Powell Jobs, Blackrock founding partner Sue Wagner, Google board member Ann Mather and Minted CEO Miriam Naficy. Khosla Ventures and Formation 8 are the major venture firms in the $15 million round.
They’re also finding ways to make it free to lower-income communities with an Every Woman Program, that will delivery free testing through UCSF and the University of Washington. Every person who purchases a test can donate money to support another woman who cannot afford it.
“Our broad goal is to democratize access to genetic testing,” Laraki said. “I’ve had two grandparents pass away from this disease, so for me, the focus on cancer was very natural.”

access the power of pharmacogenomics. Today, patients at Ridgeview can receive
personalized prescription insights that previously were inaccessible to them. Not only
will our patients see better health outcomes – they are also avoiding life-threatening
adverse drug reactions, which are the fourth leading cause of death.”

Why OneOme’s RightMed® test?

Over 4 billion prescriptions are issued each year.1 However, not all drugs are effective for all people. In fact, response rates for many drugs are only between 50-75%.2 Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) account for up to 7% of all hospital admissions and up to 20% of re-admissions, according to estimates.3,4 ADRs are the fourth leading cause of death and are estimated to cost $136 billion annually.5 An estimated 10-20% of ADRs may be due to genetic factors.6
Healthcare providers like you may use pharmacogenomic information to make better prescription decisions.  
The OneOme RightMed pharmacogenomic test includes 22 actionable genes that cover more than 340 of the most commonly used drugs drugs across ONCOLOGY, PSYCHIATRY, and 28 OTHER DISEASE AREAS.

How your genes impact your
response to medications
 
Your genetic makeup can have a major influence on how you process drugs. In fact, genetic factors can account for up to 95% of how you respond to medications.1 
Depending on your genes, your body may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly, which may result in potential side effects, or no effect at all.  
Getting a pharmacogenomic test may help your physician identify effective medications for you.

Our solution
Pharmacogenomics — effectively integrated into patients’ everyday clinical care.







The OneOme RightMed® pharmacogenomic test

The OneOme RightMed test is a physician-ordered pharmacogenomic test that analyzes a patient’s DNA to determine how he or she may respond to certain medications. The analysis is provided to the physician in the form of a static and interactive report which clearly identifies which prescription drugs are — or aren’t — likely to work. This information can help providers make better prescription decisions, protect patients from adverse drug reactions and drug ineffectiveness, and reduce healthcare costs.

PROVIDER TOOLKIT PATIENT TOOLKIT






How people metabolize drugs 


Poor metabolizer (PM)
Metabolizes drugs much
more slowly than normal.  

Intermediate metabolizer (IM)
Metabolizes more
slowly than normal.  

Normal metabolizer (NM)
Metabolizes at a
normal rate.  

Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM)
Metabolizes more
quickly than normal.  


Pharmacogenomics, the study of how an individual's genes affect his or her response to medications, examines metabolization as a major factor contributing to an individual's response to drugs. Knowing how a patient will metabolize, or break down, many drugs will help physicians determine which drugs may work for their patients and reduce the trial-and-error approach.  
Depending on variations in a patient’s genes, that patient may break down a drug too slowly or too quickly. If the patient is a poor metabolizer of a given drug, he or she may be exposed to too much of it, which may result in an adverse drug reaction (ADR). If the patient is an ultrarapid metabolizer of a drug, he or she may not get enough to have any effect at all. Since genes don’t change with time, this patient will always be an ultrarapid metabolizer of that drug.  
Physicians can use this information to determine optimal drugs and doses for their patients.






Co-developed by Mayo Clinic, the RightMed test is:


COMPREHENSIVE: Rigorous, proprietary analysis that covers 22 GENES, 340+ COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS, and 28 CONDITIONS


INDIVIDUALIZED: Comprised of a patient’s genetic information, medication history, and drug-to-drug interactions


CREDIBLE: Co-developed and exclusively licensed with Mayo Clinic; characterized by SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL DATA


ACTIONABLE: Provides enhanced static reports and interactive decision support tools for easy readability and quick decision-making within the provider workflow


ACCESSIBLE: Affordable — offered at a low-cost, out-of-pocket expense.


CONVENIENT: Customized 24/7 logistics and customer support including expert medical, genetics, and pharmacology staff on call
  


for providers for pharmacists for patients






Testing for today and tomorrow 
OneOme brings clarity and insight into new and existing medications. OneOme’s RightMed PGx test may help with:


CURRENT PRESCRIPTIONS (REACTIVELY): Physicians can get insight into why a patient might be experiencing adverse effects or is not experiencing the expected benefits from a drug they’re already taking


PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS (PROACTIVELY): Before prescribing a new medication, physicians can leverage a patient’s PGx profile to make more informed decisions



Because DNA does not change with time, the OneOme RightMed PGx test may provide years of more accurate decision-making.







 OneOme's process 

OneOme’s RightMed pharmacogenomic test analyzes a patient’s genetic information through our curated clinical PGx knowledgebase to provide information on the individual patient’s PGx profile. The actionable results are delivered to the provider through a variety of decision support tools.

Helping optimize patient care.







Put pharmacogenomics to work
Pharmacists are uniquely qualified to help patients and healthcare teams utilize pharmacogenomics (PGx) by introducing and providing the OneOme RightMed® test. Covering 340+ DRUGS and 28 MEDICAL CONDITIONS, the test can help pharmacists guide optimal drug selection and dosing, much like recommending a dosing adjustment based on drug interaction or renal dysfunction. Pharmacists’ distinct education, skills, and expanding role in healthcare position them to champion processes for pharmacogenomic testing and interpretation of results – and with it, a new level of care.
Drug list sample report







Era of personalized medicine 
Trial-and-error as a prescription method can cause adverse drug reactions or inadequate patient response. This often can lead to therapeutic failures before the right drug and dosage are found.  
The approach to care is changing. Pharmacists are optimizing the paradigm of patient care by incorporating genomics into clinical decision making. This proactive approach advances pharmacy by improving patient care and personalizing drug therapies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
