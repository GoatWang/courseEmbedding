The Art of ConsistencyTM










Wealth Management





Building Wealth for Generations 

					SBH offers a clear path to designing a personalized investment plan, starting with a thorough understanding of the client’s current situation and future aspirations for themselves and their families. On that path, we view challenges as opportunities to optimize strategies and help clients make the most of their assets.				










Overview


We believe that portfolios should be as unique as the individual clients who own them. SBH has a very distinctive approach to investing clients’ money, one that is driven by research and that focuses on owning individual securities. We invest individual portfolios with care and maintain a deep understanding of both the efforts that went into building wealth and the promises that those assets hold for a client’s family, business and legacy. We take our fiduciary responsibility to each client very seriously and place our clients’ needs first. Our fees are based on the value of the assets we manage, so our goals are aligned with our clients.
Personal communication is integral to our strategy. Our highly accessible portfolio managers have a direct relationship with our clients and provide customized portfolios tailored to each client’s particular needs and goals. Our team’s continuity and comprehensive approach facilitate intergenerational coordination – we work with tax, estate and other financial advisors. We go beyond managing your wealth and help you plan for your current needs, as well as your future.


Client Process


SBH builds intelligently constructed portfolios for private clients using a mix of individual stocks, bonds and alternative investments. Each client’s asset allocation is determined by their specific goals and unique circumstances, including their investment objectives, time horizon, risk profile and income needs. Clients work directly, and communicate regularly, with a dedicated portfolio manager to build a portfolio personalized to individual needs.
SBH has a strong commitment to a time-tested investment process, driven by our in-depth, proprietary research. Our process has been vetted and approved by several institutional consultants and benefits professionals, who employ rigorous due diligence and performance measurement.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Graco (NYSE:GGG) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.75)Consensus Price Target: $101.00 (6.43% downside)
