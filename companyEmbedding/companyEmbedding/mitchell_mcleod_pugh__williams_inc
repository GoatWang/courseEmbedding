Wealth Management



We will earn your trust and confidence

We believe wealth management involves more than just investments. In fact, it’s a comprehensive approach to every aspect of our clients’ finances. But it’s also a very personal process—one that requires a high level of trust and a great deal of communication.			Rick MitchellManaging Director



Our ultimate responsibility as an investment adviser and fiduciary is to help our clients achieve their long-term investment and financial objectives. Establishing those objectives is often a difficult first step, but by working closely with our clients, we are able to formulate and implement a strategy designed to accomplish their goals.
As an independent, employee-owned investment advisory firm, we are solely devoted to the best interests of our clients. We have no affiliation with a broker or financial institution—an independence that allows us to invest on our clients’ behalf in an unbiased and transparent way, eliminating the use of potentially conflicting proprietary funds or products.
Many people pay far too much to have their money managed, often doing so without even knowing how much they are being charged. For this reason, another cornerstone of our approach to wealth management is a commitment to keeping fees and costs both low and transparent.
We take a holistic approach to wealth management, collaborating and regularly communicating not only with our clients and their families, but also with their accountants, attorneys and other financial professionals. This coordination helps us do our jobs better and allows us to simplify complex financial matters for our clients and their families.
In the end, we believe that wealth is maintained and grown by following a measured, consistent and long-term approach to investing. This philosophy may not be flashy and might conjure up images of a bygone era, but it is this very discipline that has allowed Mitchell McLeod Pugh & Williams to earn the trust of our clients and to establish ourselves as one of the largest investment advisory firms on the Gulf Coast.

Frequently Asked Questions



If your question isn’t answered below, please contact us







Is MMPW a Registered Investment Adviser?


Yes. MMPW is an employee-owned investment advisory firm registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Although registration of an investment adviser does not imply any level of skill or training, a registered advisory firm is bound by law to act in a fiduciary capacity with each client.




What type of clients do you represent?


Our clients include individuals, families, 401(k) plans, pension and profit-sharing plans, IRA rollovers, trusts, estates, and foundations. In addition, we serve as investment adviser, consultant and fiduciary to 401(k), pension and profit-sharing plans. 




How are client relationships formalized?


Both the client and MMPW sign an investment management agreement which details our duties, responsibilities and obligations in general terms and in accordance with regulatory considerations. The contract may be terminated by either party upon written notice.




What services are included in wealth management?


In addition to managing clients’ investments, we also work with their other professional advisers and family members to coordinate additional aspects of their financial affairs. This coordination includes such matters as tax planning, retirement planning, estate planning, life insurance planning, college savings and charitable giving.




What services are included in retirement plan consulting?


Beyond selecting and monitoring a retirement plan’s investment options, MMPW serves as the plan fiduciary under ERISA Section 3(38). We also coordinate the plan’s administrative functions, provide participant education and offer an annual investment review for the plan sponsor.




How often do you meet with each client? Will I receive statements?


We will meet with clients as often as requested, not only to discuss the status and performance of the portfolio, but also to review the client’s overall financial situation and the possibility of a change in investment objectives. Clients will also receive quarterly statements providing a detailed summary of the assets in the account and an overview of investment performance. Other reports include a year-end capital gains and loss report and a year-end summary of the portfolio’s income and expenses.




Does MMPW use proprietary mutual funds in the portfolios under its investment management?


No. We do not serve as investment adviser to any mutual fund and, therefore, do not receive investment advisory fees from any mutual fund. Further, we do not receive any 12b-1 fees from mutual funds, nor do we receive any fees from revenue sharing arrangements. Mutual funds used in the investment management of our clients’ portfolios are selected strictly on their investment merits.




How does MMPW select the mutual funds used in client portfolios?


We are committed to an open architecture approach. Because we have no affiliation with a broker or financial institution, MMPW is free from using any proprietary funds. Our selection process is systematic and unbiased with the primary goal of selecting the best possible funds for client portfolios. From a universe of more than 25,000 mutual funds, we screen by classification and analyze each fund using specific investment criteria.  




Will you hold my assets? Are you also my custodian? 


MMPW serves as an investment adviser only. We never serve as custodian and therefore do not hold client assets. A third-party custodian is required, creating a dual level of responsibility and accountability for our clients. This allows for the separation of investment advisory services from the possession and control of client assets.




How is your firm compensated? Do you charge commissions?


We are a fee-only advisory firm and do not charge commissions. Our investment management fees are charged according to a published fee schedule based on the assets under management or as a flat fee, subject to negotiation. MMPW does not receive any compensation or benefit from the financial products utilized to manage clients’ accounts or from the trading of assets in our clients’ accounts.

Should You Invest in Cryptocurrencies? (And What Are They Anyway?)
The short answer is “no”. Investing in cryptocurrencies is straight up speculation.










Worrying is a serious offense
Bob Seawright cautions that for most of us most of the time, worrying will surely be counterproductive, leading to bad decisions and poor returns.










The Bull Keeps Running
Brian Wesbury believes that those who stay optimistic will be richly rewarded. As such, he advises staying optimistic (and staying invested).










Every Time Stocks Fall…
Down days in the markets can play head games because it’s impossible to know whether a one day drop is the start of the next bear market.










How to Invest in an Overvalued Market
Ben Carlson reminds us that while you can’t control what the current market valuations are, you can control what you will do about them.










Fed Hikes Again, Sets Plan to Re-Normalize Balance Sheet
Brian Wesbury breaks down Wednesday’s Fed rate hike and statement.










Bulls, Bears & Charlatans
A market crash is always a possibility. But using scare tactics to get people out of the markets (or keep them in) isn’t helpful to anyone.










US Equity Correction? Prepare, Don’t Panic
It may sound counterintuitive, but there’s really no reason to panic when stocks fall. Corrections can be the best time to add to an equity allocation.










How is My Financial Advisor Compensated?
Why should you care how your advisor is paid? Because it can impact the choice of the products recommended to you and your return from those products.










The All or Nothing Bias
“The all or nothing bias” can cause us to forget that a portfolio doesn’t have to be perfect all the time. It just has to be appropriate and sustainable.

Retirement Plan Consulting



Improve investments, lower costs and reduce fiduciary liability

Put in simplest terms, the rules for retirement plans have changed. There are more regulations, more lawsuits and more scrutiny. On top of that, costs continue to rise. Our job is to help our clients navigate this increasingly complex landscape.			Doug McLeodManaging Director



In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and a recent Supreme Court decision, 401(k), pension and profit-sharing plans are under unprecedented scrutiny. In this increasingly regulated and litigious environment, plan sponsors are coming to the realization that this changing landscape requires an assessment and an evaluation of their existing plans. We work with retirement plans to improve investment options, lower costs and mitigate the fiduciary liability of plan sponsors.
Because every plan is different with unique goals and objectives, the same individualized approach we employ in wealth management is applied to retirement plan consulting. We work closely with plan sponsors, administrators and participants to ensure that their plan best suits their needs, and that it also complies with current ERISA and Department of Labor regulations and guidelines.
Many businesses, law firms and medical practices are paying too much for their retirement plans—a cost burden often passed on to individual plan participants. Compounding the problem is the fact that many plans have underperforming investment options that were selected for reasons other than their investment merits. Our commitment to open architecture empowers us to meet our fiduciary duty: providing plan options based entirely on their investment merits and designed to improve performance and reduce costs.
When we work with retirement plan clients, we consider ourselves caretakers—not only of the plan itself but also of its individual participants. Participant education is too often neglected or nonexistent, and our commitment to advising plan participants is integral to our fiduciary role as a retirement plan adviser. Our goal is to earn the confidence of the plan sponsor and the trust of each participant.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (6.29% upside)
