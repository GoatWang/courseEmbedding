Early chains: John R. Thompson

Although it is largely forgotten today, the Chicago-based John R. Thompson company was one of the largest “one arm” lunchroom chains of the early 20th century. We so strongly associate fast food chains with hamburgers that it may be surprising to learn that Thompson’s popular sandwiches included Cervelat, smoked boiled tongue, cold boiled ham, hot frankfurter, cold corned beef, cold salmon, and Herkimer County cheese, served on “Milwaukee Rye Bread” baked by the chain’s bakery. Thompson was proud that his meals were suited for sedentary office workers of the 1900s and 1910s. A 1911 advertisement claimed that lunch at Thompson’s “won’t leave you logy and lazy and dull this afternoon.”
Thompson, an Illinois farm boy, ran a rural general store as his first business. He sold it in 1891, moved to Chicago, and opened a restaurant on State Street. He proved to be a modernizer in the restaurant business as well as in politics.
He operated his restaurants on a “scientific” basis, stressing cleanliness, nutrition, and quality while keeping prices low. In 1912 he moved the chain’s commissary into a premier new building on North Clark Street (pictured, today). Thompson’s, then with 68 self-service lunchrooms plus a chain of grocery stores, became a public corporation in 1914, after which it expanded outside Chicago and into Canada. By 1921 there were 109 restaurants, 49 of which were in Chicago and 11 in New York (with a commissary in NYC). By the mid-1920s Thompson’s, Childs, and Waldorf Lunch were the big three U.S. chains, small by comparison to McDonald’s but significant nevertheless.
In politics Thompson served as a Republican committeeman and managed the campaign of a “good government” gubernatorial candidate in 1904. A few years later he failed in his own bid to run for mayor, promising he would bring efficiency to government while improving schools and roads. In the 1920s he financed a personal crusade against handguns.
Despite John R. Thompson’s progressive politics, his business would go down in history as one that refused to serve Afro-Americans. Or, as civil rights leader Marvin Caplan put it in 1985, “If the chain is remembered today, it is not for its food, but for its refusal to serve it.” J. R. died in 1927. Where he stood on the question of public accommodations is unclear but the chain faced numerous lawsuits by blacks in the 1930s. However the best known case occurred in 1950 when a group of integrationists led by Mary Church Terrell was refused service in a Washington D.C. Thompson’s. The group was looking for a case that would test the validity of the district’s 19th-century public accommodations laws. After three years in the courts the Thompson case (for which the Washington Restaurant Association raised defense funds) made its way to the Supreme Court which affirmed the so-called “lost” anti-discrimination laws of 1872 and 1873 as valid.
Over the years the Thompson chain absorbed others, including Henrici’s and Raklios. At some point, possibly in the 1950s, the original Thompson’s concept was dropped. By 1956 Thompson’s operated Holloway House and Ontra cafeterias. In 1971, as Green Giant prepared to buy Thompson’s, it had about 100 restaurants, including Red Balloon family restaurants, Henrici’s restaurants, and Little Red Hen Chicken outlets.

I worked at the Red Balloon at rand road and central road in DesPlaines between 1967 and 1972. Manager Pete Covel was a wonderful boss to work for. With the cocktail lounge and the element that it drew, I learned so much about life and people. I will never forget those memories

Oops. reread the article which says JR died in 1927, so that must have been John Riley Jr. and JR Sr and Elizabeth Wright were parents.

Just went to the Illiana Genealogy and History Center in Danville IL yesterday to research my Thompson line. My mother was a Thompson and she mentioned in her later years having gone to the Thompson restaurant in Chicago once or twice as a child. She wasn’t sure of the connection with her father. My great X2 grandfather was Andrew Jackson Thompson, John Riley’s eldest brother. They came from PA to IL in 1859 where they both settled near Fithian. There is a fat file on the Thompson’s here and many helpful DAR ladies. Saw an illustration of the Chicago restaurant but nothing from New York.

I just read the website write up on Thompsons again, and it does say the chain expanded into Canada. I’ll have to do a little digging to see where the restaurants were, but I’m assuming in Ontario.

Oops! Back to my computer today and I found in my notes a story that says that when the company became public in 1914 it planned to open 30 restaurants in Canada, in all the principal cities.

All I can tell you is that it opened on West 9th street in Evergreen Park in 1969, and was a family smorgasbord type restaurant. It was owned by the John R. Thompson Co. which also owned Red Balloon and Holloway House restaurants also.

Some years ago, I purchased a coffee cup, white with lovely blue patterning and “Thompson’s” in script across the front.  As I unloaded the dw this evening, my curiosity prompted me to Google “J.R. Thompson China” as stamped on the bottom.  I found it amusing to drink coffee at my office from this mug, as my married name is Thompson. My husband’s family hailed from Indianola in southern Illinois.  Now another curiosity presents itself.  Wonder if the families were related?  Will continue my research.  I live in Kalamazoo, MI, and I see there was a Thompson’s in Grand Rapids, MI where my family lived and where I was born.  Indeed interesting coincidences discovered from just reading the bottom of my coffee mug.

I have an advertisement printed on an 2.5″ x 4.5″ (old) card that reads: “The Thompson Restaurant 397 S. State Street, Chicago. Regular Meals Elegantly Served for 25 cents. Newly Fitted, Larger and Better Than Ever. The Only Open New England Kitchen in Chicago. Especial Attention Paid to Ladies and Children. John R. Thompson, Jr. Prop. Open Day and Night…”

I find the reference to “New England Kitchen” fascinating. I wonder if it refers to the experimental “food station” of that name started by Ellen Richards (“mother of home economics”, chemist, first woman to be admitted to MIT) in Boston in 1890, designed to provide affordable nutritious meals to the working poor? I know John Thompson was a reformer in the area of gun control who wanted to do away with all handguns. It’s possible he had ambitions to improve the American restaurant-goer’s diet also.
Thanks for sharing!

Hello Laurie — That is awesome.  Could you e-mail me at regina_fostino@yahoo.com … I’d love to see what it looks like — my great grandfather George Fostino (Giorgio Faustini) worked for that restaurant in 1919 before he was drafted to WWI.  Could you send me a picture of the card? How amazing. I gave a matchbook cover from that restaurant to my father (his grandfather) for his recent 60th birthday — it was the best gift ever.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you!

I would doubt it is worth nearly that much, though maybe $20 or $30. This is just a guess based on what most restaurant coins bring on eBay. There is currently one listed for $199 but I believe that is a fantasy price.

I worked as the inplant printer at JR Thompson I think in the 70’s. When cleaning up some print storage areas I found a lot of pictures dating back to their early opening. If it was not for me they might have been lost forever in a move when bought out by Green Giant Foods. Green Giant bought them to help run some restaurants they had that were not as successful as Thompsons. You might try contacting Green Giant and requesting copies. Originally I turned them over to the advertising department. But you may want to do more research. These are fantastic historical pictures. By the way by then they were hiring blacks so I guess when the old boy died they had a change of policy.

My dad worked at a Thompson’s restaurant in1930 – 1938 in Chicago as night manager.  I don’t know which one.  But he remembers some of the gangsters in the area coming in to have a meal.  They were friendly to him.  Called him “Slim” and probably enjoyed his Southern accent.

At the time of his death in 1947, my Grandfather, William W. Walker, was Vice President and General Manager of Thompson’s. If anyone has information about his tenure or knew him, responses would be greatly appreciated. I found his obit in a July issue of “What’s Cookin.” My Grandfather passed away before my birth, so again, any information would be appreciated.

Our paternal grandfather was the head chemist for Thompson’s headquarters in Chicago.  He worked for Thompson’s after he graduated from college, before WWI, then came back to Thompson’s after the war.  He retired from Thompson’s around 1958 or so.  There were a couple articles where he is featured in the Thompson’s house organ.  His name:  Edward A Castle

I doubt seriously they were silver. A chain like this would not buy flatware made from silver. They are either stainless (in their later years) or plated brass in the earlier years.

John Porter. Do you know anything about this chain–what the name was or anything at all? Thanks

The chain was known as the Capitol Lunch System. Porter and Blanchard were partners as early as 1909 according to a Norwich CT directory. The chain seems to have still been in business into the 1920s, at least in Connecticut. In Worcester it had been taken over by the Waldorf Lunch System (a larger chain based in Boston) by 1923.

One of John R Thompson’s daughters, Florence, was my grandmother her son, John R Thomas, was my father passed away in February 2015. I’m creating an eBook about the early Thompson Family for my posterity and would be very much interested in the coin referenced above.

Hello Deirdre, my grandfather Edward Castle worked for Thompson’s restaurant for 40 years in Chicago. He was a chemist, started working for Thompson’s in 1916. We have a few magazines that have articles about my grandfather’s lab, and great pictures as well. Do you know by chance how I could buy old Thompson dishes from their restaurants? I have been combing ebay and buying up everything that I’ve found, but not much is available. I will make sure to follow up on the booklet you recommended. My grandfather actually was stationed as a chemist during WW1, and mentioned in letters to my grandmother that Thompson’s was suffering because lack of men to work, due to the war. They took him back as soon as he was sent home from duty, and worked his entire career there.

Bill;
In reviewing your post I see that you might have some source information on Francis P Thompson who was a sibling of John R. Thompson the restaurateur.  Their father was John Riley Thompson and Elizabeth Wright; they had a very large family in the Fithian, Vermillion, Illinois area. John R Thompson the restaurateur was my great grandfather.  His daughter Florence is my grandmother.  I have been trying to resolve the gender of Frances which shows up in the 1880 US Census as a son to John Riley Thompson and Elizabeth Wright.  However it is noted that the gender box of the census has been smudged so the male or female is not legible.  I noticed that there is a My Heritage Family Tree that has Francis as a female and married to a George E. Harrison in 1894 but provides no sources. The My Heritage Family tree manager has no information to confirm the info posted in their tree. Do you have any source info to confirm the gender of Francis such as marriage or death certificate or cemetery info, etc.
I would really appreciate any source info that could lead me to the gender question.  My direct email is hthomas618@gmail.com

Ed,
Could you put a picture up of the coin?  It sounds very interesting.

Note that there was another restauranteur in Chicago prior to my great grandfather (John R Thompson) by the name of SH Thompson. The coin must be from his restaurant as JR Thompson did not come to Chicago until the Chicago Worlds Fair.

I’m the great grandaughter of J. R. Thompson, and much of our family history wasn’t passed down.  I’m so glad to have this info.  Thanks very much for posting it!

I’ve heard this from quite a few people who had ancestors in the restaurant business. I think it was a business that people did not have much respect for in the past, but by today’s point of view your grandfather was a very successful business man.

Interesting point about respect for restaurants at the turn of the century. Restaurants were not under the more stringent health inspections they are today and people were naturally cautious about eating in them. Thompson’s was one of the first chains to adapt a white tile interior to show patrons they were clean. Food preparation was standardized. I have several posters I found on the walls of the old commissary in Chicago that admonished the food prep staff to always wash their hands.

Peter,
My Grandfather always talked about the keeping the kitchen clean…He would go into EVERY restaurant kitchen, before we sat down in the restaurant to eat… and inspect them….He passed down all his rules to my parents in our home kitchen….I work for a gentleman now who owns a few restaurants and wanted all the office help to take a kitchen health test and with no studying I was the only one who passed with a 100 %….I laughed and said my Grandfather would be proud….

Ruth,
I’m the granddaughter of BR Morgan who managed a few of your grandfather’s restaurants. BR  Morgan started in Ill where JR got him into the Masons and a 32nd degree while he was a young man. He met my grandmother when she was working at the Atlanta Ga restaurant and my mother was born in Birmingham Al while he was managing that one……He eventually moved on and had his own restaurant called Morgans on Press Plaza in Asbury Park NJ. I have met people who remember my Grandfather while he was managing in Ill…..and they all seem to remember Thompson’s pies.  Somewhere my family has a picture of the interior of the Thompson’s in Birmingham Al in the 1930’s with my Grandfather standing up front in a 3 piece suit. I was very pleased to find this site….I have had so many people talk to me about Thompson’s.

Cris,
Hello to a fellow Thompson-kin.  And thank you for sharing your family history with me.  I didn’t know that JR was a mason.  He died a few years after my father was born, and my grandmother never mentioned the restaurant.  It’s great to hear about it from other sources.
I am also grateful for Jan’s website.  Thompson’s was a big part of American history, and a true ‘rags to riches’ story.   Your memories are much appreciated, Ruth

If you contact my niece  Deidre in this thread she has access to several  bound volumes of the monthly Thompson magazine for all Thompson employees. If you give her dates she can see if there are any articles mentioning BR Morgan or the restaurants he managed.

This is Peter Pook. Are you David & Jean Owen’s daughter? If so it’s been about 30 years since Polly & I last saw you in your Milwaukee home.

Hi PD,
Yes, I’m Ruth Owen, Dave and Jean’s daughter.  We moved to Florida in the seventies. My brother Dave and sister Francie all live within a few miles of each other. Mom is in a nursing home close by as well. Dad passed away a few years ago, and I understand Uncle Pete did as well. I was sorry to hear of his passing. Time slips by so fast.  This site is wonderful. I’ve learned so much of our family history. I hope you are well, and please give my best to your family and brothers and sisters. Good to get back in touch, Ruth

Please fill me in on the family and I’ll do the same. My direct email address is peterpook@bell.net. Look forward to hearing from you. I believe I have many early photos of your father I’d be happy to share.
Best  PD

Ruth;
I was reading this blog and came across your comments. I’m a great-grandson of John R Thompson. His daughter, Florence, was my grandmother and her son, John R Thomas, was my father passed away in February of 2015. I’m amazed that there was not much history passed down of the Thompson Family.  I’m trying to create an ebook of the Thompson Family Ancestry History for my posterity I have 3 children and 6 grandchildren. I was starting with John R Thompson and his siblings and working back through the ancestors as far as I can go. I would appreciate any info you can provide.  I retired last year at 65 yrs old and suspect that this will keep me busy for a few years.
Thanks,
Harry Thomas

It’s nice to meet you, Harry.  I think it’s a wonderful idea to collect Thompson Family History.  I’m not sure that I can point you to one source–most of our information has been gleaned from internet searches and of course there is the Thompson Building in downtown Chicago.  Unfortunately, we don’t have much information on John R.’s ancestors, though I’d suggest searching on Fithian, IL where he was born. I’m afraid not too knowledgable about them.
Good luck and if I find anything of interest, I’ll let you know.
Sincerely, Ruth Owen (daughter of David J. Owen, grand-daughter of Ruth Thompson Owen McGibney)

Do you have the small accordion folded color brochure  showing illustrations of all the various meals? Last I saw it it was in the bookshelves in the old livingroom at Montegue. If you do have it would you scan & send me each image ( about 8 of them) One was shown in Jan’s blog.

Hi Deirdre,
Do you have a photograph of the Thompson’s Restaurant located at 104 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL ?
I gave my father a matchbook cover from Thompson’s Restaurant for his 60th birthday yesterday, and was wondering if there was a picture of the building to go with it!
Thanks!

Good Morning Good Folks, Concerning Thompson’s Lunch Room in Grand Central Terminal, may I ask some knowledgeable good person if they have any history, stories, photos if possible about that particular location. I am a Custodian for a Railroad Library in Grand Central Terminal. The Williamson Library is run by a non-profit group called The Railroad Enthusiasts of New York. There is very little info about that particular Lunchroom — we know of a poem written about it & that’s about it. Any insights would be appreciated greatly. Thanks.

It’s interesting that people in different countries have the same idea at the same time. Thompson’s reminds me of Aschinger in Berlin, a very popular local chain at the end of the 19th century, also with self-service. I wrote about it some months ago.

Well, Mr. Murphy, this was a time when food congloms were swallowing up restaurant congloms so as to mutually invigorate both. I think we all know how that went down.

GREDING) 10 years ago when I had my first root canal.This is my 3rd visit and let me tell you I am NOT a big fan of dentist since my last dentist accidentally sutured my check to my gum, I have been scared to death of dentists in general.The first time I found them they were willing to see me on the same day! I was in excruciating pain and decided to finally give in and fix things up.When I arrived I had a wonderful smiley faces of Heather and Macy Greet and check me in, she was so nice and welcoming!5 minutes later I was called in.The dentist did a thorough exam and we found that all the pain was from a root canal that had not properly been done and had to be re-treated!He advised me to go to a specialist that he recommended and they booked me an apt for 30 min later. I was seen, cleaned up and the pain was gone !!! My old dentist didn't reach all the canals, so it had gotten badly infected. Thankfully they fixed it all.Then I went back for a crown and to fix other cavities. I recommend DR. Greding to EVERYONE !!!!!!!! If you want a dentist that actually cares and doesn't only care about the Money go see him! His main priority was to get me out of pain and getting everything done well! I completely trust him!OFFICEThe office is very clean, modern and well decorated! They also have every machine under the sun such as the cerac machine which make the crowns in minutes!! How cool is that. Witt my old dentist it took 2 days to make which meant more time off work.CUSTOMER SERVICESo far the service here has been top notchI am always greeted by name as I arrive with a smile and everyone seems genuinely happy to work here!!!Speaking of great service, I need to mention Stacey! Wow! She was so knowledgeable and made a simple affordable monthly payment plan for me so I could fix all my issues this year! PRICEvery fair they are not overpriced and since I was in network my insurance went pretty farFINAL VERDICT-I love love love this place and highly recommend it!Cottle Brad L DDSTom W. ratedDr Cottle is probably a very good dentist but knows very little about dentures. I went to him with broken uppers. Who ever did the lab work was sloppy and left a lot of material on the crown leaving it Very Uncomfortable. Dr Cottle just put them in without giving them a chance to settle. He did no testing with carbon paper to check for bite and alignment. By the time I got home my mouth was hurting like hell. So, I called for another appointment and one looked at by another dentist in that office. She sent the dentures to the technician and when they came back I put them in and again there were no tests or checks made to see if they were fitted properly and they weren't. So l took out my trusty Dremel and ground off the excess material to a point where they weren't as painful. The bite is still off enough to keep bitting the inside of my mouth. My advice is to buy a Dremel tool before getting any denture work here.Gentle DentalBecky P. ratedI took my 79 yr old client to this place.  She needed 2 teeth pulled. I asked the oral surgeon,  " Don't you have to give antibiotics and wait before you pull a abbcessed tooth?" She said , " No I will numb it good."   I went to the waiting room to wait and that's when I heard my clients screams. When she came out she said, 1 the Dentist said "that doesn't hurt" wile she was pulling it. She then pulled the second one after numbing it again..  right after that she walked out of the room.  This was so unacceptable with the  pain meds we have today. Don't let her pull your tooth if you have infection. No compassion from a Dr that should have it.The employees were very nice and friendly as was the dental assistant.Dobson Ranch Family DentistryDaniel G. ratedA very professional yet causal office. I was totally comfortable and didn't even need to take a Xanax to keep me from having a panic attack which is the norm with all the other Dentists I have gone to. I did Dentist shopping every six months when it came time for my bi-annual exam and cleaning. I have finally found the Dental Practice I want to keep. It took me two years, but well worth it. A totally professional visit. Soothing music and a staff that is friendly, compassionate and work as a team that runs like a fine-tuned machine. Normally I'm anxious but found myself comfortable without the use of Xanax within 10 minutes. This team won me handover from the last there dentists I had beforehand. Kudos.Axiom Dentistrymysonispainlessnow ratedMy son is only 7 years old and always been very afraid of dentists.  He had lots of cavities and was in pain.  We decided to check out this office.  First thing I noticed was that the office was very clean.  and also kid friendly.  The doctor was also very good with my son.  My son didn't feel any pain when he gave a shot.  I have never seen my son so calm in dental chair before.  He explained the procedure very well so that  someone non-dental person like me can understand.  I think he said baby rootcanal and a filling on my son was done.  Also prescribed some antibiotics for my son. I really appreciate the discount as well since I didn't have any dental insurance yet.Aesthetic Family Dental Caremarty.manning ratedI've had really great experiences here.  Courtney the hygienist was terrific on my first visit, and the office is really a friendly comfortable place.  Then I had an old filling replaced ..  amazing!  I literally felt no pain at all ... Dr Wallin was so careful with the needle that I actually did not feel it at all.  I had no residual pain that night, and the surface match with my other teeth was perfect, no need for touchup.  They also have a really cool panoramic digital x-ray that lets you see a 360 degree view of your skull, bones, teeth, everything.  I would definitely recommmend them to my best friend.Vibrant Dentistrymrscox6412 ratedAs someone with extreme anxiet...As someone with extreme anxiety over going to the dentist, I would give Dr Metz and his staff an A+. They are always patient with me and very kind. I have had first hand experience with everyone who works in this office and do not have a single bad thing to say. With great bedside manner and professionalism, Dr. Metz and his staff have now worked on my teeth 3 times and I haven't had a single issue. Dr. Metz displays great professionalism and lets you know exactly what he is doing every step of the way and does his best to make sure you are an informed consumer of his dental care. Spring Family Dentalgulzeb.lodhi ratedI've been going to Spring Family Dental for routine teeth cleanings for about a year now. So far, I've yet to have a cavity, but in the event that I did, Dr. Spring is definitely the one I would turn to for help. He and has staff have a gentleness of approach and disposition that I have found sorely lacking at other offices. I rarely leave the office with sore or bleeding gums and appreciate that Dr. Spring and his staff take such care when treating their patients. If you've got children who need dental work, I would enthusiastically recommend Spring Family Dental for this reason. Axiom Dentistrynomoretoothpain ratedI just had my molar root canal done in this office last week due to severe cavity.  I was in horrible pain for a few days until i couldn't take it anymore.  I really don't like going to a dental office but I am so glad I came here.  After I had the root canal done here by the doctor here, I was in no pain.  Also one of the staff members called me very next day to check up on me to see how I am doing.  I really appreciated that.  I only came here because this office was referred to me by a family friend who had some work done there before.  I will be coming here from now on.     Red Mountain DentalRalph B. ratedI have been going to see Dr. Clifford since the year 2000. He and his staff have been the most incredible people I could ever ask for in the field of Dentistry. I have never had anything close to an unpleasant or bad experience. Everyone from the office staff on have always treated me with dignity respect and professionalism. The quality of care that I have gotten has been unsurpassed. I have moved since I first started seeing him and I now have to drive almost 45 minutes and it's worth it. I highly recommend Red Mountain Dental!Did You Know?Types of DentistsThe human mouth is a complex biological system, and no two individuals have the same oral care needs. Here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral health:General Dentist
These dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care. If you need your teeth cleaned, crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures, book an appointment with a general dentist. Though not as common, these dentists will also provide more specialized services, including some forms of oral surgery - chief among them root canals and restorative care - fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutrition.Endodontist
To become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school. As a result, these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work. While a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week, an endodontist may end up working on 20 or more in the same timespan. Your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments, which is repeat root canal procedure. Their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment - especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes. Most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformities.Pediatric Dentist
Proper oral care starts when you're young, and that's why pediatric dentists are so important. These dentists treat people under the age of 13, though there are exceptions based on a child's unique dental background. Pediatric dentists face unique challenges, because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeth.Though cleanings are an integral part of their job, pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead. That means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite. However, they also help address more child-specific conditions of thumb sucking and an over-reliance on pacifiers. As a result, pediatric dentists usually require an additional two-year residency working with infants and children.Oral Pathologist
Pathology refers to the study of disease, specifically as it presents in tissue. Oral pathologists, then, are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups. These experts are considered to be true specialists, having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology. Though oral pathology is rather specialized, it's a vital component of the oral health industry. By analyzing tissue taken from biopsies, oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases, including leukoplakia, cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among others.Periodontist
Similar to the endodontist, periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school. However, whereas endodontists study advanced treatments, periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest. Your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis, periodontitis, which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment, and other periodontal diseases. Periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds, those people who require root planing - where dentists clean any infected surfaces - and root debridement, or the removal of dead tissue. Periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health, including painful recession and teeth alignment.Cosmetic Dentist
Most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and well-being of a patient's teeth. While that is important to cosmetic dentists, they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth. To begin the average appointment, cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities, and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned. The most popular such treatments are bleaching - where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth - placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth, and bonding, where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement material.Orthodontist
Orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities, which includes everything from misaligned jaws - like an under or overbite - to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues. Following dental school, the would-be orthodontist then has another three years of schooling, most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program. To properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues, the orthodontist relies on a collection of corrective gear. That includes braces, retainers and various facemask configurations. Though orthodontists work with people of all ages, the bulk of patients are young children and teens.Prosthodontist
Similar to the field of orthodontics, the average prosthodontist receives an additional three years of training following dental school. And though prosthodontics is something of a cosmetic field like orthodontics, it's primarily concerned with replacing missing teeth. Prosthodontists have a number of teeth-replacing procedures to implement, including filling veneers, onlays and inlays, bridges, crowns and complete or partial dentures. Beyond their work in implant dentistry, these experts treat a number of other mouth-related ailments, namely snoring, post-cancer jaw reconstruction, traumatic injuries and pain related to lock jaw and other temporomandibular joint disorders.Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist
Similar to endodontists, these specialists - one of nine such unique fields recognized by the American Dental Association - utilize machinery to treat and diagnose patients. Specifically, these dentists make use of radiographic imaging to treat those diseases and ailments that impact the teeth, mouth and the maxillofacial region, which consists of the face and jaw. While X-rays are a popular option, OMRs also rely on plain and computed tomography, MRIs, ultrasounds and other forms of digital imaging. OMRs are among the first adaptors of new technology, using innovations in the field of imaging to find increasingly effective ways at understanding the impact of oral disease and what that means to patients.Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon
Your primary dentist may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon if you experience facial pain, or if he or she suspects you have some variety of oral cancer. OMSs are also your primary source when planning most oral surgeries, like tooth extractions, cyst repairs and removals, and dental implants. However, an OMS can also treat a number of other ailments and diseases related to the maxillofacial region. For instance, malformations in your facial bones can cause sleep apnea, and an OMS can perform corrective surgery that removes or shapes bone. Many of these experts are also involved with more cosmetic procedures, performing or assisting with facial implants and rhinoplasty, in which the nose bone is modified.Dental Public Health Clinics
These clinics are available in most cities across the U.S., and they're meant to offer affordable health care to many low-income families and individuals. Though it differs depending on the specific clinic, the average clinic offers only the most essential oral care services, including X-rays, teeth cleaning, basic root canals and repairs, and tooth extractions. The fees an individual pays depend on a number of different factors, and most clinics have a sliding-fee that is determined equally by income and family size.Most Common Oral Care IssuesThere are several different kinds of dentists, each one with his or her own specialty. However, there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat. Conditions include:Tooth Decay: When your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth, improper brushing is often to blame. Certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay. One of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at home.Bad Breath: As your teeth fall out or you don't brush properly, your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors. Other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections. As with tooth decay, brushing and flossing are vital, as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwash.Teeth Sensitivity: Some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold. A lack of brushing can also comprise your teeth's natural protection. The best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teeth.Dry Mouth: Certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit. This in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums. There are several at-home measures you can take to combat dry mouth. These include regular hydration, chewing sugar-free gum, which also hydrates your mouth, and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it, which dries out your entire mouth.Teeth Grinding: For many people, grinding their teeth - also known as bruxism - is a subconscious behavior, usually the result of stress. It can eventually damage your teeth. The only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist, who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teeth.Mouth Sores: Also called canker sores, these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth. These sores can make brushing almost impossible. There are a number of different causes for sores, including anemia or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. As a result, your primary physician will have to examine the bump, find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan, including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwash.Discoloration: Yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits, mainly smoking, drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition. Proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen. However, if your teeth become worse, many dentists will treat with a whitening procedure.A Guide for Dental Care BasicsProper oral care begins at home. The following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They just may reduce your time spent in your dentist's chair.Remember Your Angles
When brushing your teeth, always place the brush at a 45-degree angle. That way, you're able to hit every surface of each tooth.Don't Forget the Tongue
Within your mouth, your tongue is the largest source of bacteria. Be sure to brush it front to back and don't forget the sides.Floss Everyday
Brushing alone isn't enough to keep your mouth healthy, and that's why flossing is so important. Each time you floss, be sure to have at least 18 inches of floss available, which is what you should go through if you use proper technique. For optimal control, hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingers.Watch What You Eat
Sugar, alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus. While some can prove beneficial, too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gums.Keep in Mind the Mouthwash
Though not a requirement, mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing. Most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide, a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains. However, don't overuse mouthwash, as it can cause a number of ailments.How to Choose The Right DentistProper oral care is an integral component of your greater well-being, which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance. Consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical history:Find a Recommendation
It's important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with. Because that's difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book, you should always seek out a recommendation. Whether it's a friend, family member or co-worker, this individual can offer intimate details about a dentist's demeanor, operating style and approach to patient care. Be sure to always ask plenty of questions.Vet Your Dentist
Once you get a recommendation from a friend, don't simply book your first cleaning right away. Instead, meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview. During this session, you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often, procedures they're not as familiar with, what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments. Just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentist's schedule.Consider Accessibility and Other Factors
Perhaps you've met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable. Not only that, but this dentist's payment options are suitable for your finances. However, don't be so quick to make a final decision, as other factors may influence your choice. Is the dentist's office nearby, or do you have to drive out of your way? Is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule? How much flexibility will the dentist's staff offer in booking appointments? Though seemingly trivial, these factors are nonetheless important.Check With Your State Board
One of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your state's dental board. Dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice, and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet. These organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentist's background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actions.Picking the Right Dental InsuranceAs with other forms of health care, insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible. However, you don't want to simply buy the first such plan you see. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurance:Pick Your Plan
There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all dental insurance plan. Instead, most people purchase three main varieties, usually through their employers. An indemnity or fee-for-service plan is just as it sounds and means you'll have to pay for annual deductibles and co-insurance payments out of pocket. A preferred provider organization is less costly, and you choose from a network of dentists. However, PPOs have some limitations and accompanying deductibles. Similarly, a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists, and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs. However, these HMO are usually much less costly.Examine the Networks
As noted, PPO plans and dental HMOs work with only a select number of doctors. While that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options, it also means you don't have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you. That doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, especially if you know who is in the network. Before purchasing the plan, you'll receive a list of dentists in each network. Do research on each doctor - just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise. From there, you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirements.Consider Your Coverage
Sometimes, it's not just the doctor that you want to consider. For many people, even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice. The reason? The coverage is less-than-stellar. When picking a plan, you need to look at just how much you'll pay for each and every service. For instance, some plans won't cover your fillings or X-rays, while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction. Knowing just what you'll be responsible for is important, as you don't want to be caught off-guard by unforeseen charges. Depending on your employer, a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage options.Make Your Plan Work for You
It's a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan you've purchased. However, that doesn't mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere. If you're truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen, then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available. That means potentially deal with costs and other insurance-related factors that you might have wanted to. If need be, you might be able to work with the dentist's office to address some of the plan-specific concerns.
