Ready to Retire




Are you ready to retire? Congratulations! You've reached that long-awaited milestone, and now it's time to reap the rewards of your many years of service.
How you apply for benefits in retirement depends on which MERS plan you have. If you're not sure what MERS Plan you have, click here for help.
I'd like retirement information about: Defined Benefit Plan  •  Defined Contribution Plan  •  Hybrid Plan  •  Health Care Savings Program  •  457 Program
 
 
Defined Benefit Plan

You can begin receiving retirement benefits when you reach the age and service requirements under your plan provisions. Quick Bite Webinar
(Recorded: 5/8/2015)
Ready To Retire - Defined Benefit Retirement
Process, click to view video.If you are vested, the standard retirement age is 60.
When you meet the age and service requirements, you're ready to start the retirement process.
Here's how to get started:

Complete the Application for Defined Benefit Retirement (Form 29) within 45-90 days of your anticipated retirement date and submit to MERS. You will want to log into your myMERS account to calculate your benefit estimate and determine which payment option you will elect on your application.
MERS will process your information. This may take up to 6 weeks to review your file and make necessary calculations.
MERS will send a personalized calculation of your expected benefits with a letter confirming your retirement elections.
Your retirement date will be the first day of the month following your termination date, or the first day of the month following MERS' receipt of your retirement application, whichever is later. Payments are issued electronically on the 18th of each month, unless it falls on a weekend or holiday, in which case the payment will be issued the business day prior.

Payment Options
When you retire, you choose one of three methods of payment that works for you:

Straight Life — the highest monthly payment paid for your lifetime, with no monthly survivor benefits.
Life with 100%, 75%, or 50% to survivor — a reduced monthly benefit that provides a chosen percentage to one beneficiary for life if you die.
Life with 20, 15, 10, or 5 year period certain — provides a monthly benefit to you as long as you live. If you die before the period certain ends, your beneficiary(ies) receives your payment until the period certain ends.

Please select your payment option carefully; you can't change it afterward.
For more information, please review your Defined Benefit Plan Member Handbook or contact our Service Center.

Defined Contribution Plan

When you're ready to retire, you have many choices for what to do with your Defined Contribution account.
You can: 

keep your account with us;
Build up your existing account balance by rolling in other qualified plan assets as a way to continue to save for retirement while taking advantage of MERS low fees and investment options
roll over all or a portion of your account to another qualified one;
begin withdrawing money from your account. 

There are no deadlines for making these decisions, so take your time and weigh your options carefully. By keeping your account in the MERS Defined Contribution Plan, you’ll continue to receive the benefits of MERS Investment Menu, low administrative fees, and excellent customer service.
Before you decide what to do with your account, you should consider the tax consequences of receiving payments. We encourage you to contact your financial advisor for more information about which option is best for you.
If you want to move all or a portion of your account:

Complete any necessary paperwork your employer requires.
Login to your myMERS account and request a Distribution through the portal, or download and complete the Defined Contribution Distribution Form (MD-005) on our website.
Follow the instructions and mail the completed form to Alerus.

Distribution Options
There are several ways you may choose to receive payments from your defined contribution account after employment — lump sum, substantially equal payments, periodic, amount certain, or period certain. Please note that all payments are taxable in the calendar year you receive the money. We are also required to apply mandatory withholding for federal and any applicable state income taxes, although in some instances you may opt out of this withholding.
Before you decide what to do with your account, you should consider the tax consequences of receiving payments. You're not required to take payments until age 70 1/2, when you must begin taking required minimum distributions.
If you are married and your vested balance is equal to or more than $1,000, you must choose the Joint and Survivor Life Income payment option under the MERS Stable Income Annuity, unless your spouse consents in writing to another type of payment.
Note: If you are ready to retire and would like to roll over or withdraw funds from your MERS Defined Contribution Plan, you can now submit your request online through your myMERS account. This new feature eliminates the need to fill out and submit a paper form to request your distribution, saving you time and postage!
To do so, log into myMERS and click on the link for the product you’re requesting a distribution from on the left navigation bar on the page, then click on “Manage Account.” Next click on the “Distributions” link on the left navigation bar to make your request.
Medallion Signature Guarantee
Medallion Signature Guarantees will now be required for the following types of distributions:

Any request to have funds wired or sent via direct deposit.
Any distribution greater than $100,000 received via paper form.
Online requests that are greater than $100,000 will not require the medallion signature guarantee unless the participant is requesting that the funds are send via wire or direct deposit. The $100,000 refers to the total distribution amount; if a participant was requesting a rollover for $40,000 and a cash distribution of $60,000, a Medallion Signature Guarantee would be required.
Any address that is different than what is in the myMERS system.
Any address that is outside of the United States.

The Medallion Signature Guarantee can be obtained at most banks and credit unions. This guarantee authenticates the validity of the request (and the requestor) and protects you by making it harder for people to take your money by forging your signature on your securities certificates or related documents. Note: a Medallion Signature Guarantee is not the same as a notary. Consult with your Medallion signature provider on possible additional fees.
Please send all distribution forms that require a Medallion Signature Guarantee to our recordkeeper, Alerus. These forms cannot be accepted via e-mail, online or fax (the original "signature" is required).  The Alerus address can be found on the distribution form. Distribution forms can be found in the “Resource Library” link at the top of your Defined Contribution or MERS 457 Account page on myMERS.
For more information on Medallion signature guarantees, click here.
Questions 
If you have any questions, please consult your Defined Contribution Member Handbook or contact our Service Center.

Hybrid Plan

The two parts of the MERS Hybrid Plan give you a variety of options at retirement: Hybrid Part I – Defined Benefit Portion When you meet the age and service requirements, you're ready to start the retirement process.
Here's how to get started:
 

Complete the Application for Defined Benefit Retirement (Form 29) within 45-90 days of your anticipated retirement date and submit to MERS. You will want to log into your myMERS account to calculate your benefit estimate and determine which payment option you will elect on your application.
MERS will process your information. This may take up to 6 weeks to review your file and make necessary calculations.
MERS will send a personalized Retirement Allowance Schedule providing a preliminary calculation of your expected benefits with a letter confirming your retirement elections.
Your retirement date will be the first day of the month following your termination date, or the first day of the month following MERS receipt of your retirement application, whichever is later. Payments are issued electronically on the 18th of each month, unless it falls on a weekend or holiday, in which case the payment will be issued the business day prior.

 
Hybrid Plan Part I — Types of Payment
When you retire, you will be able to choose the type of payment that works for you:

Straight Life — highest monthly payment paid for your lifetime, with no monthly survivor benefits
Life with 100%, 75%, or 50% to survivor — a reduced monthly benefit that provides a chosen percentage to your beneficiary for life if you die. 
Life with 20, 15, 10, or 5 year period certain — provides a lifetime benefit for you. If you should die before the certain period ends, your beneficiary will also receive a benefit for the remainder of the chosen period. 

Hybrid Part II — Defined Contribution Portion
With the defined contribution portion of your Hybrid Plan, it's easy to set your plans in motion. Just follow these simple steps:

Complete any necessary paperwork your employer requires.
Download and complete the Defined Contribution Distribution Form (MD-005) on our website.
Mail or fax the completed form to us at 517.703.9706.

Distribution Options There are several ways you may choose to receive payments from your defined contribution account – lump sum, substantially equal payments, periodic, amount certain, or period certain. Please note that all payments are taxable in the calendar year you receive the money. We are also required to apply mandatory withholding for federal and any applicable state income taxes, although in some instances you may opt out of this withholding.
If you are married and your vested balance is equal to or more than $1,000, you must choose the Joint and Survivor Life Income payment option under the MERS Stable Income Annuity, unless your spouse consents in writing to another type of payment.
For more information on retiring, please consult your MERS Hybrid Retirement Plan Member Handbook or call our Service Center.

Health Care Savings Plan

Once you separate from your employer (either at retirement or otherwise), you can begin to use your Health Care Savings Program account to receive reimbursements for qualified medical expenses.
There are three different ways to be reimbursed:

mySourceCard® Debit Card — that automatically debits your account when making qualified medical expense purchases. This smart card identifies qualified medical expenses when you use it. You can request a mySourceCard® on your myMERS Online Access, or by calling our Service Center.
Online Reimbursements — You can upload receiptsusing myMERS. Processing your request takes two business days. All reimbursements are made by direct deposit.
Reimbursement by Mail or Fax — Submit requests by mail or fax, using a reimbursement form along with a copy of the applicable receipts. Please call our Service Center to request Reimbursement and Direct Deposit forms. 

For more information, consult the MERS Health Care Savings Program Participant Handbook or call our Service Center.

457 Program

When you're ready to retire, you have many choices for what to do with your MERS 457 Program account.
You can: 

keep your account with us;
roll over all or a portion of your account to another qualified one;
begin withdrawing money from your account. 

There are no deadlines for making these decisions, so take your time and weigh your options carefully. We encourage you to contact your financial advisor for more information about which option is best for your situation.
Before you decide what to do with your account, you should consider the tax consequences of receiving payments. You're not required to take payments until age 70 1/2, when you must begin taking required minimum distributions.
If you want to move all or a portion of your account:

Complete any necessary paperwork your employer requires.
Download and complete the 457 Distribution/Direct Rollover Form (MD-405) on our website.
Mail or fax the completed form to us at 517.703.9706.

For more information on this program, consult your MERS 457 Supplemental Retirement Program Participant Handbook or contact our Service Center.

	Our municipalities are represented in every county and every corner of Michigan, from the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula, to our southern border in Berrien County — and growing every day. We began with just 13 municipalities in 1946, and have grown exponentially since then. We now serve nearly 800 municipalities in every corner of Michigan — from cities and counties, to libraries, authorities, utilities and more.

Committed to Their Communities




Our retirees devoted their working lives to caring for their communities, and make incredible contributions to the places they call home today. Because 91% of our more than 28,000 retired MERS members stay in Michigan, they contribute nearly $500 million to the state’s economy each year. That’s money that stays in the communities and businesses, and shows what kind of impact MERS members continue to make.
