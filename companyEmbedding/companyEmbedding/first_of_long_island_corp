(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following is management's discussion and analysis of The First of Long Island Corporation's financial condition and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements. The Corporation's financial condition and operating results principally reflect those of its wholly-owned subsidiary, The First National Bank of Long Island, and subsidiaries wholly-owned by the Bank, either directly or indirectly, FNY Service Corp., The First of Long Island REIT, Inc. and The First of Long Island Agency, Inc. The consolidated entity is referred to as the Corporation and the Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Bank. Although the Bank's primary service area is currently Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island, it does have two commercial banking branches in Manhattan, three full service branches in Queens and one in Brooklyn. Expansion of the Bank's branch distribution system, particularly in the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, is an ongoing initiative.  Overview  Net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2017 were $9.1 million and $.38, respectively, representing increases over the same period last year of 18.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Dividends per share increased 7.7%, from $.13 for the first three months of 2016 to $.14 for the current three-month period. Returns on average assets (ROA) and average equity (ROE) for the first three months of 2017 were 1.02% and 11.75%, respectively, versus .97% and 11.94%, respectively, for the same period last year. Book value per share increased from $12.90 at year-end 2016 to $13.24 at the close of the current quarter. The credit quality of the Bank's loan and securities portfolios remains excellent and the mortgage pipeline at quarter-end was strong at $154 million.  Analysis of First Quarter Earnings. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $9.1 million, an increase of $1.4 million, or 18.9%, over the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in net interest income of $3.0 million, or 14.3%, and noninterest income of $366,000, partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses of $535,000, noninterest expense of $583,000 and income tax expense of $761,000.  The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by growth in average interest-earning assets of $401.9 million, or 13.1%. Average interest-earning assets grew due to increases in the average balances of loans and securities. The growth in loans and securities was funded by growth in the average balances of noninterest-bearing checking deposits, interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and stockholders' equity. Net interest margin was 2.92% for the first quarter of 2017, essentially unchanged as compared to 2.93% for the first quarter of 2016.  The $366,000 increase in noninterest income is primarily attributable to increases in cash value accretion on bank-owned life insurance, service charges on deposit accounts, securities gains, Investment Management Division income and real estate tax refunds.  The $535,000 increase in the provision for loan losses is largely due to more loan growth in the current quarter. Loans grew $129.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $61.0 million in the same quarter last year. The impact of loan growth on the provision in each quarter was partially offset by improved economic conditions and, in the first quarter of 2016, a reduction in historical loss rates.  The $583,000 increase in noninterest expense is primarily attributable to increases in salaries, employee benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, and legal and consulting expense, partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense and computer and telecommunications expense.  The $761,000 increase in income tax expense is mainly attributable to higher pre-tax earnings in the current quarter and an increase in the effective tax rate from 21.9% in the 2016 quarter to 24.2% in the current quarter.  Asset Quality. The Bank's allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased 3 basis points from 1.18% at year-end 2016 to 1.15% at March 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to adjustments to certain qualitative factors to reflect improved economic conditions. The provision for loan losses was $788,000 and $253,000 in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amount of the provision in each quarter was driven mainly by loan growth, offset by improved economic conditions and, in the first quarter of 2016, further offset by a reduction in the historical loss component of the allowance for loan losses.  The credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio remains excellent. Nonaccrual loans amounted to $2.1 million, or .08% of total loans outstanding at March 31, 2017, compared to $2.6 million, or .10%, at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to two loans accounted for as troubled debt restructurings being returned to accrual status based on the demonstrated ability of the borrowers to service their debt. Troubled debt restructurings amounted to $1.5 million, or .05% of total loans outstanding at March 31, 2017. Of the troubled debt restructurings, $1.2 million are performing in accordance with their modified terms and $286,000 are nonaccrual and included in the aforementioned amount of nonaccrual loans. Loans past due 30 through 89 days amounted to $1.9 million, or .07% of total loans outstanding, at March 31, 2017, compared to $1.1 million, or .04%, at December 31, 2016. Management does not believe that the increase in loans past due 30 to 89 days is indicative of a deterioration in the overall credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio.  The credit quality of the Bank's securities portfolio also remains excellent. The Bank's mortgage securities are backed by mortgages underwritten on conventional terms, with 58% of these securities being full faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government and the balance being obligations of U.S. government sponsored entities. The remainder of the Bank's securities portfolio principally consists of high quality, general obligation municipal securities rated AA or better by major rating agencies. In selecting municipal securities for purchase, the Bank uses credit agency ratings for screening purposes only and then performs its own credit analysis. On an ongoing basis, the Bank periodically assesses the credit strength of the municipal securities in its portfolio and makes decisions to hold or sell based on such assessments.  Key Strategic Initiatives. Key strategic initiatives will continue to include loan and deposit growth through effective relationship management, targeted solicitation efforts, new product offerings and continued expansion of the Bank's branch distribution system on Long Island and in the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. With respect to loan growth, the Bank will continue to prudently manage concentration risk and further develop its broker and correspondent relationships. Small business credit scored loans, equipment finance loans and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, along with the Bank's traditional commercial and industrial loan products, will be originated to diversify the Bank's loan portfolio and help mitigate the impact of the low rate environment on the Bank's earnings.  The Bank's growing branch distribution system currently consists of 47 branches in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island and the boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Bank expects to open four more branches in the next 12 months and continues to evaluate sites for further branch expansion. One of the new branches will be in East Setauket, Long Island, one will be in Queens and two will be in Brooklyn. In addition to loan and deposit growth, management is also focused on growing noninterest income from existing and potential new sources, which may include the development or acquisition of fee-based businesses.  Challenges We Face. Since December 2015, there have been three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds target rate to its current level of .75% to 1%. Further increases are expected and could exert upward pressure on non-maturity deposit rates. At the same time, intermediate and long-term interest rates remain relatively low resulting in suboptimal investing and lending rates. Additionally, there is significant price competition for loans in the Bank's marketplace and little room for the Bank to reduce its deposit rates. These factors will make it difficult to improve net interest margin and could result in a decline in net interest margin from its current level and inhibit earnings growth for the foreseeable future.  The banking industry continues to be faced with new and complex regulatory requirements and enhanced supervisory oversight. The President has indicated that regulatory relief and tax reform will be forthcoming, but the timing, magnitude and impact of any such changes are yet to be determined. In the current environment, banking regulators are increasingly concerned about, among other things, growth, commercial real estate concentrations, underwriting of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, capital levels, cyber security and, as of late, predatory sales practices. Regulatory requirements and enhanced oversight are exerting downward pressure on revenues and upward pressure on required capital levels and the cost of doing business.  Net Interest Income  Average Balance Sheet; Interest Rates and Interest Differential. The following table sets forth the average daily balances for each major category of assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as well as the amounts and average rates earned or paid on each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The average balances of investment securities include unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and the average balances of loans include nonaccrual loans.

Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Corporation's investment in tax-exempt loans and investment securities had been made in loans and investment securities subject to Federal income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. The tax-equivalent amount of $1.00 of nontaxable income was $1.54 in each period presented using the statutory Federal income tax rate of 35%.  Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table sets forth the effect of changes in volumes, rates and rate/volume on tax-equivalent interest income, interest expense and net interest income.   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Versus 2016 Increase (decrease) due to changes in: Rate/ Net Volume Rate Volume (1) Change (in thousands) Interest Income: Interest-earning bank balances $ (6 ) $ 22 $ (2 ) $ 14 Investment securities: Taxable 322 (19 ) (5 ) 298 Nontaxable (14 ) (26 ) - (40 ) Loans 3,028 32 45 3,105 Total interest income 3,330 9 38 3,377 Interest Expense: Savings, NOW & money market deposits 157 319 82 558 Time deposits (127 ) (77 ) 17 (187 ) Short-term borrowings 135 60 70 265 Long-term debt (22 ) (192 ) 10 (204 ) Total interest expense 143 110 179 432 Increase (decrease) in net interest income $ 3,187 $ (101 ) $ (141 ) $ 2,945  (1) Represents the change not solely attributable to change in rate or change in volume but a combination of these two factors. The rate/volume variance could be allocated between the volume and rate variances shown in the table based on the absolute value of each to the total for both.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis for the first quarter of 2017 was $25.5 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 13.1%, over $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in average interest-earning assets of $401.9 million, or 13.1%, partially offset by a one basis point decline in net interest margin from 2.93% to 2.92%.  The increase in average interest-earning assets is comprised of growth in the average balances of loans of $349.9 million, or 15.4%, and securities of $55.9 million, or 7.2%. Although most of the loan growth occurred in mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans also grew with an increase in average outstandings of $30.8 million, or 32.5%. The Bank's continued ability to grow loans is attributable to a variety of factors including, among others, competitive pricing, targeted solicitation efforts, the introduction of new loan products, advertising campaigns and broker and correspondent relationships for both residential and commercial mortgages.  The growth in loans and securities was funded by growth in the average balances of noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $62.0 million, or 8.0%, interest-bearing deposits of $216.2 million, or 13.1%, short-term borrowings of $102.0 million and stockholders' equity of $56.4 million. A substantial contributor to the growth in deposits was new branch openings. The Bank's ongoing ability to grow deposits is attributable to, among other things, continued expansion of the Bank's branch distribution system, targeted solicitation of local commercial businesses and municipalities, new and expanded lending relationships, new small business checking and loan products and the expansion of merchant sales relationships. In addition, management believes that the Bank's positive reputation in its marketplace has contributed to both loan and deposit growth. A substantial contributor to the growth in stockholders' equity was $35.3 million of capital raised in an underwritten public offering completed in May 2016.  Net interest margin of 2.92% for the first quarter of 2017 remained essentially unchanged as compared to 2.93% in the same quarter last year. The current level of net interest margin reflects the low interest rate environment that has persisted for an extended period of time. On a going forward basis, if available yields for loans and securities, prepayment penalties and the cost of deposits and borrowings remain at current levels, net interest margin is not expected to meaningfully decline. This expectation is based on the fact that significant portions of the Bank's mortgage loan and securities portfolios were originated or purchased in a low rate environment at yields similar to those currently available.  Noninterest Income  Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, Investment Management Division income, gains or losses on sales of securities, and all other items of income, other than interest, resulting from the business activities of the Corporation.  Noninterest income increased $366,000, or 20.9%, when comparing the first quarter of 2017 to the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in cash value accretion on bank-owned life insurance of $116,000, service charges on deposit accounts of $69,000, securities gains of $57,000, Investment Management Division income of $46,000 and real estate tax refunds of $33,000. Cash value accretion increased because of purchases of bank-owned life insurance during the first quarter of 2017 with an initial cash value of $25.0 million. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts is due to higher deposit account overdraft and maintenance and activity charges. Securities gains of $57,000 in the current quarter resulted from a deleveraging transaction involving the sale of approximately $40.0 million of available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities and use of the proceeds to pay down short-term borrowings. If interest rates remain at current levels, this transaction will reduce the Bank's net interest income on a going forward basis. However, it will improve the Bank's Tier 1 leverage capital ratio and, more importantly, reduces the Bank's exposure to increasing interest rates. Investment Management Division income increased because of increases in assets under management resulting principally from improved equity market conditions.  Noninterest Expense  Noninterest expense is comprised of salaries, employee benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense and other operating expenses incurred in supporting the various business activities of the Corporation.  Noninterest expense increased $583,000, or 4.7%, when comparing the first quarter of 2017 to the same period last year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in salaries of $346,000, or 6.2%, employee benefits expense of $140,000, or 8.4%, occupancy and equipment expense of $144,000, or 6.1%, and legal and consulting expense of $92,000. The impact of these items was partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense of $118,000 and computer and telecommunications expense of $93,000. The increase in salaries is primarily due to new branch openings, additions to staff in the back office, higher stock-based compensation expense and normal annual salary adjustments. The increase in employee benefits expense resulted primarily from increases in incentive compensation cost of $99,000 and group health insurance expense of $71,000, partially offset by a decrease in retirement plan expense of $59,000. The increase in health insurance expense resulted from increases in staff count and the rates being charged by insurance carriers. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense includes the operating costs of new branches and increases in maintenance and repairs expense and the cost of servicing equipment. The decrease in FDIC insurance expense is attributable to lower FDIC assessment rates effective July 1, 2016 partially offset by a growth-related increase in the assessment base. The decrease in computer and telecommunications expense reflects cost savings arising from renegotiation of the Bank's data processing contract in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the elimination of phone lines due to the installation of a new phone system.  Income Taxes  Income tax expense as a percentage of book income ("effective tax rate") was 24.2% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 21.9% for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decline in the percentage of pre-tax book income represented by income on tax-exempt securities and state taxes in additional jurisdictions. The impact of these items on the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit derived from the first quarter of 2017 purchase of bank-owned life insurance and the additional tax benefit derived in the current quarter from vesting and exercise of stock awards. The $761,000 increase in income tax expense in the first quarter of 2017 reflects the aforementioned increase in the effective tax rate and higher pre-tax earnings in the current quarter.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Corporation adopted ASU 2016-09 "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 were adjusted retroactively to reflect the adoption of the ASU effective as of January 1, 2016. The ASU increased net income in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 through credits to income tax expense by $285,000 and $205,000, respectively.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts. Our determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. In the event that management's estimate needs to be adjusted based on, among other things, additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances, such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact, either positively or negatively, the Bank's results of operations.  The Bank's Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Committee ("ALLL Committee"), which is a management committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer, meets on a quarterly basis and is responsible for determining the allowance for loan losses after considering, among other things, the results of credit reviews performed by the Bank's independent loan review consultants and the Bank's credit department. In addition, and in consultation with the Bank's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer, the ALLL Committee is responsible for implementing and maintaining accounting policies and procedures surrounding the calculation of the required allowance. The Board Loan Committee reviews and approves the Bank's Loan Policy at least once each calendar year. The Bank's allowance for loan losses is reviewed and ratified by the Board Loan Committee on a quarterly basis and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency whose safety and soundness examination includes a determination as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to absorb probable incurred losses.  The first step in determining the allowance for loan losses is to identify loans in the Bank's portfolio that are individually deemed to be impaired and then measure impairment losses based on either the fair value of collateral or the discounted value of expected future cash flows. In estimating the fair value of real estate collateral, management utilizes appraisals or evaluations adjusted for costs to dispose and a distressed sale adjustment, if needed. Estimating the fair value of collateral other than real estate is also subjective in nature and sometimes requires difficult and complex judgments. Determining expected future cash flows can be more subjective than determining fair values. Expected future cash flows could differ significantly, both in timing and amount, from the cash flows actually received over the loan's remaining life.  In addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired, management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed. The Bank's highest average annualized loss experience over periods of 24, 36, 48 or 60 months is generally the starting point in determining its allowance for loan losses for each pool of loans. Management believes that this approach appropriately reflects losses from the current economic cycle and those incurred losses in the Bank's loan portfolio. However, since future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past, on a quarterly basis management adjusts its historical loss experience to reflect current conditions. In doing so, management considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the weight to assign to each in estimating losses. The factors include, among others: (1) delinquencies, (2) economic conditions as judged by things such as median home prices and commercial vacancy rates in the Bank's service area and national and local unemployment levels, (3) trends in the nature and volume of loans, (4) concentrations of credit, (5) changes in lending policies and procedures, (6) experience, ability and depth of lending staff, (7) changes in the quality of the loan review function, (8) environmental risks, and (9) loan risk ratings. Substantially all of the Bank's allowance for loan losses allocable to pools of loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment results from these . . .
