History[edit]
The company was founded as Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1971 for $38 million ($224,721,446 today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to FabergÃ© in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from Unilever in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed (NASDAQ:Â RDEN). The company is located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami.[4] The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.
Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were Vendela Kirsebom during the 1980s, Amber Valletta to the mid-1990s, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. On 2 December 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.[5]
Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to Britney Spears fragrances, as well as the Hilary Duff, Elizabeth Taylor and Mariah Carey fragrance collections. Juicy Couture's "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift's fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.[6]
In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on Pinterest, Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.
Sale to Revlon[edit]
In June 2016, US cosmetics company Revlon announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (Â£611m). When the deal is concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.[7]
On September 7, 2016, Revlon completed its acquisition of Elizabeth Arden. At the time of the merger, it was expected that E. Scott Beattie would join Revlon, Inc.âs board of directors as non-executive Vice Chairman and serve as a senior advisor to Fabian Garcia, Revlonâs President and Chief Executive Officer.[8] [9]
On November 3, 2016, Revlonâs Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Ardenâs former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlonâs Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.[10]

What's Aging Your Skin?
What's Aging Your Skin?

					80% of all skin aging is due to environmental aggressors such as UV rays, pollution, and smoke.1

New PREVAGEÂ® City Smart protects skin against pollution, sun, and visible aging.


 1 Skin aging and its treatment, L.Bauman, Journal of Pathology, 2007





 


Key Ingredients






   Anti-Pollution Shield Technology
(Protects Against Pollution)
  

   Forms an invisible protective barrier to help prevent harmful toxins and pollution particles from penetrating skin. 100% Mineral Broad Spectrum SPF 50 sunscreen (micronized Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide) filters out UVA and UVB rays.
  






Anti-Pollution Complex
(Defends Against Damage)
  

A potent, patent-pending Anti-Pollution Complex is comprised of an exclusive antioxidant blend of Idebenone, Green Tea, Thiotaine, Ferulic Acid and L-Carnosine to neutralize free radical damage caused by pollution and UV exposure, including both oxygen-based and nitrogen-based free radicals.
  






   DNA Enzyme Complexâ¢
(Strengthens Skin)
  

Helps protect against free radical damage and supports skinâs natural repair process against oxidative stress. Skinâs elastin and collagen matrix are protected and its natural recovery process is strengthened resulting in healthier, more resilient skin.
  








SUPER/SMART Steps






PREVAGEÂ® City Smart sheer, hydrating multi-active skin defender is an essential last step in daily skincare regimens, regardless of age, skin type or concern.



1

Boost:  Apply 1 pump of Elizabeth Arden SUPERSTART Skin Renewal Booster onto a cleansed face. Avoid eye area. Use as the first step in your skincare regimen.
  


2

Correct: Apply PREVAGEÂ® Anti-aging Daily Serum over Elizabeth Arden SUPERSTART Skin Renewal Booster.
  


3

Protect: Apply PREVAGEÂ® City Smart evenly to face and neck as the last step in your morning skincare routine regardless of age, skin type, or concern. (If additional hydration is needed you can add your favorite PREVAGEÂ® moisturizer under City Smart).




PREVAGEÂ® City Smart contains a universal tint and optical diffusers that works well with all skin tones and makeup products. Non-comedogenic, paraben free, and dermatologist tested.

        Bring back the old spf50 sunscreen with the brush
Find it drying and makes my face look pale and chalky.  I use most of the prevage line and used to love the old spf50 lotion.

        Good product
This is a nice sunscreen that provides good broad spectrum protection and antioxidants, and it does't leave a weird finish. However, this makes the skin a little bit dry after a couple of hours when used in seasons like this. Plus I'd like it better if there are no or less fragrance. It makes skin feel warm when you apply it, which is not quite comforting.

        Did not meet my expectations
I really wanted to be wowed by this foundation because I use and love all Prevage skincare. It's possible I chose the wrong shade, 2, for my fairskin. Should have gone with 1. It makes me look orange. Even so, the coverage and feel wasn't impressive. Sorry! I still love Prevage skincare!!

        Disappointed
Purchased shade 2 of this foundation, the overwhelming look of this shade was orange. Was very disappointed in this Elizabeth Arden foundation. Will not purchase again.

        Perfect
This foundation has the best consistency, I use less than one pump to cover my entire face. It is very uniformed and leaves no visible signs that I am wearing any make up which is amazing. I have dry skin and I find it very moisturizing but not greasy. The finish is natural, smooth and radiant. I am using the number 7 and has a slight yellow undertone which I like for my olive skin tone. Love the spf 30 as well. It really is a next generation of make up!

        Only buy this if you have a dry complexion
I bought this foundation since I like the Prevage line of skin care.  The Prevage foundation is way too greasy.   I do still use the other Prevage products, but for foundation I am using another line.

        Great finish
Love the finish of this foundation. I am mid-50, combination skin--and it's not too tacky or shiny like some other treatment foundations. If it's humid out I add a bit of finishing powder--if not, I add my bronzer and blush and go. I like yellow based tones and this works well (I use the 4)

        Excellent foundation
This is my second purchase of this makeup. It has a light texture with light to moderate coverage. I think it keeps my skin hydrated during the day.  My skin is very light so I especially like that the tone of the color is natural-no hints if yellow.

Product was recommended by my dermatologist because of the SPF30. I am 66 years old with fine lines and tendency towards dry skin. I really like this foundation because it goes on smoothly, it is light, and matches my skin tone. It is easy to layer over dark spots without looking heavy. Also, it stays on all day!

History[edit]
The company was founded as Red Door salon on Fifth Avenue in 1910. Arden's company was then sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 1971 for $38 million ($224,721,446 today). Eli Lilly and Company sold Arden to FabergÃ© in 1987 for $657 million. Arden's cosmetics company continues to trade today, and was bought from Unilever in 2003 by FFI for $225 million, a New York company. They changed the company's name to Elizabeth Arden, which is publicly listed (NASDAQ:Â RDEN). The company is located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami.[4] The company continues to offer color coordinated make-up sets, as well as an extensive line of skin care products and treatments.
Past 'faces' of Elizabeth Arden were Vendela Kirsebom during the 1980s, Amber Valletta to the mid-1990s, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. On 2 December 2014, the company announced Karlina Caune would be the new face of the brand.[5]
Since Arden's death, some of the company's focus has shifted to the development of a number of fragrance lines. The company's signature fragrance is called "Red Door" named after their day spas which are called "Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons". Other fragrance within their own line are "Fifth Avenue", "Green Tea", "Provocative Woman", "Mediterranean", "Pretty", "Red Door Aura" and their newest, "Untold". The company also holds the license to Britney Spears fragrances, as well as the Hilary Duff, Elizabeth Taylor and Mariah Carey fragrance collections. Juicy Couture's "Viva la Juicy", "Couture Couture", and "Peace, Love & Juicy Couture", and Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift's fragrance collections are recent additions to the Arden portfolio.[6]
In July 2012, as the first ever "Pin to give it" campaign on Pinterest, Elizabeth Arden aims to supply women with cancer with confidence boosting make up products. This is a part of the "Look Good Feel Better" campaign which the company has been a part of for several years. The LGFB is dedicated to help cancer patients to manage the appearance related side effects of cancer treatment.
Sale to Revlon[edit]
In June 2016, US cosmetics company Revlon announced its intention to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. for US $870 million (Â£611m). When the deal is concluded, the company was expected to have annual gross sales of US $3 billion.[7]
On September 7, 2016, Revlon completed its acquisition of Elizabeth Arden. At the time of the merger, it was expected that E. Scott Beattie would join Revlon, Inc.âs board of directors as non-executive Vice Chairman and serve as a senior advisor to Fabian Garcia, Revlonâs President and Chief Executive Officer.[8] [9]
On November 3, 2016, Revlonâs Board of Directors appointed E. Scott Beattie, Elizabeth Ardenâs former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a member of Revlonâs Board of Directors in the capacity of non-executive Vice-Chairman.[10]

        Did not meet my expectations
I really wanted to be wowed by this foundation because I use and love all Prevage skincare. It's possible I chose the wrong shade, 2, for my fairskin. Should have gone with 1. It makes me look orange. Even so, the coverage and feel wasn't impressive. Sorry! I still love Prevage skincare!!

        Perfect
This foundation has the best consistency, I use less than one pump to cover my entire face. It is very uniformed and leaves no visible signs that I am wearing any make up which is amazing. I have dry skin and I find it very moisturizing but not greasy. The finish is natural, smooth and radiant. I am using the number 7 and has a slight yellow undertone which I like for my olive skin tone. Love the spf 30 as well. It really is a next generation of make up!

        Only buy this if you have a dry complexion
I bought this foundation since I like the Prevage line of skin care.  The Prevage foundation is way too greasy.   I do still use the other Prevage products, but for foundation I am using another line.

        Great finish
Love the finish of this foundation. I am mid-50, combination skin--and it's not too tacky or shiny like some other treatment foundations. If it's humid out I add a bit of finishing powder--if not, I add my bronzer and blush and go. I like yellow based tones and this works well (I use the 4)

        Excellent foundation
This is my second purchase of this makeup. It has a light texture with light to moderate coverage. I think it keeps my skin hydrated during the day.  My skin is very light so I especially like that the tone of the color is natural-no hints if yellow.

Product was recommended by my dermatologist because of the SPF30. I am 66 years old with fine lines and tendency towards dry skin. I really like this foundation because it goes on smoothly, it is light, and matches my skin tone. It is easy to layer over dark spots without looking heavy. Also, it stays on all day!

        Good product
This is a nice sunscreen that provides good broad spectrum protection and antioxidants, and it does't leave a weird finish. However, this makes the skin a little bit dry after a couple of hours when used in seasons like this. Plus I'd like it better if there are no or less fragrance. It makes skin feel warm when you apply it, which is not quite comforting.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
