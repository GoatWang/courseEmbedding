 AS FEATURED IN




 











Weight-training
                                                    athletes who supplemented their diets with
                                                    a newly discovered fatty acid isomer
experienced a 600% increase in lean
                                                    muscle growth and a 9-fold increase in biceps girth over
                                                    placebo.




BREAKING — 
                                        A new dietary supplement containing a
                                        pair
of specialized fatty acid "growth factors"
                                              is the hottest thing going
                                              in amateur athletics —
                                              but not without controversy.
Critics say
                                              the compounds — cis-9, tr11
                                              conjugated linioleic acid and phosphatidylserine (Ps) provided in the
                                              controversial, new supplement C9T11
                                           2.0 — gives
                                           athletes an "unfair advantage" and their use should be prohibited
                                           by
                                           athletes.
Proponents argue research shows the compounds
                                              to be both safe and effective and is a natural muscle-building
                                              alternative, similar to creatine
                                              monohydrate.
One thing people on both sides can agree on is the
                                              controversial new supplement seems to really work. According to a recent study published in the
                                              journal Medicine & Science
                                              & Sports and Medicine, novice weight trainers who
                                              took these compounds for
                                              seven weeks experienced a 600%
                                              increase in lean muscle growth, including
                                              a 9-fold
                                              increase in biceps
                                              girth.
Another study published in the same
                                              journal found that in
                                              weight-training athletes, these growth-factors increased overall muscle strength
                                              by 202
                                              percent within just 6 weeks — with
                                              zero side
                                              effects.
Fair Game or
                                              Unfair
                                              Advantage?






Athletes who supplemented with these natural
                                                          'growth factors' for seven weeks packed on six
                                                          times more muscle and added 30 pounds to their
                                                          bench press compared to the guys given a
                                                          placebo.


Word-of-mouth
                                        marketing has led to C9T11
                                           2.0 rivaling creatine and pre-workout nitric oxide
                                           (NO2) supplements as the most popular natural
                                           performance-enhancers in amateur athletic locker
                                           rooms.
However, critics 
                                              say these
                                              compounds too closely mimic the effects of anabolic steroids and that
                                              their use should be prohibited by athletes. 
To be sure,
                                              steroids, similar to these compounds, work in
                                              large part by minimizing the catabolic effects of cortisol,
                                              allowing for greater amino acid uptake, nitrogen retention, and
                                              protein
                                              synthesis.
Many sports scientists,
                                              however, say the compounds are a viable alternative to dangerous
                                              performance-enhancing drugs. They point to the fact that these
                                              compounds are isolated from natural food sources, and are therefore
                                              no different, ethically, from high-carbohydrate food mixes for
                                              aerobic athletes. Besides, they say research has shown them
                                              to be medically safe and that we should emphasize that the
                                              alternative to these natural compounds is
                                              steroids.
'Unreal' Size and Strength
                                              Gains 
Whether or not using C9T11
                                           2.0 constitutes "cheating" doesn't concern the thousands
                                           of athletes and fitness buffs using
                                           it.
Jason Massey, a 37-year-old amateur
                                              athlete from Fort Collins, Colorado, writes: "The gains in
                                              muscle size and strength I'm seeing with C9T11
                                           2.0 is
                                           UNREAL. 
"With other supplements
                                              I've used, I thought I could 'kinda sorta' notice a difference, but
                                              this is ridiculous. C9T11 2.0 is the first supplement I've used where I could
                                              actually notice vivid gains in muscle size. After my first 30-day
                                              'cycle,' I've packed on over 25 pounds of muscle, and my strength has
                                              literally gone through the
                                              roof."
Another believer is
                                              Dave Kenny, a
                                              37-year-old journalist from Columbia, Missouri. "After 28 days, I was down from a
                                              size 36 waist to a 34, I could actually see my abs for the first time
                                              in over 10 years, my bench press increased by 20
                                              pounds, and I began to see a start difference in the
                                              definition in my arms, legs, and
                                              chest."

Does C9T11
                                           2.0 deliver "steroid-like"
                                           muscle-growth effects? Well, judge for yourself. While the
                                           supplement is not expected to hit national retail shelves
                                           until mid-June 2017, a limited number of bottles are available

                                           a sugary McDonald's softdrink. What's more, each

About


If you’re reading this letter, chances are you’re an athlete of some kind – whether it’s professional, a rising collegiate star, amateur competitor, a weekend warrior or just someone who takes their health and fitness seriously. You also know and understand the importance that sports nutrition plays in your body’s muscle and strength development, overall performance and even recovery. The problem is, the sports nutrition industry is virtually unregulated and wrought with companies that prey on young athletes’ ignorance. They over-hype and under-deliver on label claims and effectiveness. Unfortunately, many athletes don’t realize this until it is too late, and their health, reputation, career – or all three – are jeopardized.
In 2003 when I played for the Indianapolis Colts, I became frustrated with the supplements I was taking. They were not helping my performance as promised in advertisements – in fact, they were hindering my performance, and even caused injuries on the football field. After my strength coach advised me to stop taking over-marketed supplements that over-promised and under-delivered, I found my mission in life. This is why I started MusclePharm®.
As a professional athlete myself, nothing stands in the way of my career. This is why I have invested millions of dollars and amassed a team of the world’s most respected scientists, physicians, researchers, trainers and athletes. Our quest is to create a superior line of sports nutrition products that are safe, free of banned substances, and formulated, tested and certified under the most stringent conditions in the marketplace today. I’m proud to say that at MusclePharm®, we don’t just make and sell the products, we live the lifestyle. MusclePharm® is our daily routine. We train in the state-of-the-art performance facility I built to test and perfect our products using real-world scenarios. We see MusclePharm® results in our own lives along with those of the professional athletes that use and endorse our products.
But don’t take my word for it. As with any product you put in your body, I invite and encourage you to truly examine our products, our ingredients and processes, then incorporate the correct ones into your fitness routine. Then it’s time to Fuel The Athlete Inside®!

History[edit]
MusclePharm Corporation was incorporated on August 4, 2006. On February 18, 2010, the company acquired Muscle Pharm, LLC, and as a result, MusclePharm became a wholly owned subsidiary.[1]
In May 2012, Marina Ventures sought to force MusclePharm's sale of 21 million shares of common stock. Inter-Mountain Capital sued MusclePharm for alleged failure to sell, seeking damages of $4 million.[2] In the same month, John's Lone Star Distribution alleged in a suit that MusclePharm entered into illegal price discrimination contracts with a Lone Star competitor with the intention of removing Lone Star from the market.[3]
In 2011, Environmental Research Center (ERC) filed a notice of intent to start litigation against over 200 nutrition and supplement companies, including MusclePharm, alleging violations of California Proposition 65.[4] In February 2012, ThermoLife claimed in a lawsuit that MusclePharm infringed ThermoLife's patent on amino acid compounds including creatine nitrate.[5]
In September 2011, it was reported that MusclePharm's executive vice president, Leonard Armenta, had resigned after accusations from the MMA fighter Quinton "Rampage" Jackson that there was a spy in his camp in the lead up to UFC 135. Jackson accused his opponent Jon Jones of having a spy at his training camp in Denver, Colorado, in the buildup to the bout. In an interview with ESPN's SportsCenter, Jackson said MusclePharm released an employee named "Leonard" and accused him of acting as a spy for Jones.[6][7]
In March 2012, NSF International notified the public that a MusclePharm product improperly bore the "NSF Certified for Sport" mark.[8] In December 2013, NSF launched a lawsuit against MusclePharm[9] and declared that MusclePharm is not authorized to use any NSF certification marks, to claim that any of its products are certified by NSF or to claim that they have been manufactured in an NSF GMP certified or registered facility.[10]
In September 2012, The Tawnsaura Group sued MusclePharm for patent infringement.[11]
In October 2012, MusclePharm discontinued use of BEAST Sports' trademarks including "Beast" and "Beast Mode" after MusclePharm’s unauthorized use.[12]
MusclePharm Corp. announced plans to buy back $5 million of all common stock in December 2013.[13] In 2013 MusclePharm Corporation completed a $12 million registered direct offering of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.[14] The Frost Group, LLC, headed by Miami entrepreneur, billionaire, Phillip Frost, was the lead investor in the offering and elected to increase its previously announced investment in the offering to a total of $2.9 million.[15]
In January 2014, MusclePharm acquired BioZone Laboratories, which included its facility in Richmond, California.[16] This acquisition included BioZone's QuSomes, HyperSorb and EquaSome technologies, as well as various lines of products including the Arnold Schwarzenegger series in 2013. The acquisition was finalized in late 2013. MusclePharm sold Biozone to Valencia, CA-based Flavor Producers for $9.8 million in April 2016.[17]
In September 2014, MusclePharm entered into a revolving credit facility with Amarillo National Bank for $8 million.[18] By the end of 2014, MusclePharm reported a $67 million net revenue earning. Net sales in the fourth-quarter alone were in excess of $32 million.[19] In August 2015 it was reported that MusclePharm had earned $50.5 Million by the end of second quarter 2015, which is an 8% increase compared to 2014.[20] They also announced their plans to restructure in order to save an excess of $20 million on an annual basis starting in 2016.[21]
MusclePharm was sued in a California federal court in late January 2015, for misleading customers about the amount of protein their products contain.[22]

History[edit]
MusclePharm Corporation was incorporated on August 4, 2006. On February 18, 2010, the company acquired Muscle Pharm, LLC, and as a result, MusclePharm became a wholly owned subsidiary.[1]
In May 2012, Marina Ventures sought to force MusclePharm's sale of 21 million shares of common stock. Inter-Mountain Capital sued MusclePharm for alleged failure to sell, seeking damages of $4 million.[2] In the same month, John's Lone Star Distribution alleged in a suit that MusclePharm entered into illegal price discrimination contracts with a Lone Star competitor with the intention of removing Lone Star from the market.[3]
In 2011, Environmental Research Center (ERC) filed a notice of intent to start litigation against over 200 nutrition and supplement companies, including MusclePharm, alleging violations of California Proposition 65.[4] In February 2012, ThermoLife claimed in a lawsuit that MusclePharm infringed ThermoLife's patent on amino acid compounds including creatine nitrate.[5]
In September 2011, it was reported that MusclePharm's executive vice president, Leonard Armenta, had resigned after accusations from the MMA fighter Quinton "Rampage" Jackson that there was a spy in his camp in the lead up to UFC 135. Jackson accused his opponent Jon Jones of having a spy at his training camp in Denver, Colorado, in the buildup to the bout. In an interview with ESPN's SportsCenter, Jackson said MusclePharm released an employee named "Leonard" and accused him of acting as a spy for Jones.[6][7]
In March 2012, NSF International notified the public that a MusclePharm product improperly bore the "NSF Certified for Sport" mark.[8] In December 2013, NSF launched a lawsuit against MusclePharm[9] and declared that MusclePharm is not authorized to use any NSF certification marks, to claim that any of its products are certified by NSF or to claim that they have been manufactured in an NSF GMP certified or registered facility.[10]
In September 2012, The Tawnsaura Group sued MusclePharm for patent infringement.[11]
In October 2012, MusclePharm discontinued use of BEAST Sports' trademarks including "Beast" and "Beast Mode" after MusclePharm’s unauthorized use.[12]
MusclePharm Corp. announced plans to buy back $5 million of all common stock in December 2013.[13] In 2013 MusclePharm Corporation completed a $12 million registered direct offering of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.[14] The Frost Group, LLC, headed by Miami entrepreneur, billionaire, Phillip Frost, was the lead investor in the offering and elected to increase its previously announced investment in the offering to a total of $2.9 million.[15]
In January 2014, MusclePharm acquired BioZone Laboratories, which included its facility in Richmond, California.[16] This acquisition included BioZone's QuSomes, HyperSorb and EquaSome technologies, as well as various lines of products including the Arnold Schwarzenegger series in 2013. The acquisition was finalized in late 2013. MusclePharm sold Biozone to Valencia, CA-based Flavor Producers for $9.8 million in April 2016.[17]
In September 2014, MusclePharm entered into a revolving credit facility with Amarillo National Bank for $8 million.[18] By the end of 2014, MusclePharm reported a $67 million net revenue earning. Net sales in the fourth-quarter alone were in excess of $32 million.[19] In August 2015 it was reported that MusclePharm had earned $50.5 Million by the end of second quarter 2015, which is an 8% increase compared to 2014.[20] They also announced their plans to restructure in order to save an excess of $20 million on an annual basis starting in 2016.[21]
MusclePharm was sued in a California federal court in late January 2015, for misleading customers about the amount of protein their products contain.[22]
In March 2015, MusclePharm signed a development and manufacturing supply agreement with Capstone Nutrition and purchased a 20% interest in Capstone's parent company (INI).[23]
In September 2015, MusclePharm was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with infractions related to a number of accounting and disclosure violations. The investigation found that MusclePharm failed to report, or grossly misrepresented, approximately $500,000 in benefits paid to three current or former executives and chairmen The SEC also discovered that MusclePharm issued stock without a registration statement when it entered into numerous transactions with third parties that agreed in exchange for company shares to pay cash to MusclePharm vendors. MusclePharm owed vendors approximately $1.1 million in outstanding invoices and was short on funds to pay them. [24]

In September 2015, MusclePharm was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with infractions related to a number of accounting and disclosure violations. The investigation found that MusclePharm failed to report, or grossly misrepresented, approximately $500,000 in benefits paid to three current or former executives and chairmen The SEC also discovered that MusclePharm issued stock without a registration statement when it entered into numerous transactions with third parties that agreed in exchange for company shares to pay cash to MusclePharm vendors.

History[edit]
MusclePharm Corporation was incorporated on August 4, 2006. On February 18, 2010, the company acquired Muscle Pharm, LLC, and as a result, MusclePharm became a wholly owned subsidiary.[1]
In May 2012, Marina Ventures sought to force MusclePharm's sale of 21 million shares of common stock. Inter-Mountain Capital sued MusclePharm for alleged failure to sell, seeking damages of $4 million.[2] In the same month, John's Lone Star Distribution alleged in a suit that MusclePharm entered into illegal price discrimination contracts with a Lone Star competitor with the intention of removing Lone Star from the market.[3]
In 2011, Environmental Research Center (ERC) filed a notice of intent to start litigation against over 200 nutrition and supplement companies, including MusclePharm, alleging violations of California Proposition 65.[4] In February 2012, ThermoLife claimed in a lawsuit that MusclePharm infringed ThermoLife's patent on amino acid compounds including creatine nitrate.[5]
In September 2011, it was reported that MusclePharm's executive vice president, Leonard Armenta, had resigned after accusations from the MMA fighter Quinton "Rampage" Jackson that there was a spy in his camp in the lead up to UFC 135. Jackson accused his opponent Jon Jones of having a spy at his training camp in Denver, Colorado, in the buildup to the bout. In an interview with ESPN's SportsCenter, Jackson said MusclePharm released an employee named "Leonard" and accused him of acting as a spy for Jones.[6][7]
In March 2012, NSF International notified the public that a MusclePharm product improperly bore the "NSF Certified for Sport" mark.[8] In December 2013, NSF launched a lawsuit against MusclePharm[9] and declared that MusclePharm is not authorized to use any NSF certification marks, to claim that any of its products are certified by NSF or to claim that they have been manufactured in an NSF GMP certified or registered facility.[10]
In September 2012, The Tawnsaura Group sued MusclePharm for patent infringement.[11]
In October 2012, MusclePharm discontinued use of BEAST Sports' trademarks including "Beast" and "Beast Mode" after MusclePharm’s unauthorized use.[12]
MusclePharm Corp. announced plans to buy back $5 million of all common stock in December 2013.[13] In 2013 MusclePharm Corporation completed a $12 million registered direct offering of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.[14] The Frost Group, LLC, headed by Miami entrepreneur, billionaire, Phillip Frost, was the lead investor in the offering and elected to increase its previously announced investment in the offering to a total of $2.9 million.[15]

History[edit]
MusclePharm Corporation was incorporated on August 4, 2006. On February 18, 2010, the company acquired Muscle Pharm, LLC, and as a result, MusclePharm became a wholly owned subsidiary.[1]
In May 2012, Marina Ventures sought to force MusclePharm's sale of 21 million shares of common stock. Inter-Mountain Capital sued MusclePharm for alleged failure to sell, seeking damages of $4 million.[2] In the same month, John's Lone Star Distribution alleged in a suit that MusclePharm entered into illegal price discrimination contracts with a Lone Star competitor with the intention of removing Lone Star from the market.[3]
In 2011, Environmental Research Center (ERC) filed a notice of intent to start litigation against over 200 nutrition and supplement companies, including MusclePharm, alleging violations of California Proposition 65.[4] In February 2012, ThermoLife claimed in a lawsuit that MusclePharm infringed ThermoLife's patent on amino acid compounds including creatine nitrate.[5]

Weight-training
                                                    athletes who supplemented their diets with
                                                    a newly discovered fatty acid isomer
experienced a 600% increase in lean
                                                    muscle growth and a 9-fold increase in biceps girth over
                                                    placebo.




BREAKING — 
                                        A new dietary supplement containing a
                                        pair
of specialized fatty acid "growth factors"
                                              is the hottest thing going
                                              in amateur athletics —
                                              but not without controversy.
Critics say
                                              the compounds — cis-9, tr11
                                              conjugated linioleic acid and phosphatidylserine (Ps) provided in the
                                              controversial, new supplement C9T11
                                           2.0 — gives
                                           athletes an "unfair advantage" and their use should be prohibited
                                           by
                                           athletes.
Proponents argue research shows the compounds
                                              to be both safe and effective and is a natural muscle-building
                                              alternative, similar to creatine
                                              monohydrate.
One thing people on both sides can agree on is the
                                              controversial new supplement seems to really work. According to a recent study published in the
                                              journal Medicine & Science
                                              & Sports and Medicine, novice weight trainers who
                                              took these compounds for
                                              seven weeks experienced a 600%
                                              increase in lean muscle growth, including
                                              a 9-fold
                                              increase in biceps
                                              girth.
Another study published in the same
                                              journal found that in
                                              weight-training athletes, these growth-factors increased overall muscle strength
                                              by 202
                                              percent within just 6 weeks — with
                                              zero side
                                              effects.
Fair Game or
                                              Unfair
                                              Advantage?






Athletes who supplemented with these natural
                                                          'growth factors' for seven weeks packed on six
                                                          times more muscle and added 30 pounds to their
                                                          bench press compared to the guys given a
                                                          placebo.


Word-of-mouth
                                        marketing has led to C9T11
                                           2.0 rivaling creatine and pre-workout nitric oxide
                                           (NO2) supplements as the most popular natural
                                           performance-enhancers in amateur athletic locker
                                           rooms.
However, critics 
                                              say these
                                              compounds too closely mimic the effects of anabolic steroids and that
                                              their use should be prohibited by athletes. 
To be sure,
                                              steroids, similar to these compounds, work in
                                              large part by minimizing the catabolic effects of cortisol,
                                              allowing for greater amino acid uptake, nitrogen retention, and
                                              protein
                                              synthesis.
Many sports scientists,
                                              however, say the compounds are a viable alternative to dangerous
                                              performance-enhancing drugs. They point to the fact that these
                                              compounds are isolated from natural food sources, and are therefore
                                              no different, ethically, from high-carbohydrate food mixes for
                                              aerobic athletes. Besides, they say research has shown them
                                              to be medically safe and that we should emphasize that the
                                              alternative to these natural compounds is
                                              steroids.
'Unreal' Size and Strength
                                              Gains 
Whether or not using C9T11
                                           2.0 constitutes "cheating" doesn't concern the thousands
                                           of athletes and fitness buffs using
                                           it.
Jason Massey, a 37-year-old amateur
                                              athlete from Fort Collins, Colorado, writes: "The gains in
                                              muscle size and strength I'm seeing with C9T11
                                           2.0 is
                                           UNREAL. 
"With other supplements
                                              I've used, I thought I could 'kinda sorta' notice a difference, but
                                              this is ridiculous. C9T11 2.0 is the first supplement I've used where I could
                                              actually notice vivid gains in muscle size. After my first 30-day
                                              'cycle,' I've packed on over 25 pounds of muscle, and my strength has
                                              literally gone through the
                                              roof."
Another believer is
                                              Dave Kenny, a
                                              37-year-old journalist from Columbia, Missouri. "After 28 days, I was down from a
                                              size 36 waist to a 34, I could actually see my abs for the first time
                                              in over 10 years, my bench press increased by 20
                                              pounds, and I began to see a start difference in the
                                              definition in my arms, legs, and

Does C9T11
                                           2.0 deliver "steroid-like"
                                           muscle-growth effects? Well, judge for yourself. While the

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
