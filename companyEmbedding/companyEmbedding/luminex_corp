MAGNETIC SEPARATORS







Specially designed for use with MagPlex® xMAP® assays, use these separators to separate a single reaction tube or a whole plate of beads from solution during wash steps








When handling MagPlex® Microspheres, it will often be necessary to separate the magnetic beads from solution. To make these wash steps as easy as possible, Luminex offers two magnetic separators: Magnetic Plate Separator and the Magnetic Tube Separator.

xMAP® ANTIBODY COUPLING KIT







Everything you need to couple your capture antibody of interest to MagPlex® microspheres








The xMAP® Antibody Coupling Kit,1,2 or “AbC” kit, is a reagent kit that contains everything a researcher needs to couple an antibody to MagPlex® Microspheres. Similar to an ELISA plate, MagPlex Microspheres can be used as the substrate on which immunoassays can be performed. Unlike a traditional ELISA, however, this assay method requires much less antibody, sample, and time; with equal or better sensitivity and dynamic range.3




Product DetailsWorkflowOrderingResourcesSupport





This kit is limited to antibody coupling and is NOT intended to be a comprehensive assay development kit.
This kit is specifically designed for coupling antibodies to MagPlex microspheres. Please visit the Resources section of the website to learn about coupling nucleic acids, antibodies, and other proteins to both MicroPlex® and MagPlex microspheres.

SeroMAP™ MICROSPHERES







Designed specifically for serological applications, these non-magnetic microspheres can reduce non-specific binding in serology assays








SeroMAP™ Microspheres
SeroMAP™ Microspheres1 are a special formulation of MicroPlex® Microspheres, which have been optimized to reduce non-specific binding in serology assays. Similar to MicroPlex Microspheres, these beads are carboxylated polystyrene microparticles that have been color coded into 100 spectrally distinct sets, or “regions.” Each of these regions can be quickly distinguished by an xMAP® instrument,1 which allows the interrogation of up to 100 different analytes from one single sample.

					Full Description



Luminex Corporation, incorporated on June 19, 1998, develops, manufactures and sells biological testing technologies with applications throughout the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. The Company's products are focused on the molecular diagnostic testing market, which includes human genetics, personalized medicine and infectious disease segments. The Company has a range of instruments using its xMAP technology, which includes its LUMINEX 100/200 systems offer 100-plex testing; the Company's FLEXMAP 3D system is its high-throughput, 500-plex testing system, and its MAGPIX system provides 50-plex testing using imaging rather than flow cytometry. By using its xMAP technology, the end users are able to generate multiple simultaneous results per sample. The Company primarily serves the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and life sciences industries by marketing products, including its testing equipment and assays, to a range of testing laboratories.The Company's xMAP technology is an open architecture, multiplexing technology that combines existing biological testing techniques with illumination, digital signal processing, detection and software. With its technology, discrete assays are performed on the surface of color-coded microspheres. These microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), detectors, charge-coupled device imaging and high-speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the assay and measure the individual assay results. xMAP technology performs approximately 500 distinct assays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample. xMAP can perform multiple types of assays, including enzymatic, genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform. xMAP technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels. Panels can be modified to include new assays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets. xMAP technology has an ability to analyze both proteins and nucleic acids. This allows customers to utilize a single platform to evaluate samples across biological parameters and generate a complete assessment of these samples. Its xMAP technology is used within various segments of the life sciences industry, which includes the fields of drug discovery and development, and for clinical diagnostics, bio-defense, food safety and biomedical research.The Company's xTAG technology consists of several components, including multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or target identification primers, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) Tags, xMAP microspheres and data analysis software. xTAG technology permits the development of molecular diagnostic assays for clinical use by hospital and reference laboratories. xTAG technology is applied, in particular, to human genetic assays, pharmacogenetic assays and infectious disease assays. Its MultiCode technology is based upon an assay chemistry that is a flexible platform for both real-time PCR and multiplex PCR-based applications. MultiCode-based PCR assays are used for the detection of infectious diseases and genetic-based conditions.The Company's products include instruments, including the Luminex LX 100/200 Systems, which are compact analyzers that integrate fluidics, optics and digital signal processing to perform simultaneously in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample. By combining semiconductor lasers with digital signal processors and microcontrollers, these systems perform rapid, multi-analyte profiles under the control of a Windows-based personal computer and its software; The FLEXMAP 3D system is intended for use as a general laboratory instrument in markets, including but not limited to, life science research and diagnostics. This device can simultaneously measure over 500 analytes from a single sample. Like its Luminex LX 100/200 Systems, the FLEXMAP 3D system combines semiconductor lasers with digital signal processors and microcontrollers and these systems perform rapid, multi-analyte profiles under the control of a Windows-based personal computer and its software; The MAGPIX system is a multiplexing analyzer capable of performing qualitative and quantitative analysis of proteins and nucleic acids in a range of sample matrices. As of December 31, 2016, this system can perform up to 50 tests in a single reaction volume. MAGPIX uses LEDs and a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging system, rather than the lasers and detection mechanisms used in its flow cytometry-based instruments, and the Company's ARIES system automates and integrates extraction of nucleic acid from a clinical sample, performs real-time PCR, and detects multiple signals generated by target specific probes. The ARIES system is used with specific assays to measure multiple analytes indicative of infectious disease. The ARIES system uses internal barcode scanning and other features to minimize operator errors. Its two independent modules each support from 1 to 6 cassettes, allowing both STAT and Batch testing. The ARIES system can run both In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) and MultiCode Analyte Specific Reagents (ASRs) simultaneously with a common Universal Assay Protocol.As of December 31, 2016, the Company's Consumables include its xMAP systems, which use polystyrene microspheres that are approximately 5.6 microns in diameter. It dyes the microspheres in sets with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve over 100 distinct color sets. Each microsphere can carry the reagents of an enzymatic, genetic or immunologic assay. MagPlex Microspheres feature super-paramagnetic properties and runs automated xMAP-based assays. It dyes the microspheres in sets with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve approximately 500 distinct color sets. These microspheres can be moved or held in place by a magnetic field. xTAG Microspheres are dyed microspheres that are linked to a set of over 100 nucleic acid capture sequences providing a universal array for DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) work. They are designed for conducting genotyping and other nucleic acid-based experiments in the life sciences, pharmaceutical and clinical diagnostic markets. The xTAG microspheres may be used by customers to develop laboratory developed test (LDT) assays and are the chemistry used for the Luminex xTAG assays. SeroMAP Microspheres are designed for specific protein based serological applications. Calibration and Control Microspheres are microspheres of known fluorescent light intensities, which are used to calibrate the settings for the classification and reporter channel for the Luminex systems. Control microspheres are microspheres that are used to verify the calibration and optical integrity for both the classification and reporter channels for the various systems. ARIES Cassettes are self-contained assay consumables designed to run a fully automated, sample to answer molecular assay on the ARIES system. The cassettes make use of injection-molded parts, as well as MultiCode and other reagents, to perform automated extraction, purification, elution, amplification and testing of nucleic acid testing from a range of sample types.The Company's software includes xPONENT software, which is included in all of its xMAP instruments. The software suite incorporates various features, including security; integration capabilities that allow customers to transmit and receive data from laboratory information systems/laboratory information management system (LIS/LIMS); integration with the automated sample preparation systems; the ability to run magnetic bead applications, and touch-screen. xPONENT is sold on Luminex 100, 200, FLEXMAP 3D, and MAGPIX systems and is available as an upgrade to the existing Luminex systems in the marketplace. The Company's assay product families include Respiratory Viral Family of products, including xTAG RVP, xTAG RVP FAST and NxTAG RPP. These IVD products enable its laboratory end users to identify the causative agent for respiratory infections, a cause of illness and mortality globally, for physicians and their patients. Gastrointestinal Pathogen Detection Family includes the xTAG Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel assay that enables laboratory end users to identify the pathogens causing infectious gastroenteritis, which is a cause of morbidity and mortality globally. MultiCode Assays and Products Family includes its Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) 1 and 2 Assay, as well as a number of analyte specific reagents and other products. These products are designed to detect infectious agents in clinical samples using its MultiCode RTx real-time PCR chemistry. ARIES Assays and Products Family include its FDA-cleared ARIES HSV 1 and 2 Assay, as well as other ARIES assays in development. Cystic Fibrosis Family includes IVD assays for cystic fibrosis (CF) genotyping. As of December 31, 2016, the xTAG CF kits screen for 23 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene in addition to a range of other CF mutations, found in the ethnically diverse North American and European populations. These kits are typically used for screening newborns and for diagnosing adult carriers of the CF gene. Pharmacogenetics Product Family includes assays used to determine the drug metabolism status of individuals for specific medications. All products include genotyping of genes encoding cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes. Its products in this category are the FDA-cleared CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 assays used for identifying patients with variants that affect the metabolism and efficacy of some pharmaceutical compounds.
