Ken Runnels has served as Executive Vice President of Operations since December 2007. His current responsibilities include overseeing all of the Dry, Dedicated and Linehaul operations. Ken began his career with Swift Transportation in 1983 as a log auditor, and over the next few years was quickly promoted through various operations positions and was promoted to Terminal Manager in March of 1989. Since 1983 Ken has held a myriad of positions, including Terminal Manager at several locations, Regional Vice President, and Vice President of Fleet Operations. With the exception of a brief period from July 2006 to November 2007, Ken has spent his transportation career with Swift. Ken helped grow Swift from a 140 truck operation in 1983 to our current truck count of 18,000.
