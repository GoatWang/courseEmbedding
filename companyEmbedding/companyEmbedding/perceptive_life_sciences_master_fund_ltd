      Dear Members of the Board of Directors:
    

      As reported in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (the “SEC”), Tang Capital Partners, LP and its affiliates 
      (“Tang Capital”) and Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. and its 
      affiliates (“Perceptive”) are the two largest shareholders of Penwest 
      Pharmaceuticals Co. (“Penwest” or the “Company”) and together own 40% of 
      the Company’s outstanding common stock.
    

      We write to express serious concerns about the current direction of 
      Penwest in the hope that you will take action before it becomes too late 
      and we are forced to pursue other measures. Specifically, for the 
      reasons explained below, we ask that you stop wasting corporate assets 
      and substantially wind down the Company’s operations so that we, the 
      shareholders, may realize the full value of the Opana ER royalty income 
      stream. We also ask that you confirm that our January 12, 2009 notice 
      that we intend to nominate 3 persons for election to the Board of 
      Directors at the 2009 annual meeting complies with Penwest’s advanced 
      notice bylaw provisions. We request that you take these actions no later 
      than March 10, 2009.
    

Penwest’s One Principal Asset


      Penwest has one principal asset: its royalty earned on the sale of Opana 
      ER by licensee Endo Pharmaceuticals (“Endo”). As you know, Opana ER was 
      launched by Endo in 2006, and had net sales in 2008 of approximately 
      $140 million-$145 million, up approximately 63-70% year-over-year. Net 
      of the royalty holiday and development cost recoupments, Penwest will 
      earn royalties at an effective rate of approximately 11-12% in 2009 and 
      21-23% in 2010, resulting in royalty income of approximately $19 
      million-$25 million this year and $45 million-$55 million next year, 
      depending on sales growth.
    

      As you also know, the duration for which this income stream will survive 
      is uncertain. Endo and Penwest recently entered into a settlement 
      agreement with Actavis South Atlantic LLC (“Actavis”) that will enable 
      Actavis to launch a generic version of Opana ER on or after July 15, 
      2011, or earlier under certain circumstances. Litigation with the other 
      first-to-file generic challenger, Impax Laboratories, Inc., is pending, 
      and the results of that litigation remain uncertain.
    

      Importantly, whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about the ultimate 
      sustainability and value of this income stream, our position on what is 
      the best course of action for shareholders does not change. To put this 
      in simple terms, whether one has $100 or $200 in one’s pocket, it is 
      equally unadvisable to waste $100.
    

      To be clear, this income stream is substantially passive and requires 
      negligible resources from Penwest. According to Penwest’s licensing 
      agreement with Endo dated April 2, 2002 and amended January 7, 2007 and 
      July 14, 2008, Penwest must supply Endo sufficient quantities of 
      formulated TIMERx (the extended release technology for Opana ER), the 
      fully-burdened cost of which is reimbursed by Endo. Furthermore, at the 
      option of Penwest, a contract manufacturer may be used to produce the 
      required supply of TIMERx, also at Endo’s cost.
    

      In terms of Penwest’s balance sheet, we estimate that there is only $6 
      million-$8 million of net cash left as of December 31, 2008 after last 
      year’s spending, based on figures provided in the Company’s December 
      2008 corporate presentation (the “Corporate Presentation”). This 
      includes an estimated $16 million-$18 million in cash and cash 
      equivalents, offset by $10 million in secured debt due over the next 21 
      months. Cash spend in 2008 was $30 million-$32 million, or approximately 
      60% of the Company’s current market capitalization, according to the 
      Corporate Presentation.
    

A0001 – Not Worthy of Continued Investment


      We understand that substantially all of the Company’s development 
      efforts are focused on A0001 for the potential treatment of several 
      Orphan diseases collectively referred to as mitochondrial diseases. The 
      Company recently announced that it has begun a Phase 1b clinical trial 
      of A0001, in which safety will be evaluated in healthy volunteers. The 
      Company also announced that it has initiated long-term animal toxicology 
      studies. If A0001’s safety is demonstrated, Penwest would next conduct a 
      Phase 2a trial evaluating the effect of short-term treatment of A0001 on 
      biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with mitochondrial 
      respiratory chain disease in the second half of 2009. We understand that 
      success in these studies then would be followed by Phase 2b or Phase 3 
      studies, which could commence in the second half of 2010 and potentially 
      be completed in the 2012 time frame. According to the Corporate 
      Presentation, the Phase 2a biomarker study, if successful, would 
      demonstrate proof-of-concept and serve as a “value creation point” for 
      Penwest.
    

      As participants in the biopharmaceutical industry, you do not need to be 
      reminded by us how risky and capital intensive drug development is, or 
      how only an estimated 11% of compounds in Phase 1 clinical trials make 
      it to market.1 Nor should you need to be told that the 
      capital markets have all but shut down for early-stage biopharmaceutical 
      companies and that preserving cash is of utmost importance in these 
      unprecedented economic times. We thought it might be helpful, however, 
      to discuss the program-specific reasons why we believe that the 
      development of A0001 faces even greater-than-usual challenges.
    


Vitamin E? Rights to A0001 were acquired through a July 
        16, 2007 licensing agreement with privately-owned Edison 
        Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Edison”). Under this agreement, Penwest has 
        paid Edison $7.5 million, including a $1.0 million upfront payment, a 
        $1.0 million loan to Edison that Penwest immediately wrote off through 
        an impairment charge for its full value, and $5.5 million in research 
        funding over the past 18 months. While management has told us that it 
        is not prepared to disclose the chemical identity of A0001, publicly 
        available information would seem to indicate that it is 
        alpha-tocopheryl quinone2, which is a chemical name for 
        vitamin E.3 Because alpha-tocopheryl quinone qualifies as a 
        dietary supplement under FDA regulations4, it at any time 
        could be made commercially available by dietary supplement 
        manufacturers through nutritional health stores and websites. 
        Furthermore, the intellectual property position for A0001 is tenuous 
        at best: (a) there is no composition-of-matter patent covering 
        alpha-tocopheryl quinone; (b) Penwest/Edison has no issued U.S. patent 
        with any claims covering even the use of alpha-tocopheryl quinone; and 
        (c) a competitor, Santhera Pharmaceuticals (“Santhera”), has a U.S. 
        patent that issued more than 8 years ago that claims the use of a 
        class of molecules encompassing alpha-tocopheryl quinone for the 
        treatment of mitochondrial diseases.5 To be commercially 
        viable as a potential treatment for an Orphan disease affecting only a 
        few thousand individuals, A0001 would need to achieve and sustain 
        reimbursement and market acceptance at a very high price point. We do 
        not see how this would be possible in light of the facts discussed 
        above.
      

If Santhera succeeds, Penwest will be many years behind the 
        competition. As you know, Santhera is developing idebenone, a 
        compound that Penwest indicates is chemically similar to A0001, for 
        mitochondrial diseases. Santhera announced that it achieved full 
        recruitment of its U.S. and European pivotal Phase 3 trials in October 
        2008 and December 2008, respectively, and that, if the outcome of its 
        U.S. trial is positive in the middle of this year, it would be in a 
        position to make regulatory filings in 2009. As one benchmark of time, 
        idebenone completed Phase 1 trials fully 4 years ago and Phase 3 
        results are still forthcoming. While one can always hope to be faster 
        than others, Penwest will have to contend with the countervailing 
        headwind that, if idebenone is successful, developing A0001 would 
        likely be more, not less, challenging because: (a) it would be more 
        difficult to enroll patients into a trial of an investigational agent 
        if a proven agent is available; and (b) it is likely that the FDA 
        would require a pivotal trial that compares A0001 to that proven 
        agent, which would require far more patients than a placebo-controlled 
        trial. From a commercial standpoint, while it is often argued that 
        being second or third to market can be sufficiently lucrative, we 
        believe that this is not the case for an Orphan condition affecting 
        only a few thousand patients.
      

If Santhera fails, there will be no basis to continue. 
        Since A0001 is chemically similar to idebenone and both A0001 and 
        idebenone are chemical analogues of the same prototype molecule 
        (coenzyme Q), there would be little rationale to continue A0001’s 
        development if idebenone does not demonstrate efficacy in its Phase 3 
        trials.
      

A time line for proof of concept that will not be met.
As mentioned above, Penwest hopes to generate proof-of-concept 
        through its planned Phase 2a biomarker study in the second half of 
        2009, and that this, in turn, will serve as a “value creation point” 
        for the Company. Unfortunately, existing data indicate that this will 
        not be the case. There are no validated surrogate end points for 
        mitochondrial diseases. A validated surrogate end point is a 
        laboratory measurement, or “biomarker,” that, through a clinical trial 
        of a pharmacologic agent, has been shown to predict a change in 
        clinical outcome. The premise is that, if this link is established, 
        then future clinical trials need only show an effect on the surrogate 
        end point, rather than the clinical outcome itself, to establish proof 
        of concept. In point of fact, not only are there no validated 
        surrogate end points for mitochondrial diseases, but the class of 
        biomarkers that Penwest is putting forward as candidate surrogate end 
        points for this class of diseases, namely markers of oxidative stress, 
        have actually been invalidated by Santhera’s clinical 
        experience with idebenone. Specifically, in an October 2007 review of 
        Santhera’s Phase 2 clinical trial of idebenone in Freidrich’s Ataxia 
        (“FA”), a mitochondrial disease, in the peer-reviewed journal Lancet 
        Neurology, it was reported that idebenone failed to show an effect 
        on any markers of oxidative stress despite some trends 
        suggesting potential activity on clinical outcomes. The authors note:
      


“The exact mechanism of idebenone’s effect in FA is unclear. In 
      the absence of a detectable effect based on the hypothesized mechanism 
      (i.e., reduced oxidative stress), a non-specific effect of idebenone 
      cannot be excluded.” 6




          Hence, with biomarkers of oxidative stress rendered clinically 
          meaningless, Penwest will have to await clinical outcome data from 
          Phase 2b or 3 trials for proof of concept and, hence, “value 
          creation.” Such data, unfortunately, are many years and many tens of 
          millions of dollars away.
        



Where Is All of Our Money Going?


      We are concerned about the continued level of spend at Penwest and the 
      complete lack of value that this spend is creating.
    


2008: $30 million in, zero out. Based on the Corporate 
        Presentation, Penwest’s cash spend in 2008 was $30 million-$32 
        million, consisting of $12 million-$13 million for “programs” and $18 
        million-$19 million for “overhead.” These “programs” consisted of 
        nalbuphine ER, which failed in a Phase 2a trial, PW4153, which failed 
        in a Phase 1 trial, and A0001, discussed above. As for the “overhead,” 
        we are shocked by this dollar range. Mr. Tang has served on the boards 
        of several public companies and Tang Capital and Perceptive are 
        investors in many more. What are often termed “public company costs,” 
        which include director and officer insurance, audit costs, and certain 
        legal costs, typically approximate $1 million annually. So where did 
        the remaining $17 million-$18 million go? It did not go toward 
        supporting the receipt of the Opana ER royalty, since, as discussed 
        earlier, this is a passive income stream.
      

2009: A similar theme? In the Corporate 
        Presentation, Penwest has provided an outlook for 2009 that cash spend 
        will be in the range of $21 million-$22 million. This consists of $4 
        million for “programs,” which are down to one given last year’s 
        failure of nalbuphine ER and PW4153, and “overhead” of a remarkably 
        similar (and similarly shocking) $17 million-$18 million. If this is 
        truly overhead and, by its definition, cannot be tied to any activity 
        that is creating value for shareholders, we urge you to eliminate it 
        immediately. If, however, these dollars have been mischaracterized as 
        overhead and are, in fact, necessary to progress A0001, then they 
        would serve as further support that A0001 is a negative-return 
        proposition, and should be eliminated anyways.
      


Lottery Ticket Strategy?


      Based on the lack of rational explanation for the Company’s enthusiasm 
      behind A0001 and the remarkable magnitude of spending at the Company, 
      others have begun to speculate on what the strategy of the Company 
      actually is, and whether there are other motives, which are perhaps 
      diametrically opposed to that of creating shareholder value, afoot. As 
      one of the four equity research analysts who provide coverage on the 
      Company recently wrote:
    

“Lottery ticket strategy. Management continues to 
      manage for the pipedream (our opinion) that is referred to as A0001 (for 
      mitochondrial diseases). To run a whole company for a single 
      product that is not even beyond proof of concept is a profound 
      disservice to shareholders…The overhead is just too heavy to maintain 
      this expensive endeavor. Note that the PPCO management team has 
      very little impact on the true share price driver (the Opana ER pain 
      drug royalty stream - our opinion) beyond signing royalty checks (and 
      management should not be given credit for its marketing success, again 
      our opinion).


The Board represents who? Shareholders or management?
You decide. In November 2008, the Board implemented a 
      retention package that rewards management for a change of control (200% 
      of salary and highest bonus since at the Company). Jennifer Good 
      took control as CEO in June 2006, and the stock has fallen from the 
      $15-20/share range to currently under $2/share. Why compensate 
      this performance for a takeout that could be in the $5/share range? Shareholders 
      deserve a Board response to this question. Ironically, the 
      Company is getting rid of CFO Ben Palleiko, who is the one person we 
      would have chosen to keep.” 7


Management and Board Have Not Invested in Penwest Stock


      Tang Capital and Perceptive have invested more than $45 million of their 
      money in the stock of Penwest. Based on our review of SEC filings, the 
      current officers and directors have invested substantially zero 
      dollars in the Company’s stock since July 1, 2003, the date on which the 
      SEC began requiring electronic reporting of insider transactions. In 
      point of fact, over this time period, this group has actually realized 
      $2.2 million in profits through the sale of Penwest stock obtained 
      through the exercise of incentive and non-statutory stock options and 
      restricted stock grants. This is in addition to the more than 
      $6.5 million in cash compensation through salaries, bonuses and board 
      fees that this group has received during this time.
    

      While there is no legal requirement that management or board members 
      personally invest in any company that they run, we are concerned that 
      the lack of investment here may be unduly influencing the decisions 
      being made (or not being made) by Penwest’s officers and directors 
      because there is not a strong alignment of interests between these 
      individuals and Penwest’s shareholders.
    

A Win-Win Proposition


      If management and members of the Board are truly committed to A0001, we 
      would welcome the Company entering into a transaction with these 
      insiders whereby Penwest grants them or an entity they create rights to 
      A0001 and any follow-on compounds, free of charge, in return for the 
      spending reductions we are seeking. As owners of 40% of the Company’s 
      stock, we pledge to support such a transaction.
    

Our Final Plea that You Act Now


      We again implore the Board to act swiftly and decisively to preserve 
      shareholder value. If you are unwilling to do so by March 10, 2009, we 
      plan to take the following actions to protect our interests and the 
      interests of all shareholders.
    


Inspection of books and records. Pursuant to Washington 
        law, we plan to deliver to the Company’s Corporate Secretary a demand 
        to inspect the Company’s books and records so that we may better 
        understand your actions, or lack thereof, as Board members. In 
        particular, we will request, and expect to be provided with access to, 
        all corporate documentation, including all materials reviewed by each 
        of you as directors of the Company, related to, among other things:
      


      1. the licensing of the A0001 program from Edison;2. your decision 
      to continue developing A0001 despite its weak scientific foundation;3. 
      your decision to continue employing a workforce much larger than needed 
      to develop a single compound in Phase 1 trials;4. your failure to 
      take appropriate steps as fiduciaries to protect the Company’s remaining 
      value and return that value to shareholders; and5. the reasons for 
      and circumstances surrounding the recent departure of your Chief 
      Financial Officer.
    


Judicial confirmation of our Board nominations. On 
        January 12, 2009, we wrote a letter to Penwest’s Corporate Secretary 
        notifying you that we intend to nominate 3 persons for election to the 
        Board of Directors. In this letter, we requested that you confirm that 
        our notice complies with Penwest’s notice provisions in its bylaws. To 
        date, although 7 weeks have passed since the date of that request, you 
        have refused to provide the requested confirmation. We are, again, 
        requesting that you confirm, no later than March 10, 2009, that our 
        January 12, 2009 notice complies with Penwest’s bylaws, and that we, 
        therefore, will be permitted to make our nominations and submit votes 
        in favor of our nominees at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders. 
        Alternatively, if it is your opinion that our notice does not comply 
        with Penwest’s notice provisions, please identify all deficiencies in 
        our notice. If you do not respond, we will promptly seek judicial 
        enforcement of our rights in the Washington State courts.
      

Referendum vote. To publicly demonstrate in a highly 
        quantitative and rigorous manner how overwhelmingly Penwest’s 
        shareholders are in favor of the actions we are advocating, we intend 
        to notify the Company, in compliance with its bylaw provisions, of our 
        intention to bring to a vote of the shareholders at the 2009 annual 
        meeting a referendum on the future direction of the Company. 
        Specifically, we will ask shareholders whether they believe that 
        Penwest should take prompt and thoughtful action to preserve 
        shareholder value by immediately winding down substantially all of the 
        Company’s operations so that the full value of the Opana ER royalty 
        income stream will be retained by the Company.
      

Bylaw amendments. We plan to propose bylaw 
        amendments that will require the Board to be more responsive and 
        accountable to the wishes of its shareholders.
      

Legal action against the Company’s officers and directors. 
        In light of the facts set forth above, as well as information to be 
        obtained by way of our books and records request, we intend to 
        vigorously pursue all of our shareholder rights by way of litigation 
        against the officers and directors of the Company, including, but not 
        limited to, claims of breach of fiduciary duty.
      


Each of You Is Individually Accountable


      We have made many attempts to present our case to you, through letters 
      from Perceptive to you on November 21, 2008 and December 19, 2008, a 
      meeting with Jennifer Good, the Company’s President and Chief Executive 
      Officer, and Perceptive on December 4, 2008, a meeting with Ms. Good and 
      Tang Capital on January 9, 2009, a meeting with Paul Freiman, the 
      Company’s Chairman, and Tang Capital on February 2, 2009, and a meeting 
      with Mr. Freiman and Perceptive on February 18, 2009.
    

      Following these communications and interactions, we have received 
      nothing more than: (a) an indication by Mr. Freiman to Kevin Tang of 
      Tang Capital that he would be invited to present at the February Board 
      meeting, followed by no invitation actually being extended; (b) a 
      suggestion by Mr. Freiman to Joseph Edelman of Perceptive that he may 
      join the Board on the condition that the Tang Capital nominees withdraw; 
      and (c) an attempt by Mr. Freiman to persuade Mr. Edelman to consider 
      selling Perceptive’s Penwest stock at current market prices.
    

      We understand that you have decided to delegate the role of 
      communicating with us to Ms. Good and Mr. Freiman. Needless to say, we 
      are disappointed in your continued lack of response to our repeated 
      requests for action. We do not need to remind you that, as members of 
      the Board, each of you is individually responsible for exercising your 
      judgment as fiduciaries to the Company’s shareholders. This is not a 
      responsibility that can be delegated to management, nor abdicated by 
      relying on the efforts of certain directors. Any failure to properly 
      discharge your fiduciary duties is a failure for which each of you can 
      be held personally responsible.
    


Mr. Paul Freiman, as recently retired President and Chief 
        Executive Officer of Neurobiological Technologies, Inc., you told Mr. 
        Tang that you pushed for the immediate cessation of operations for the 
        benefit of shareholders following the failure of that company’s 
        investigational drug candidate. Should you not do the same here?
      

Ms. Jennifer Good, in your first role as President and Chief 
        Executive Officer of a public company, do you really want to pursue an 
        agenda that is not supported by your shareholders?
      

Dr. Christophe Bianchi, with your experience as Head of 
        Commercial Operations at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we ask that 
        you speak up about the high probability that, even if A0001 were to 
        survive the long development path that lies ahead of it, its 
        commercial viability would be questionable.
      

Dr. Peter Drake, as a veteran investment analyst who covered 
        biotechnology stocks for more than a decade and now manager of 
        Mayflower Partners, a health care investment fund, can you not 
        identify with the analysis we lay out in this letter and empathize 
        with the position that this management team has put us in?
      

Dr. David Meeker, with your experience running the world’s 
        largest business focused on Orphan diseases as President of the LSD 
        Therapeutics business unit of Genzyme Corporation, you are in a unique 
        position to explain to your colleagues how, in a world of scarce 
        resources, A0001 is not competitive with other programs being 
        developed for Orphan diseases.
      

Ms. Anne VanLent, as former Chief Financial Officer of Barrier 
        Therapeutics, Inc., you should have a keen appreciation for how a high 
        cash burn rate can destroy shareholder value, even in a company that 
        has successfully brought products to market.
      

Mr. Robert Hennessey, as former President and Chief Executive 
        Officer of Genome Therapeutics Corporation and a board member of its 
        successor, Oscient Pharmaceuticals Corporation, you too must be 
        acutely aware of the perils of a high cash burn rate, especially in 
        today’s economic environment.
      

Mr. James O’Shea, as former President and Chief Operating 
        Officer of Sepracor, where you focused for many years on maximizing 
        that company’s profit margin, are you not concerned about the amount 
        of cash being spent on overhead that is producing no value?
      

Dr. John Staniforth, as a co-inventor of the TIMERx technology 
        that enabled Opana ER to become the commercial success that it is, are 
        you not disappointed that all of the value that has been created by 
        this product is being wasted on high-risk R&D gambles with weak 
        scientific foundations?
      


      In closing, we implore you to consider the facts discussed above and to 
      rise to the task of taking the decisive actions outlined in this letter 
      required to preserve shareholder value. We look forward to your prompt 
      action.
    




            Sincerely,

Tang Capital Partners, LP And Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. Urge The Shareholders Of Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co. To Vote For Their Director Nominees






Business Wire




Jun 7, 2010 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  Our Directors and Nominees   We believe that our three nominees for election this year, together with Mr. Tang and Mr. Edelman, who you elected last year, possess the determination, experience and expertise to make the changes necessary to maximize value at Penwest.   Kevin Tang. Kevin Tang, who you elected last year, is the founder and manager of Tang Capital, an investment company focused on the biopharmaceutical industry with an established record of delivering superior returns to its investors. Since its inception on September 3, 2002 through May 28, 2010, Tang Capital has generated a total return, net of all fees and expenses, of 520%, for an annualized rate of return of 26%. Mr. Tang has nineteen years of experience evaluating biopharmaceutical companies in his current capacity as a portfolio manager and his prior capacity as a biotechnology analyst. He has considerable experience governing biopharmaceutical companies as a board member and currently is a director of A.P. Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: APPA) and Ardea Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: RDEA), which he co-founded in 2006.   Joseph Edelman. Joseph Edelman, who you elected last year, is the founder and manager of Perceptive, an investment company focused on the biopharmaceutical industry with an established record of delivering superior returns to its investors. Mr. Edelman has twenty years of experience evaluating biopharmaceutical companies in his current capacity as a portfolio manager and his prior capacity as a biotechnology analyst.   Roderick Wong, M.D. Roderick Wong, one of our nominees for election this year, is a seasoned investment professional with particular expertise in evaluating and investing in biopharmaceutical companies. In his capacity as Managing Member of RTW Investments, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager of the Davidson Kempner Healthcare Funds, and Healthcare Analyst at Sigma Capital Management, Dr. Wong has invested in more than 100 health care companies representing more than $1 billion in invested capital. Dr. Wong also serves as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at NYU Stern Business School, where he teaches an MBA course entitled Financial Analysis in Healthcare, and previously was a member of the biotechnology equity research team at Cowen & Company. Dr. Wong graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, received an MBA from Harvard Business School, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a BS in Economics from Duke University.   Saiid Zarrabian. Saiid Zarrabian, one of our nominees for election this year, is a seasoned executive with extensive operating experience in the life sciences industry. Importantly, he has been an effective manager of both growing and maturing companies. He has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Cyntellect, Inc., President and Chief Operating Officer of Senomyx, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNMX), Chief Operating Officer of Pharmacopeia, Inc., now Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: LGND), and President and Chief Operating Officer of Molecular Simulations, Inc. He also has experience governing life sciences companies as a board member and currently is a director of Ambit Biosciences Corporation, eMolecules, Inc., and Cyntellect, Inc.   John Lemkey. John Lemkey, one of our nominees for election this year, has extensive knowledge of financial and tax-related matters. As the Chief Financial Officer of Tang Capital, Mr. Lemkey manages an accounting, finance and administrative staff, performs financial and valuation analyses, reviews business plans, designs, negotiates and manages complex financial transactions and interacts with management and boards of directors of portfolio companies. Previously, he was an auditor for Ernst and Young LLP. Mr. Lemkey is a Certified Public Accountant in the state of California (inactive) and received his B.S. degree in Accounting from the University of Southern California.    Our Pledge to Make the Board Accountable to the Shareholders  A final word on corporate governance. It is our belief that it is a board’s duty to govern a company for the benefit of the company’s shareholders, not itself or the management team. The shareholders are, after all, the owners of a company, and the salaries and fees paid to board members and managers are paid by them. As we have discussed in the past, we believe that Penwest’s corporate governance is a disgrace, and that the Company’s policies and tactics – ranging from its staggered board to its establishment of a “poison pill” – have been borne out of an explicit desire by the Company’s legacy leadership to suppress shareholder input and avoid accountability. This has to change. If our nominees are elected, we pledge to recommend that the board eliminates the staggered board, eliminates the poison pill, and takes other actions necessary to make the board wholly accountable to the shareholders.

Tang Capital Partners, LP and Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. Issue Letter to Fellow Shareholders | Business Wire


























































Tang Capital Partners, LP and Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund 
      Ltd. Issue Letter to Fellow Shareholders






March 16, 2009 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tang Capital Partners, LP (“Tang Capital”) and Perceptive Life Sciences 
      Master Fund Ltd. (“Perceptive”) today announced that they have issued a 
      letter to fellow shareholders of Penwest Pharmaceuticals Co. (NASDAQ: 
      PPCO). The text of the letter follows.
    


Tang Capital Partners, LP4401 Eastgate MallSan 
      Diego, CA 92121


Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd.499 Park 
      Avenue, 25th FloorNew York, NY 10022


      March 16, 2009
    

      Dear Fellow Penwest Shareholder:
    

      Tang Capital Partners, LP and its affiliates (“Tang Capital”) and 
      Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund Ltd. and its affiliates 
      (“Perceptive”) are the two largest shareholders of Penwest 
      Pharmaceuticals Co. (“Penwest” or the “Company”) and together own 42% of 
      the Company’s outstanding common stock. We have some serious concerns 
      about the conduct of Penwest’s Board of Directors and will soon be 
      sending you proxy materials and asking for your support on a number of 
      matters at the 2009 Annual Meeting. Specifically, we will be seeking 
      your vote on: (a) the election of our three nominees to the Board of 
      Directors; (b) a referendum on the future direction of the Company; and 
      (c) bylaw amendments that will require the Board to be more responsive 
      and accountable to the wishes of Penwest’s shareholders. Having become 
      frustrated by the Board’s actions and obstructionist tactics over the 
      past several months, we are undertaking this proxy contest only as a 
      last resort.
    

Our Experience Evaluating and Governing Life Sciences Companies


      Tang Capital and Perceptive are both investment funds that focus 
      exclusively on the health care industry. The vast majority of both 
      funds’ investment activities involve small-capitalization, 
      pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies like Penwest. Tang Capital has 
      operated since 2002, and Perceptive has operated since 1999. Kevin Tang, 
      the Managing Director of Tang Capital’s general partner, has served as a 
      director of several life sciences companies and currently is a director 
      of A.P. Pharma, Inc. and Ardea Biosciences, Inc. From 1993 to 2001, 
      Mr. Tang held various positions at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, Inc., most 
      recently serving as Managing Director and head of the firm’s life 
      sciences research group. Prior to founding Perceptive, Joseph Edelman, 
      the Managing Member of its investment manager, was a Senior Analyst at 
      Paramount Capital from 1994 to 1999 and the Senior Biotechnology Analyst 
      at Prudential Securities from 1990 to 1994.
    

Our Interest Is Aligned with Yours


      First and foremost, we assure you that our interest is aligned with 
      yours. To state it plainly, we have one interest in mind, and that is to 
      maximize the price of Penwest’s stock so that we can maximize the return 
      on our investment. Like you, we have invested precious capital to obtain 
      our equity position. Penwest’s contention in its March 12, 2009 letter 
      to shareholders that Tang Capital’s interests are not aligned with yours 
      because its cost basis is low is absurd; Tang Capital and Perceptive 
      alike are interested in achieving the maximum value for their shares 
      going forward. Together, Tang Capital and Perceptive have invested more 
      than $45 million in the common stock of Penwest over a period of 
      approximately two years.
    

      By contrast, as outlined in our March 3, 2009 letter to Penwest’s Board 
      of Directors, the officers and directors of Penwest have invested 
      virtually nothing in Penwest’s stock since July 1, 2003. To make matters 
      worse, this group has actually realized $2.2 million in profits from the sale 
      of Penwest stock obtained through the exercise of incentive and 
      non-statutory stock options and restricted stock grants during this 
      period. All the while, this group continues to benefit from considerable 
      cash compensation from the Company, which has amounted to more than $6.5 
      million during this period. Thus, it appears that it is the interests of 
      the Board and management that are not aligned with yours.
    

Your Board’s Response to Our Last Plea for Action


      In our March 3, 2009 letter to Penwest’s Board, we asked that it stop 
      wasting corporate assets and substantially wind down the Company’s 
      operations so that the Company’s shareholders may realize the full value 
      of the Opana ER royalty income stream. We also asked that it confirm 
      that our January 12, 2009 notice that we intend to nominate three 
      persons for election to the Board of Directors at the 2009 Annual 
      Meeting complies with Penwest’s advanced notice bylaw provisions. 
      Penwest’s Board has chosen to do neither.
    

      Instead, as outlined in a March 12, 2009 press release and Form 8-K, 
      Penwest has reinstated a shareholder rights plan, or “poison pill,” to 
      prevent Tang Capital and Perceptive from acquiring more Penwest stock 
      and to prevent any other shareholder from acquiring more than 15% of 
      Penwest’s outstanding stock. Once again, instead of taking actions to 
      preserve shareholder value, Penwest’s Board is taking action to further 
      entrench itself against the wishes of its shareholders. Importantly, we 
      are not alone in our view that poison pills are not in the best 
      interests of shareholders. Major proxy advisory services, including 
      Glass Lewis & Co. and RiskMetrics Group, are squarely against them. In 
      its Proxy Paper Policy Guidelines for U.S. Companies, Glass Lewis states 
      that, “poison pill plans generally are not in the best interests of 
      shareholders.” In its 2008 Proxy Report on Penwest specifically, 
      RiskMetrics Group deemed the presence of the Company’s poison pill as a 
      negative governance factor.
    

      In its March 12, 2009 letter to shareholders, Penwest indicates that 
      Perceptive’s increase in ownership position in spring 2008 triggered 
      change-of-control limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue 
      Code that caused Penwest to lose significant net operating loss 
      carryforwards and R&D tax credits. You should know that Penwest, on 
      March 5, 2008 and again on March 20, 2008, twice amended its 
      then-existing poison pill specifically to allow Perceptive to increase 
      its ownership position ultimately to 21.9% of the Company’s outstanding 
      common stock. It is these amendments, which were recommended by 
      management and approved by the Board, that allowed Perceptive to 
      increase its position to a level that exceeded the threshold required to 
      trigger the change-of-control limitation. Management states that 
      “institutional investors like Perceptive must be aware of these tax 
      rules,” and in hindsight faults Perceptive for “destroying value” by 
      limiting Penwest’s tax assets. In fact, it is the Company’s management 
      and Board that, through the recommendation and approval of the poison 
      pill amendments, allowed this limitation to be triggered. Therefore, 
      they should be held solely responsible for the “value destruction.”
    

Insist that Your Board Lets the Shareholders Decide


      We believe that the majority of shareholders share our view that our 
      recommended actions are in their best interests. Penwest’s Board 
      apparently disagrees. In its March 12, 2009 letter to shareholders, 
      Penwest’s Board states that “many shareholders have told us that they 
      firmly believe these two shareholders do not represent their interests 
      and the Company should continue executing on its strategy for 2009.”
    

      As we outlined in our March 3, 2009 letter, we plan to find out the 
      truth. Specifically, we intend to bring to a vote of the shareholders at 
      the 2009 Annual Meeting a referendum on the future direction of the 
      Company. In this referendum, we will ask shareholders whether they 
      believe that Penwest should take prompt and thoughtful action to 
      preserve shareholder value by immediately winding down substantially all 
      of the Company’s operations so that the full value of the Opana ER 
      royalty income stream will be retained for the benefit of shareholders. 
      We believe that this referendum vote will demonstrate in a highly 
      quantitative and rigorous manner that the majority of Penwest’s 
      shareholders are in favor of the actions we are advocating.
    

      We herein ask our fellow Penwest shareholders to: (a) urge Penwest’s 
      Board to convene its 2009 Annual Meeting as soon as possible so that the 
      referendum vote can be taken; and (b) insist that Penwest’s Board honor 
      the results of this referendum vote by immediately taking the actions 
      requested should a majority of shareholders vote for them.
    

      With respect to this last point, you should know that adoption of our 
      proposals is not assured even in the case of an overwhelming vote in 
      their favor, and, therefore, your insistence that the Board honor the 
      wishes of shareholders is critical. This is because your company has a 
      classified, or “staggered,” board, which means that only a minority of 
      directors, in this case three of nine, stand for election each year. As 
      a result, even with a vote of an overwhelming majority of shareholders, 
      it is not possible to replace a majority of the Board and, therefore, 
      ensure a change in the Company’s direction, until the second of two 
      annual shareholder meetings. As this represents yet another mechanism 
      for management entrenchment and evasion of accountability, proxy 
      advisory firms universally frown on these provisions. In its Proxy Paper 
      Policy Guidelines for U.S. Companies, Glass Lewis & Co. states that, 
      “Glass Lewis favors the repeal of staggered boards and the annual 
      election of directors. We believe staggered boards are less accountable 
      to shareholders than boards that are elected annually. Furthermore, we 
      feel the annual election of directors encourages board members to focus 
      on shareholder interests.” In a similar vein, RiskMetric Group’s U.S. 
      Proxy Voting Manual states, “a classified board tips the balance of 
      power too much toward incumbent management at the price of potentially 
      ignoring shareholder interests.”
    

Background on Our Position


      Below, we summarize why we believe that the actions we are advocating 
      are in the best interests of shareholders. We also refer you to our 
      press release dated March 3, 2009 and the letter to the Penwest Board 
      enclosed therein for a more complete discussion of our position.
    

      Tang Capital and Perceptive continue to believe that there is 
      significant value in the royalty income stream on Opana ER that Penwest 
      receives from licensee Endo Pharmaceuticals (“Endo”). Opana ER had net 
      sales in 2008 of approximately $140 million-$145 million, up 
      approximately 63-70% year-over-year. Net of a royalty holiday and 
      development cost recoupments, Penwest, by our estimates, will earn 
      royalties at an effective rate of approximately 11-12% in 2009 and 
      21-23% in 2010, resulting in royalty income of approximately $19 
      million-$25 million this year and $45 million-$55 million next year, 
      depending on sales growth.
    

      To be clear, this income stream is substantially passive and requires 
      negligible resources from Penwest. According to Penwest’s licensing 
      agreement with Endo dated April 2, 2002 and amended January 7, 2007 and 
      July 14, 2008, Penwest must supply Endo sufficient quantities of 
      formulated TIMERx (the extended release technology for Opana ER), the 
      fully-burdened cost of which is reimbursed by Endo. Furthermore, at the 
      option of Penwest, a contract manufacturer may be used to produce the 
      required supply of TIMERx, also at Endo’s cost.
    

      We believe that this passive income stream, the capital from which could 
      eventually be distributed to shareholders, is instead being wasted on 
      “overhead” and A0001, a single drug candidate in early-stage development 
      that, in our view, is not worth developing. According to financial 
      guidance provided in its March 4, 2009 press release, Penwest is 
      planning for 2009 revenues (almost all of which are derived from the 
      Opana ER royalty) of $22 million-$24 million, 2009 operating expenses of 
      $21 million-$24 million, and a 2009 net loss of $1 million-$3 million. 
      Based on this guidance and figures provided in Penwest’s December 2008 
      corporate presentation, we estimate that Penwest is planning for 2009 
      cash spend of $14 million-$16 million on “overhead” and $4 million on 
      “programs” associated with A0001.
    

Questions You May Wish to Ask Management


      In evaluating the credibility of management and the reasonableness of 
      its business plan, we urge you to seek answers to the following 
      questions. Most of these questions were raised in our March 3, 2009 
      letter, and yet management has chosen not to respond to any of them.
    


Why is it a good use of shareholder capital for a company with a 
        single compound in active development that is only in Phase 1 to spend 
        $14 million-$16 million on “overhead?” There simply is no 
        rational explanation.
      

If the officers and directors are so convinced that the 
        shareholder capital they continue to spend will generate a positive 
        return, why has none of them invested his/her own capital in Penwest’s 
        stock over the past five years? Actions speak louder than 
        words.
      

Why does management continue to say that the identity of A0001 
        has not been disclosed when it is on a public website? Penwest 
        management, as recently as March 4, 2009 on Penwest’s quarterly 
        conference call, continues to state that the chemical identity of 
        A0001 “has not been made public…but it is not a vitamin E derivative.” 
        As indicated in our March 3, 2009 letter, according to the FDA’s “List 
        of Orphan Designations and Approvals” (http://www.fda.gov/orphan/designat/list.xls, 
        row 181), A0001 is alpha-tocopheryl quinone. Is management unaware 
        that the identity of the only drug candidate Penwest has in active 
        development is indeed disclosed? Or, worse, has management been 
        purposely attempting to hide A0001’s identity?
      

How would a vitamin derivative or vitamin metabolite with no 
        patent protection be a commercially viable drug? Contrary to 
        management’s statements, alpha-tocopheryl quinone is a vitamin E 
        derivative. Specifically, according to peer-reviewed scientific 
        literature, alpha-tocopheryl quinone is oxidized vitamin E or a 
        metabolite of vitamin E [1, 2, 3]. Its structure has been known for 
        seven decades, as has its role as an oxidized derivative of vitamin E 
        [4]. Neither Penwest nor its licensor, Edison Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
        (“Edison”) has any issued patent covering either the composition or 
        the use of alpha tocopheryl quinone for the treatment of mitochondrial 
        diseases. Furthermore, a competitor, Santhera Pharmaceuticals 
        (“Santhera”), has a U.S. patent, issued more than 8 years ago, that 
        claims the use of derivatives of coenzyme Q for the treatment of 
        mitochondrial diseases and could be asserted as encompassing 
        alpha-tocopheryl quinone [5].
      

As an indicator of how Penwest spends its shareholders’ capital, 
        did Penwest get its money’s worth in its deal with Edison? 
        Under its agreement with Edison, Penwest has paid Edison $7.5 million, 
        including a $1.0 million upfront payment, a $1.0 million loan to 
        Edison that Penwest immediately wrote off through an impairment charge 
        for its full value, and $5.5 million in research funding over the 
        18-month period ending December 31, 2008. Since there is no 
        intellectual property covering alpha-tocopheryl quinone, what did 
        Penwest get in return for the upfront fee and loan? The $5.5 million 
        in research funding was intended for the discovery of follow-on 
        compounds that would be patentable new chemical entities. Have such 
        follow-on compounds materialized?
      

How would A0001 be competitive in the marketplace, or even be 
        able to make it to market in a timely fashion, should Santhera’s 
        idebenone be successful? Santhera’s idebenone, currently in 
        Phase 3 clinical trials, is many years ahead of A0001 in development. 
        If idebenone is proven effective and approved, would it not 
        significantly complicate the development of A0001 and limit its market 
        potential as outlined in our March 3, 2009 letter?
      

Why would A0001 still be worth pursuing if idebenone fails to 
        show efficacy? A0001 is chemically similar to idebenone and 
        both A0001 and idebenone are chemical analogues of the same prototype 
        molecule (coenzyme Q). Hence, what would be the rationale to continue 
        A0001’s development if idebenone does not demonstrate efficacy in its 
        Phase 3 trials?
      

How will proof of concept and “value creation” be achieved in 
        Phase 2a when biomarkers of oxidative stress have been invalidated as 
        surrogate end points? As stated in its March 12, 2009 letter 
        to shareholders, management continues to contend that it will “gain a 
        better understanding of proof of concept” through its Phase 1b and 2a 
        clinical trials planned for this year. As we outlined in our March 3, 
        2009 letter, the class of biomarkers that Penwest plans to measure in 
        its Phase 2a trial, namely markers of oxidative stress, have actually 
        been invalidated as surrogate end points for mitochondrial 
        diseases by Santhera’s clinical experience with idebenone. Hence, how 
        will proof of concept and “value creation” be achieved short of data 
        on clinical outcomes, which are many years and tens of millions of 
        dollars away?
      

If the officers and directors are so convinced of the merits of 
        the A0001 development program, why do they not accept our win-win 
        proposition and take it free of cost? We continue to be 
        disappointed in the directors’ and officers’ determination to spend 
        shareholders’ capital without any commitment to spend their own. In 
        our March 3, 2009 letter, we proposed that the Company enter into a 
        transaction with these insiders whereby Penwest grants them or an 
        entity they create rights to A0001 and any follow-on compounds, free 
        of charge, in return for the spending reductions we are seeking. Why 
        are they not interested in this proposal?
      


      In closing, we look forward to working with you, our fellow 
      shareholders, to obtain answers to these and other important questions 
      and, more importantly, to steer Penwest in a direction that will finally 
      maximize shareholder value.
    

      As soon as possible after Penwest’s Board establishes the dates for the 
      2009 Annual Meeting, we will be sending you our proxy materials. In the 
      meantime, please do not send back any proxy card you receive from 
      Penwest management. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to 
      call our proxy solicitations agent, The Altman Group, toll free at (866)
