Company history[edit]
The company is a component of Johnson Family Enterprises, previously known as Johnson Wax Associates, and grew out of diversification and acquisition efforts by S.C. Johnson during the 1970s. It became a profitable, self-sustaining outdoor equipment business known as Johnson Camping, Inc., later renamed Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA).
The Silva Compass[edit]
The company acquired the Silva Company USA operations in 1973, followed by Silva Ltd. Canada in 1985. From 1980, JWA imported Swedish-made compasses manufactured by Silva Production AB (Silva Group) for sale in North America.
In 1996, a decision by Silva Production AB of the Silva Group parent to begin marketing its Swedish-made Silva brand compasses via a new distribution network in North America with Brunton, Inc. led to litigation the following year between JWA, which owned the North American Silva distribution network, and Silva Production AB, the Swedish manufacturer.[1]
In 1998, JWA and Silva Production AB reached a settlement whereby JWA retained the exclusive right to sell compasses under the Silva brand in North America, made for JWA by other manufacturers. Silva Production AB retained the right to manufacture and sell compasses under its Silva trademark outside the United States and Canada.[2] JWA also retained the rights to some product names such as Explorer, Polaris, Ranger, 1, 2, 3 and others commonly recognized in the U.S. and Canadian markets and popularized during the time Silva Production AB was manufacturing Silva-brand compasses for JWA.[3] Silva Production AB was allowed to state on Nexus packaging and in the Nexus catalog that Nexus compasses are made by Silva Production AB, but did not retain the right to advertise this fact.[4] As of 2008, JWA (now known as Johnson Outdoors, Inc.) was sourcing most of its Silva brand compasses from PT Uwatec Batam, an Indonesia-based wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Outdoors, Inc.[5] The discontinued Silva 424 Wrist Sighting Compass was made for Johnson Outdoors by Suunto Oy of Finland, while the Silva Lensatic 360 compass is made in Taiwan.
Healthways[edit]
Healthways was a firm founded by Dick Klein which made scuba gear.[6] It went bankrupt in 1963; its successor company is Scubapro. It was one of the five original American diving gear makers: U.S. Divers, Healthways, Voit, Dacor, Swimaster. Healthways was notable as the first manufacturer to use "scuba" as a word rather than an acronym; their twin-hose scuba regulator line was called the "Scuba"; hence, one of their later models, the Scuba Pro, eventually became the name of the company when it was reorganized as Scubapro.[6] (Healthways's single-hose regulators were dubbed the "Scubair" line.)

Scubapro[edit]
Scubapro was founded in the United States in 1963 by Gustav Dalla Valle, Beuchat representative in USA and Dick Bonin to manufacture scuba gear. The "S" logo was adapted from the Beuchat “Souplair” regulator. In 1966 Scubapro introduced the first analogue "decompression meter", a forerunner of the dive computer and created the first "stab(ilizing) jacket", a vest-type buoyancy compensator, in 1978.[citation needed]
Scubapro merged with dive computer manufacturer Uwatec in 1997 and became part of Johnson Outdoors. The company, now known as "Scubapro Uwatec", currently manufactures diving regulators, buoyancy compensators, dive computers, masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits and drysuits, as well as scuba accessories.[7]
Uwatec[edit]
Uwatec was founded in Switzerland in 1984 as a manufacturer of scuba gear. In 1987 it introduced the Aladin PRO, establishing a reputation for making diving computers; however, multiple lawsuits accusing Uwatec (and later Johnson Outdoors) of a seven-year cover-up of a potentially lethal dive-computer bug tainted that reputation.[8][9] Uwatec merged with Scubapro in 1997, becoming part of Johnson Outdoors.[7]
Subgear[edit]
Subgear is the rebranded name of Seemann Sub a diving brand active in Germany since 1979 and focused on providing divers with quality dive equipment at reasonable prices. In April 2007 the Seemann brand was acquired by Johnson Outdoors Inc. as part of its diving division. As a result, Seemann products became available in the rest of Europe in 2008 and the brand was renamed SUBGEAR in 2010, coinciding with the brand expansion to the worldwide market.[10]
Jetboil[edit]
Since November 2012, Johnson Outdoors has owned Jetboil, a company that produces lightweight gas fueled portable stoves.[11][12] Jetboil, founded in 2001 is currently headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Current activity[edit]
The company produces tents and other camping and outdoor equipment under the Eureka brand name.
Since 1998, JWA, now Johnson Outdoors, Inc. has distributed Silva brand compasses in North America made by other manufacturers to Johnson Outdoors specifications, as well as other navigation and recreational products bearing the Silva brand name in North America.[13] Public offerings occurred in 1987 and 1988, with the Johnson family maintaining a strong ownership position. Johnson Outdoors has operations in 24 locations worldwide, employs 1,400 people and reports sales of more than $315 million. It is composed of individual, specialized companies. Helen Johnson-Leipold, one of Samuel Curtis Johnson, Jr.'s four children, runs the company.

Silva Production AB retained the right to manufacture and sell compasses under its Silva trademark outside the United States and Canada.[2] JWA also retained the rights to some product names such as Explorer, Polaris, Ranger, 1, 2, 3 and others commonly recognized in the U.S. and Canadian markets and popularized during the time Silva Production AB was manufacturing Silva-brand compasses for JWA.[3] Silva Production AB was allowed to state on Nexus packaging and in the Nexus catalog that Nexus compasses are made by Silva Production AB, but did not retain the right to advertise this fact.[4] As of 2008, JWA (now known as Johnson Outdoors, Inc.) was sourcing most of its Silva brand compasses from PT Uwatec Batam, an Indonesia-based wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Outdoors, Inc.[5] The discontinued Silva 424 Wrist Sighting Compass was made for Johnson Outdoors by Suunto Oy of Finland, while the Silva Lensatic 360 compass is made in Taiwan.
Healthways[edit]
Healthways was a firm founded by Dick Klein which made scuba gear.[6] It went bankrupt in 1963; its successor company is Scubapro. It was one of the five original American diving gear makers: U.S. Divers, Healthways, Voit, Dacor, Swimaster. Healthways was notable as the first manufacturer to use "scuba" as a word rather than an acronym; their twin-hose scuba regulator line was called the "Scuba"; hence, one of their later models, the Scuba Pro, eventually became the name of the company when it was reorganized as Scubapro.[6] (Healthways's single-hose regulators were dubbed the "Scubair" line.)

Scubapro[edit]
Scubapro was founded in the United States in 1963 by Gustav Dalla Valle, Beuchat representative in USA and Dick Bonin to manufacture scuba gear. The "S" logo was adapted from the Beuchat “Souplair” regulator. In 1966 Scubapro introduced the first analogue "decompression meter", a forerunner of the dive computer and created the first "stab(ilizing) jacket", a vest-type buoyancy compensator, in 1978.[citation needed]
Scubapro merged with dive computer manufacturer Uwatec in 1997 and became part of Johnson Outdoors. The company, now known as "Scubapro Uwatec", currently manufactures diving regulators, buoyancy compensators, dive computers, masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits and drysuits, as well as scuba accessories.[7]
Uwatec[edit]
Uwatec was founded in Switzerland in 1984 as a manufacturer of scuba gear. In 1987 it introduced the Aladin PRO, establishing a reputation for making diving computers; however, multiple lawsuits accusing Uwatec (and later Johnson Outdoors) of a seven-year cover-up of a potentially lethal dive-computer bug tainted that reputation.[8][9] Uwatec merged with Scubapro in 1997, becoming part of Johnson Outdoors.[7]
Subgear[edit]
Subgear is the rebranded name of Seemann Sub a diving brand active in Germany since 1979 and focused on providing divers with quality dive equipment at reasonable prices. In April 2007 the Seemann brand was acquired by Johnson Outdoors Inc. as part of its diving division. As a result, Seemann products became available in the rest of Europe in 2008 and the brand was renamed SUBGEAR in 2010, coinciding with the brand expansion to the worldwide market.[10]
Jetboil[edit]
Since November 2012, Johnson Outdoors has owned Jetboil, a company that produces lightweight gas fueled portable stoves.[11][12] Jetboil, founded in 2001 is currently headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Current activity[edit]
The company produces tents and other camping and outdoor equipment under the Eureka brand name.
Since 1998, JWA, now Johnson Outdoors, Inc. has distributed Silva brand compasses in North America made by other manufacturers to Johnson Outdoors specifications, as well as other navigation and recreational products bearing the Silva brand name in North America.[13] Public offerings occurred in 1987 and 1988, with the Johnson family maintaining a strong ownership position. Johnson Outdoors has operations in 24 locations worldwide, employs 1,400 people and reports sales of more than $315 million. It is composed of individual, specialized companies. Helen Johnson-Leipold, one of Samuel Curtis Johnson, Jr.'s four children, runs the company.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Company history[edit]
The company is a component of Johnson Family Enterprises, previously known as Johnson Wax Associates, and grew out of diversification and acquisition efforts by S.C. Johnson during the 1970s. It became a profitable, self-sustaining outdoor equipment business known as Johnson Camping, Inc., later renamed Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA).
The Silva Compass[edit]
The company acquired the Silva Company USA operations in 1973, followed by Silva Ltd. Canada in 1985. From 1980, JWA imported Swedish-made compasses manufactured by Silva Production AB (Silva Group) for sale in North America.
In 1996, a decision by Silva Production AB of the Silva Group parent to begin marketing its Swedish-made Silva brand compasses via a new distribution network in North America with Brunton, Inc. led to litigation the following year between JWA, which owned the North American Silva distribution network, and Silva Production AB, the Swedish manufacturer.[1]
In 1998, JWA and Silva Production AB reached a settlement whereby JWA retained the exclusive right to sell compasses under the Silva brand in North America, made for JWA by other manufacturers. Silva Production AB retained the right to manufacture and sell compasses under its Silva trademark outside the United States and Canada.[2] JWA also retained the rights to some product names such as Explorer, Polaris, Ranger, 1, 2, 3 and others commonly recognized in the U.S. and Canadian markets and popularized during the time Silva Production AB was manufacturing Silva-brand compasses for JWA.[3] Silva Production AB was allowed to state on Nexus packaging and in the Nexus catalog that Nexus compasses are made by Silva Production AB, but did not retain the right to advertise this fact.[4] As of 2008, JWA (now known as Johnson Outdoors, Inc.) was sourcing most of its Silva brand compasses from PT Uwatec Batam, an Indonesia-based wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Outdoors, Inc.[5] The discontinued Silva 424 Wrist Sighting Compass was made for Johnson Outdoors by Suunto Oy of Finland, while the Silva Lensatic 360 compass is made in Taiwan.

Healthways was a firm founded by Dick Klein which made scuba gear.[6] It went bankrupt in 1963; its successor company is Scubapro. It was one of the five original American diving gear makers: U.S. Divers, Healthways, Voit, Dacor, Swimaster. Healthways was notable as the first manufacturer to use "scuba" as a word rather than an acronym; their twin-hose scuba regulator line was called the "Scuba"; hence, one of their later models, the Scuba Pro, eventually became the name of the company when it was reorganized as Scubapro.[6] (Healthways's single-hose regulators were dubbed the "Scubair" line.)

Scubapro[edit]
Scubapro was founded in the United States in 1963 by Gustav Dalla Valle, Beuchat representative in USA and Dick Bonin to manufacture scuba gear. The "S" logo was adapted from the Beuchat “Souplair” regulator. In 1966 Scubapro introduced the first analogue "decompression meter", a forerunner of the dive computer and created the first "stab(ilizing) jacket", a vest-type buoyancy compensator, in 1978.[citation needed]
Scubapro merged with dive computer manufacturer Uwatec in 1997 and became part of Johnson Outdoors. The company, now known as "Scubapro Uwatec", currently manufactures diving regulators, buoyancy compensators, dive computers, masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits and drysuits, as well as scuba accessories.[7]
Uwatec[edit]
Uwatec was founded in Switzerland in 1984 as a manufacturer of scuba gear. In 1987 it introduced the Aladin PRO, establishing a reputation for making diving computers; however, multiple lawsuits accusing Uwatec (and later Johnson Outdoors) of a seven-year cover-up of a potentially lethal dive-computer bug tainted that reputation.[8][9] Uwatec merged with Scubapro in 1997, becoming part of Johnson Outdoors.[7]
Subgear[edit]
Subgear is the rebranded name of Seemann Sub a diving brand active in Germany since 1979 and focused on providing divers with quality dive equipment at reasonable prices. In April 2007 the Seemann brand was acquired by Johnson Outdoors Inc. as part of its diving division. As a result, Seemann products became available in the rest of Europe in 2008 and the brand was renamed SUBGEAR in 2010, coinciding with the brand expansion to the worldwide market.[10]
Jetboil[edit]
Since November 2012, Johnson Outdoors has owned Jetboil, a company that produces lightweight gas fueled portable stoves.[11][12] Jetboil, founded in 2001 is currently headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Current activity[edit]
The company produces tents and other camping and outdoor equipment under the Eureka brand name.
Since 1998, JWA, now Johnson Outdoors, Inc. has distributed Silva brand compasses in North America made by other manufacturers to Johnson Outdoors specifications, as well as other navigation and recreational products bearing the Silva brand name in North America.[13] Public offerings occurred in 1987 and 1988, with the Johnson family maintaining a strong ownership position. Johnson Outdoors has operations in 24 locations worldwide, employs 1,400 people and reports sales of more than $315 million. It is composed of individual, specialized companies. Helen Johnson-Leipold, one of Samuel Curtis Johnson, Jr.'s four children, runs the company.

Company history[edit]
The company is a component of Johnson Family Enterprises, previously known as Johnson Wax Associates, and grew out of diversification and acquisition efforts by S.C. Johnson during the 1970s. It became a profitable, self-sustaining outdoor equipment business known as Johnson Camping, Inc., later renamed Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA).
The Silva Compass[edit]
The company acquired the Silva Company USA operations in 1973, followed by Silva Ltd. Canada in 1985. From 1980, JWA imported Swedish-made compasses manufactured by Silva Production AB (Silva Group) for sale in North America.
In 1996, a decision by Silva Production AB of the Silva Group parent to begin marketing its Swedish-made Silva brand compasses via a new distribution network in North America with Brunton, Inc. led to litigation the following year between JWA, which owned the North American Silva distribution network, and Silva Production AB, the Swedish manufacturer.[1]
In 1998, JWA and Silva Production AB reached a settlement whereby JWA retained the exclusive right to sell compasses under the Silva brand in North America, made for JWA by other manufacturers. Silva Production AB retained the right to manufacture and sell compasses under its Silva trademark outside the United States and Canada.[2] JWA also retained the rights to some product names such as Explorer, Polaris, Ranger, 1, 2, 3 and others commonly recognized in the U.S. and Canadian markets and popularized during the time Silva Production AB was manufacturing Silva-brand compasses for JWA.[3] Silva Production AB was allowed to state on Nexus packaging and in the Nexus catalog that Nexus compasses are made by Silva Production AB, but did not retain the right to advertise this fact.[4] As of 2008, JWA (now known as Johnson Outdoors, Inc.) was sourcing most of its Silva brand compasses from PT Uwatec Batam, an Indonesia-based wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson Outdoors, Inc.[5] The discontinued Silva 424 Wrist Sighting Compass was made for Johnson Outdoors by Suunto Oy of Finland, while the Silva Lensatic 360 compass is made in Taiwan.
Healthways[edit]
Healthways was a firm founded by Dick Klein which made scuba gear.[6] It went bankrupt in 1963; its successor company is Scubapro. It was one of the five original American diving gear makers: U.S. Divers, Healthways, Voit, Dacor, Swimaster. Healthways was notable as the first manufacturer to use "scuba" as a word rather than an acronym; their twin-hose scuba regulator line was called the "Scuba"; hence, one of their later models, the Scuba Pro, eventually became the name of the company when it was reorganized as Scubapro.[6] (Healthways's single-hose regulators were dubbed the "Scubair" line.)

Scubapro[edit]
Scubapro was founded in the United States in 1963 by Gustav Dalla Valle, Beuchat representative in USA and Dick Bonin to manufacture scuba gear. The "S" logo was adapted from the Beuchat “Souplair” regulator. In 1966 Scubapro introduced the first analogue "decompression meter", a forerunner of the dive computer and created the first "stab(ilizing) jacket", a vest-type buoyancy compensator, in 1978.[citation needed]
Scubapro merged with dive computer manufacturer Uwatec in 1997 and became part of Johnson Outdoors. The company, now known as "Scubapro Uwatec", currently manufactures diving regulators, buoyancy compensators, dive computers, masks, fins, snorkels, wetsuits and drysuits, as well as scuba accessories.[7]
Uwatec[edit]
Uwatec was founded in Switzerland in 1984 as a manufacturer of scuba gear. In 1987 it introduced the Aladin PRO, establishing a reputation for making diving computers; however, multiple lawsuits accusing Uwatec (and later Johnson Outdoors) of a seven-year cover-up of a potentially lethal dive-computer bug tainted that reputation.[8][9] Uwatec merged with Scubapro in 1997, becoming part of Johnson Outdoors.[7]
Subgear[edit]
Subgear is the rebranded name of Seemann Sub a diving brand active in Germany since 1979 and focused on providing divers with quality dive equipment at reasonable prices. In April 2007 the Seemann brand was acquired by Johnson Outdoors Inc. as part of its diving division. As a result, Seemann products became available in the rest of Europe in 2008 and the brand was renamed SUBGEAR in 2010, coinciding with the brand expansion to the worldwide market.[10]

Why Johnson Outdoors Inc. Climbed 18% in May
Shares of the outdoor products company soared after a blowout earnings report. 











                Jeremy Bowman
            

                (TMFHobo)



            
            Jun 3, 2017 at 12:15PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Johnson Outdoors (NASDAQ:JOUT) were flying higher last month after the maker of boating, camping, and other outdoor equipment posted a strong first-quarter earnings report. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished the month up 18%.
As the chart below shows, the bulk of the gains came on May 5 in response to the earnings report.

Data by YCharts.
The stock got a further bump a couple of days later when Imperial Capital raised its price target to $49 from $44 per share.
So what 
The maker of Old Town canoes blew past estimates on both its top and bottom lines. Revenue in the quarter increased 11.6% to $149.8 million, well ahead of expectations of $137.6 million. Earnings per share, meanwhile, jumped 50% to $1.39, crushing the analyst consensus at $0.92 per share.
In the Fishing segment, which makes up more than two thirds of total sales, the company saw 16% growth, and also reversed an operating loss from a year ago in Diving.
CEO Helen Johnson-Leopold said, "Excitement in the market for Johnson Outdoors' innovative new product line-up is giving us a great start to the year."

Now what
Management did not provide guidance in the press release, but analysts lifted their full-year EPS estimates from $2.40 to $2.87 on the report. Outdoor-products companies have had mixed results of late, but the momentum in the Fishing division looks promising. Management touted the Minn Kota outboard motor brand and Humminbird digital fish finders in particular. 
With the stock still trading at a modest valuation, there's plenty of room for it to keep moving higher.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
