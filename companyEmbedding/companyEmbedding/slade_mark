Early life[edit]
Born in Salem, Massachusetts, Slade is the son of Elinor (née Van Blarcom) and William A. Slade, Jr., a Boston businessman and watercolor artist. Along with his two sisters and a brother, he grew up in the Danvers/Hamilton area of the North Shore. His parents divorced when he was thirteen and his stepfather, Esmond R. Crowley, Jr., became a valuable influence on his life.
In 1956, he enrolled in Worcester Academy with the intention of becoming an artist. After he filled in for a sick classmate by playing the role of an English professor in the play The Male Animal, he decided to study acting. Slade moved to New York City to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts,[2] supporting himself by working at the "21 Club."
During the beginning of his career in the early 1960s, Slade served in the United States Army Reserve.
Career[edit]
Actor[edit]
Slade began his career on the Broadway stage appearing in the Josh Logan-directed play, There Was a Little Girl, Jane Fonda's first Broadway play. He then earned a role in the 1961 film Splendor in the Grass, directed by Elia Kazan and filmed in upstate New York. In the early 1960s, he moved to the West Coast, where he was cast as Seaman Jimmy "Red" Smith in the feature film Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961). Despite his character being killed in the movie version, Irwin Allen brought Slade back for the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series) on ABC. He was cast in 1964 as a new character, Seaman Malone.[1]:1145 He was hence the only one of six actors to have been cast in both the film and television versions of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He appeared only in the first half of the first season because he departed to become a semi-regular, "Eddie," in the CBS sitcom, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., starring Jim Nabors. Slade appeared in eight episodes of Gomer Pyle, all of which were aired during the first half of the first season. He was cast in three episodes of the NBC education drama, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus in the title role. His first television role was as Stu Walters in the 1961 episode "Deadline" of the ABC sitcom, My Three Sons, starring Fred MacMurray. In 1963, he was cast as Jack Grinnage in the episode "A Girl Named Amy" of Jack Lord's ABC series, Stoney Burke, a rodeo adventure series. In 1964, he guest-starred in "The Enormous Fist" episode of "Rawhide" opposite Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood. That year he also appeared as the title character Michael Manning, alias Michael Da Vinci, in the Perry Mason episode, "The Case of the Careless Kidnapper."
In the 1965-1966 television season, Slade played Radioman Patrick Hollis in the NBC sitcom, The Wackiest Ship in the Army.[1]:1147
In 1966, at the age of twenty-seven, he obtained one of his most memorable parts, as Billy Blue Cannon, the blond-haired, blue-eyed son of the ranch patriarch, John Cannon (Leif Erickson) on The High Chaparral, set in the Arizona Territory. The series aired for four seasons. He went on to play Taylor Reed in the syndicated adventure series Salty in 1974.[1]:924
Slade's acting career continued into the early 1990s. He made more than three hundred appearances on stage, screen, and television. Slade won international recognition and numerous awards for his efforts: the Belgian Viewers Award, the Bambi, the Bravo Golden Otto, and the Western Heritage Award.
Artist[edit]
As an artist, Slade's illustrations, political cartoons, caricatures, and comic strips have run in numerous newspapers, magazines and prominent publications around the world. His collaboration with producer/writer Danny Arnold (Barney Miller television series) resulted in the long-running comic strip, "Howard and Friends."
A number of his later works done in oils and graphite, as well as, his hand-pulled prints are held in private collections. He continues to offer his work on his website www.marksladestudio.com
Writer[edit]
As a writer, Slade is well known for writing and playing the guest role in the "Cliffy" episode of The Rookies television series, which won him critical acclaim and numerous citations. In 2012, he authored his first published novel, GOING DOWN MAINE, which explores the loss of innocence and unforeseen consequences of youthful indiscretions. Published in late 2014, OF PAIN AND COFFEE, a collection of sooths, sayings and soliloquies that explore life's foibles and fears, joys and heartbreaks, with illustrations by the author, was released. In December, 2014 Mark published a companion book, SOMEONE'S STORY, that takes the reader on an emotional journey through those brief moments when we can feel another's life. The author's own photography creates a subtle melding of the pictorial and verse. HANGIN' WITH THE TRUTH, his second novel, was released in 2016. -- Available on AMAZON and Barnes & Noble NOOK.
Slade also lent his talents to the Slade Media Group, founded by his wife Melinda Riccilli Slade, that specialized in corporate image campaigns, crisis management, graphic design and marketing communications. The firm created national campaigns for diverse public and private companies along with numerous product introductions. Together, they wrote and developed various media projects through their affiliated company, Slade Square Productions.
Personal life[edit]
Slade married Melinda Riccilli in 1968. They have two sons, the contemporary artist, Morgan Riccilli Slade and designer/builder Mitchel W. Slade. He is currently living in Northern California, where he continues the pursuit of his artistic endeavors.
Slade's maternal grandmother, Alice Louise (née Ford) Van Blarcom, was Henry Ford's fifth cousin. His Ford lineage goes back to Martha and John Ford who reached Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the Fortune, the second English ship to arrive in Plymouth Colony, on November 9, 1621. John Ford died on the voyage. Martha disembarked with their two sons and gave birth to their third on the same day. The ship's manifest lists among the passengers, a John Cannon, also the name of the patriarch in The High Chaparral.

Register your trademark to protect it. (Image: Set of simbols image by PaulPaladin from <a href='http://www.fotolia.com'>Fotolia.com</a>)


While it is not something that is required, trademark registration is important because it puts the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) behind you in protecting your mark. By registering your mark, you protect it nationally. Registration allows you to use ®, a notification that the trademark is registered. You would have the right for exclusive use of the mark and can also sue if you feel that your trademark has been infringed upon. 

 







 




Search the USPTO database for free at the Trademark Electronic Search System website to determine if someone else has already claimed rights to the mark that you are interested in registering. Alternatively, you can do a search at the Public Search Library, by going to Madison East, 1st Floor, 600 Dulany St., Alexandria, VA 22313. The library is open from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. eastern time. 

 




Draft a description of your product that is detailed and complete enough to identify your product, using language and clear and concise terms that would be easily understandable by the general public. Examples are available at the Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual website. 

 




Choose the format of your mark: standard character format or stylized design format. The standard character format is used to register characters without any consideration to font, size or color. A stylized design format has a specific style, like when you see the “M” arches of McDonald’s. 













Promoted by









File your application online using the Trademark Electronic Application System website or contact the Trademark Assistance Center at 800-786-9199 for a paper form. 

 




Follow the progress your registration application through the Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval website using the serial number that you will receive after filing your application. 



 

 






Tips & Warnings

Early life[edit]
Born in Salem, Massachusetts, Slade is the son of Elinor (née Van Blarcom) and William A. Slade, Jr., a Boston businessman and watercolor artist. Along with his two sisters and a brother, he grew up in the Danvers/Hamilton area of the North Shore. His parents divorced when he was thirteen and his stepfather, Esmond R. Crowley, Jr., became a valuable influence on his life.
In 1956, he enrolled in Worcester Academy with the intention of becoming an artist. After he filled in for a sick classmate by playing the role of an English professor in the play The Male Animal, he decided to study acting. Slade moved to New York City to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts,[2] supporting himself by working at the "21 Club."
During the beginning of his career in the early 1960s, Slade served in the United States Army Reserve.
Career[edit]
Actor[edit]
Slade began his career on the Broadway stage appearing in the Josh Logan-directed play, There Was a Little Girl, Jane Fonda's first Broadway play. He then earned a role in the 1961 film Splendor in the Grass, directed by Elia Kazan and filmed in upstate New York. In the early 1960s, he moved to the West Coast, where he was cast as Seaman Jimmy "Red" Smith in the feature film Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961). Despite his character being killed in the movie version, Irwin Allen brought Slade back for the Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series) on ABC. He was cast in 1964 as a new character, Seaman Malone.[1]:1145 He was hence the only one of six actors to have been cast in both the film and television versions of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. He appeared only in the first half of the first season because he departed to become a semi-regular, "Eddie," in the CBS sitcom, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., starring Jim Nabors. Slade appeared in eight episodes of Gomer Pyle, all of which were aired during the first half of the first season. He was cast in three episodes of the NBC education drama, Mr. Novak, starring James Franciscus in the title role. His first television role was as Stu Walters in the 1961 episode "Deadline" of the ABC sitcom, My Three Sons, starring Fred MacMurray. In 1963, he was cast as Jack Grinnage in the episode "A Girl Named Amy" of Jack Lord's ABC series, Stoney Burke, a rodeo adventure series. In 1964, he guest-starred in "The Enormous Fist" episode of "Rawhide" opposite Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood. That year he also appeared as the title character Michael Manning, alias Michael Da Vinci, in the Perry Mason episode, "The Case of the Careless Kidnapper."
In the 1965-1966 television season, Slade played Radioman Patrick Hollis in the NBC sitcom, The Wackiest Ship in the Army.[1]:1147
In 1966, at the age of twenty-seven, he obtained one of his most memorable parts, as Billy Blue Cannon, the blond-haired, blue-eyed son of the ranch patriarch, John Cannon (Leif Erickson) on The High Chaparral, set in the Arizona Territory. The series aired for four seasons. He went on to play Taylor Reed in the syndicated adventure series Salty in 1974.[1]:924
Slade's acting career continued into the early 1990s. He made more than three hundred appearances on stage, screen, and television. Slade won international recognition and numerous awards for his efforts: the Belgian Viewers Award, the Bambi, the Bravo Golden Otto, and the Western Heritage Award.
Artist[edit]
As an artist, Slade's illustrations, political cartoons, caricatures, and comic strips have run in numerous newspapers, magazines and prominent publications around the world. His collaboration with producer/writer Danny Arnold (Barney Miller television series) resulted in the long-running comic strip, "Howard and Friends."
A number of his later works done in oils and graphite, as well as, his hand-pulled prints are held in private collections. He continues to offer his work on his website www.marksladestudio.com
Writer[edit]
As a writer, Slade is well known for writing and playing the guest role in the "Cliffy" episode of The Rookies television series, which won him critical acclaim and numerous citations. In 2012, he authored his first published novel, GOING DOWN MAINE, which explores the loss of innocence and unforeseen consequences of youthful indiscretions. Published in late 2014, OF PAIN AND COFFEE, a collection of sooths, sayings and soliloquies that explore life's foibles and fears, joys and heartbreaks, with illustrations by the author, was released. In December, 2014 Mark published a companion book, SOMEONE'S STORY, that takes the reader on an emotional journey through those brief moments when we can feel another's life. The author's own photography creates a subtle melding of the pictorial and verse. HANGIN' WITH THE TRUTH, his second novel, was released in 2016. -- Available on AMAZON and Barnes & Noble NOOK.
Slade also lent his talents to the Slade Media Group, founded by his wife Melinda Riccilli Slade, that specialized in corporate image campaigns, crisis management, graphic design and marketing communications. The firm created national campaigns for diverse public and private companies along with numerous product introductions. Together, they wrote and developed various media projects through their affiliated company, Slade Square Productions.
Personal life[edit]
Slade married Melinda Riccilli in 1968. They have two sons, the contemporary artist, Morgan Riccilli Slade and designer/builder Mitchel W. Slade. He is currently living in Northern California, where he continues the pursuit of his artistic endeavors.
Slade's maternal grandmother, Alice Louise (née Ford) Van Blarcom, was Henry Ford's fifth cousin. His Ford lineage goes back to Martha and John Ford who reached Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the Fortune, the second English ship to arrive in Plymouth Colony, on November 9, 1621. John Ford died on the voyage. Martha disembarked with their two sons and gave birth to their third on the same day. The ship's manifest lists among the passengers, a John Cannon, also the name of the patriarch in The High Chaparral.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1903 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
