Biography

Zachary (Zach) S. Stern is a patent attorney in the firm's Electrical Patent Prosecution group. He is experienced in preparing and prosecuting patent applications and reexaminations, and providing client counseling and opinions regarding enforcement, licensing, and product design alternatives.
As an experienced patent attorney, Mr. Stern has represented both foreign and domestic clients of all sizes to protect a broad array of inventions with detailed experience in both consumer and industrial technologies, including optics, image and video processing, portable cellular communication and computing, semiconductor device fabrication, satellite and ground-based telecommunication, wind power generation, and aircraft equipment.
Mr. Stern draws upon almost 20 years of engineering experience as a principal engineer, engineering manager and program director for Fairchild Industries, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Smiths Aerospace. While an engineer, Mr. Stern developed custom integrated circuits, high-density and ruggedized electronic packaging, aircraft, satellite and vehicle electronic sub-systems, satellite and radio vehicle tracking and communication systems, and a variety of software applications for strategic simulation, locale visualization and mission planning.
Building upon his formal education in control algorithms and artificial intelligence, Mr. Stern was formerly the chief software architect for a large multi-national simulation project including detailed aircraft simulation models executed in real-time with dynamic input from human actors. Mr. Stern also managed a large engineering development program to provide urban mass transit system operators with artificial intelligence tools to assist dispatchers in efficiently correcting service disruptions.
In addition to prosecuting patents, Mr. Stern counsels clients on practical aspects of patent licensing and responding to challenges from competitors. His deep understanding of complex technologies and practical experience enables him to communicate effectively with scientists, inventors and business leaders to create and enforce the broadest patents possible to meet their business goals.EducationGeorge Washington University Law School (J.D.)University of Maryland (M.S.)Electrical EngineeringUniversity of Virginia (B.S.)Electrical EngineeringAdmissions
