“ You really try to choose a banking partner you believe will ultimately earn and maintain your trust. In 2007, we bet on UMB. I would be hard-pressed to say there is anybody else out there that could come in and years later be as sincere and professional today as the day we met and still deliver. UMB has done just that. ”- Bill Phillips, CEO of Vornado

Investing in our communities today, to create a better tomorrow.









UMB provided associates a total of 9,540 hours of qualified time off in 2015.

 




For over a century UMB has committed to the prosperity of every community we serve.

 




$231k estimated economic value of UMB associates’ volunteer hours in 2016*.

 




We believe unique perspectives add value to UMB by energizing the workplace.

 






UMB Financial Corporation’s community involvement philosophy guides how the company and associates invest their time and talent, and helps determine where sponsorships and donations are made. More than any one value, UMB is dedicated to the prosperity of every community it serves. We continuously contribute to the vibrancy and success of these communities by supporting:
 
• Agriculture
• Arts
• Financial Education
• Self Sufficiency
 
*Source: Independent Sector




UMB and our associates annually donate substantial amounts of time and money to help local nonprofits and charitable organizations in all of the communities we serve.

Through UMB's Volunteer Time Off program, eligible employees receive up to 16 hours of paid time off to volunteer with organizations that support their personal passions and interests.
We have received local and national recognition for our corporate responsibility and diversity and inclusion programs. As our business has expanded over the past 100 years, so has our philanthropic support and volunteerism outreach in the communities where we live and do business. We are proud of these contributions and of our associates for their dedicated service that truly makes a difference.
