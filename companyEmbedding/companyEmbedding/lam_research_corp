We move atoms that move the world.
At Lam Research, we create equipment that allows chipmakers to build device features more than 1,000 times smaller than a grain of sand. This tiny scale has a huge impact. Virtually every leading-edge chip inside the electronic products you use every day (TVs, smartphones, laptops, cars—even medical devices) has been made using our equipment. 
As one of the world’s most trusted suppliers in the semiconductor equipment industry, we’re transforming technology. Our equipment places atoms so precisely that nearly every chip today is made using our innovations. 
This success is enabled by our world-class employees, who are the reason why nearly every chip today is built with Lam technology. At Lam, we know that our dynamic, global team of exceptional employees is essential to the company’s continued growth, and we are committed to providing you with the resources and career path opportunities you seek.
But our real strength is our team. At Lam, we are all Atom Engineers. Whether you’re in operations, supply chain management, or customer support; whether you’re an engineer, a technician, or a specialist; whether you’re a senior leader or recent grad, you’re helping our customers manipulate the tiny building blocks of atoms … and move the world.

PRODUCTS OVERVIEW
Enabling Chipmakers to Create the Future















Our Role
Advanced microchips are in many of the familiar products we use every day—from mobile phones and computing devices to entertainment gadgets and the latest array of features on cars. Electronic products are everywhere and life without them is unimaginable.
Producing the tiny, complex chips used in these devices involves the repetition of a set of core processes and includes hundreds of individual steps. To do this successfully, semiconductor manufacturers require sophisticated processes and fabrication equipment. 
As a market-leading equipment supplier, Lam Research works closely with customers to deliver the products and technologies needed to enable their success. By offering critical chip-processing capabilities, our products provide a vital link between the visionary designs for the latest electronic devices and the companies that produce them. 
Our Processing Solutions
Market demand for continuously shrinking chip dimensions is driving the development of and migration to new fabrication strategies that enable producing these advanced devices with fine, closely packed features. Creating the cutting-edge microprocessors and memory devices for today’s products is extremely challenging and requires precision control at the atomic scale. 
Through collaboration and drawing on multiple areas of expertise, Lam continues to develop the new capabilities required to manufacture increasingly complex devices with shrinking dimensions. Our innovative technology and productivity solutions for transistor, interconnect, patterning, advanced memory, and advanced packaging applications deliver a wide range of wafer processing capabilities needed to create the latest chips. 
Our Products
Lam Research offers a broad portfolio of market-leading products for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning – complementary processing steps that are repeated multiple times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process flow.
For applications that do not require the most advanced wafer processing capability, we offer proven solutions with a suite of previous-generation legacy products. We have also extended our products to provide production-worthy and cost-effective solutions for the MEMS and LED manufacturing markets.

History[edit]
Lam Research was founded in 1980 by David K. Lam, a Chinese-born engineer who had previously worked at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.[3] It was while he was at Hewlett Packard that he saw the need for better plasma etching equipment, to keep up with the rapid miniaturization of semiconductor wafers.[3] He credited Bob Noyce, founder of Intel, for assisting him in getting funding by ensuring his business plan made sense.
In 1981, the company introduced its first product, the AutoEtch 480, an automated polysilicon plasma etcher. The name AutoEtch was chosen to convey that the etcher was automated, while the 80 in 480 came from 1980, the year the company was founded.[4] The first system was sold in January 1982.[5] In 1982, Roger Emerick was appointed CEO.[6]
In May 1984, the company issued an IPO and was listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol LRCX.[7] In 1985, David Lam left the company to join Link Technologies, which eventually was bought by Wyse[8] and is now Dell Wyse.[9] In the mid-1980s, Lam Research continued its global expansion, concentrating on Taiwan and also opening customer support centers throughout Europe, the United States and Japan.[9]
By the early 1990s, the company had a presence in China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.[9] In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million.[10] CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing.[citation needed] In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO.[9][11] In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board.[11]
In 2005, Steve Newberry was appointed as CEO.[12] In 2006, Lam Research acquired Bullen Semiconductor, now Silfex, Inc.[13] In 2008, Lam Research acquired SEZ AG,[14] now Lam Research AG.[15] In 2011, Lam Research agreed to buy San Jose, California chip equipment manufacturer Novellus Systems, for $3.3B.[16] The deal was completed in June 2012.[17] In 2012, Martin Anstice was appointed as CEO.[12] In October 2015, Lam Research announced plans to buy Milpitas, California-based wafer inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[18] In June 2016, it was announced that Lam Research had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[19] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[20] over antitrust concerns.[21]
Products[edit]
Lam Research designs and builds products for semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning processes. Repeated throughout semiconductor manufacturing, these technologies help create transistors, interconnects, advanced memory, and packaging structures. They are also used for applications in related markets like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).[1]
Thin Film Deposition[edit]
Lam's thin film deposition systems lay down the sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials that make up an integrated circuit. The processes require uniformity at the nanoscale level.[22]
The company employs electrochemical deposition (ECD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies to form copper and other metal films for conducting structures.[23][24] Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also used for tungsten metal films in features like contacts and plugs, which are vertical connections between metal lines in multilevel interconnect chip designs.
Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD technologies create dielectric films for a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. PECVD and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes.
Plasma Etch[edit]
Lam Research uses proprietary technology in its equipment for plasma etch,[25] the process of selectively removing materials from the surface of a wafer in order to create the semiconductor device's features and patterns. The equipment helps chip manufacturers carve small features such as those needed for the latest multiple patterning sequences, transistors, and advanced memory structures, which involve increasingly complex film stacks and ever higher aspect ratio structures.
The company uses reactive ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to shape a variety of conductive and dielectric features.[25] The company’s deep RIE technologies help create structures for applications like MEMS and through-silicon vias (TSVs).
Photoresist Strip[edit]
Lam’s dry strip systems use plasma technology to selectively remove the photoresist mask following a range of front-end wafer processing and advanced packaging applications.[26]
Wafer Cleaning[edit]
Lam Research's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues, and films from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes.[27]
The company’s spin wet clean technology is used between chip-processing steps to remove yield-limiting residues and defects. Lam’s bevel clean technology directs a plasma at the very edge of the wafer to clean unwanted particles, residues, and films. If not removed, these materials can impact yield if they flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent manufacturing steps.
Customers[edit]
The company markets its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia.[28]
Facilities[edit]
Lam has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, and Korea and sales and services offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.[29]

The name AutoEtch was chosen to convey that the etcher was automated, while the 80 in 480 came from 1980, the year the company was founded.[4] The first system was sold in January 1982.[5] In 1982, Roger Emerick was appointed CEO.[6]
In May 1984, the company issued an IPO and was listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol LRCX.[7] In 1985, David Lam left the company to join Link Technologies, which eventually was bought by Wyse[8] and is now Dell Wyse.[9] In the mid-1980s, Lam Research continued its global expansion, concentrating on Taiwan and also opening customer support centers throughout Europe, the United States and Japan.[9]
By the early 1990s, the company had a presence in China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.[9] In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million.[10] CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing.[citation needed] In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO.[9][11] In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board.[11]
In 2005, Steve Newberry was appointed as CEO.[12] In 2006, Lam Research acquired Bullen Semiconductor, now Silfex, Inc.[13] In 2008, Lam Research acquired SEZ AG,[14] now Lam Research AG.[15] In 2011, Lam Research agreed to buy San Jose, California chip equipment manufacturer Novellus Systems, for $3.3B.[16] The deal was completed in June 2012.[17] In 2012, Martin Anstice was appointed as CEO.[12] In October 2015, Lam Research announced plans to buy Milpitas, California-based wafer inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[18] In June 2016, it was announced that Lam Research had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[19] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[20] over antitrust concerns.[21]
Products[edit]
Lam Research designs and builds products for semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning processes. Repeated throughout semiconductor manufacturing, these technologies help create transistors, interconnects, advanced memory, and packaging structures. They are also used for applications in related markets like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).[1]
Thin Film Deposition[edit]
Lam's thin film deposition systems lay down the sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials that make up an integrated circuit. The processes require uniformity at the nanoscale level.[22]
The company employs electrochemical deposition (ECD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies to form copper and other metal films for conducting structures.[23][24] Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also used for tungsten metal films in features like contacts and plugs, which are vertical connections between metal lines in multilevel interconnect chip designs.
Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD technologies create dielectric films for a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. PECVD and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes.
Plasma Etch[edit]
Lam Research uses proprietary technology in its equipment for plasma etch,[25] the process of selectively removing materials from the surface of a wafer in order to create the semiconductor device's features and patterns. The equipment helps chip manufacturers carve small features such as those needed for the latest multiple patterning sequences, transistors, and advanced memory structures, which involve increasingly complex film stacks and ever higher aspect ratio structures.
The company uses reactive ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to shape a variety of conductive and dielectric features.[25] The company’s deep RIE technologies help create structures for applications like MEMS and through-silicon vias (TSVs).
Photoresist Strip[edit]
Lam’s dry strip systems use plasma technology to selectively remove the photoresist mask following a range of front-end wafer processing and advanced packaging applications.[26]
Wafer Cleaning[edit]
Lam Research's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues, and films from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes.[27]
The company’s spin wet clean technology is used between chip-processing steps to remove yield-limiting residues and defects. Lam’s bevel clean technology directs a plasma at the very edge of the wafer to clean unwanted particles, residues, and films. If not removed, these materials can impact yield if they flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent manufacturing steps.
Customers[edit]
The company markets its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia.[28]
Facilities[edit]
Lam has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, and Korea and sales and services offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.[29]

Lam Research Corporation is an American corporation that engages in the design, manufacture, marketing, and service of semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.[2] Its products are used primarily in front-end wafer processing, which involves the steps that create the active components of semiconductor devices (transistors, capacitors) and their wiring (interconnects). The company also builds equipment for back-end wafer-level packaging (WLP), and for related manufacturing markets such as for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
Lam Research was founded in 1980 by Dr. David K. Lam and is headquartered in Fremont, California, in the Silicon Valley.

History[edit]
Lam Research was founded in 1980 by David K. Lam, a Chinese-born engineer who had previously worked at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.[3] It was while he was at Hewlett Packard that he saw the need for better plasma etching equipment, to keep up with the rapid miniaturization of semiconductor wafers.[3] He credited Bob Noyce, founder of Intel, for assisting him in getting funding by ensuring his business plan made sense.
In 1981, the company introduced its first product, the AutoEtch 480, an automated polysilicon plasma etcher. The name AutoEtch was chosen to convey that the etcher was automated, while the 80 in 480 came from 1980, the year the company was founded.[4] The first system was sold in January 1982.[5] In 1982, Roger Emerick was appointed CEO.[6]
In May 1984, the company issued an IPO and was listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol LRCX.[7] In 1985, David Lam left the company to join Link Technologies, which eventually was bought by Wyse[8] and is now Dell Wyse.[9] In the mid-1980s, Lam Research continued its global expansion, concentrating on Taiwan and also opening customer support centers throughout Europe, the United States and Japan.[9]
By the early 1990s, the company had a presence in China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.[9] In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million.[10] CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing.[citation needed] In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO.[9][11] In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board.[11]
In 2005, Steve Newberry was appointed as CEO.[12] In 2006, Lam Research acquired Bullen Semiconductor, now Silfex, Inc.[13] In 2008, Lam Research acquired SEZ AG,[14] now Lam Research AG.[15] In 2011, Lam Research agreed to buy San Jose, California chip equipment manufacturer Novellus Systems, for $3.3B.[16] The deal was completed in June 2012.[17] In 2012, Martin Anstice was appointed as CEO.[12] In October 2015, Lam Research announced plans to buy Milpitas, California-based wafer inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[18] In June 2016, it was announced that Lam Research had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[19] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[20] over antitrust concerns.[21]
Products[edit]
Lam Research designs and builds products for semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning processes. Repeated throughout semiconductor manufacturing, these technologies help create transistors, interconnects, advanced memory, and packaging structures. They are also used for applications in related markets like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).[1]
Thin Film Deposition[edit]
Lam's thin film deposition systems lay down the sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials that make up an integrated circuit. The processes require uniformity at the nanoscale level.[22]
The company employs electrochemical deposition (ECD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies to form copper and other metal films for conducting structures.[23][24] Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also used for tungsten metal films in features like contacts and plugs, which are vertical connections between metal lines in multilevel interconnect chip designs.
Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD technologies create dielectric films for a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. PECVD and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes.
Plasma Etch[edit]
Lam Research uses proprietary technology in its equipment for plasma etch,[25] the process of selectively removing materials from the surface of a wafer in order to create the semiconductor device's features and patterns. The equipment helps chip manufacturers carve small features such as those needed for the latest multiple patterning sequences, transistors, and advanced memory structures, which involve increasingly complex film stacks and ever higher aspect ratio structures.
The company uses reactive ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to shape a variety of conductive and dielectric features.[25] The company’s deep RIE technologies help create structures for applications like MEMS and through-silicon vias (TSVs).
Photoresist Strip[edit]
Lam’s dry strip systems use plasma technology to selectively remove the photoresist mask following a range of front-end wafer processing and advanced packaging applications.[26]
Wafer Cleaning[edit]
Lam Research's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues, and films from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes.[27]
The company’s spin wet clean technology is used between chip-processing steps to remove yield-limiting residues and defects. Lam’s bevel clean technology directs a plasma at the very edge of the wafer to clean unwanted particles, residues, and films. If not removed, these materials can impact yield if they flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent manufacturing steps.
Customers[edit]
The company markets its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia.[28]
Facilities[edit]
Lam has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, and Korea and sales and services offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.[29]

History[edit]
Lam Research was founded in 1980 by David K. Lam, a Chinese-born engineer who had previously worked at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.[3] It was while he was at Hewlett Packard that he saw the need for better plasma etching equipment, to keep up with the rapid miniaturization of semiconductor wafers.[3] He credited Bob Noyce, founder of Intel, for assisting him in getting funding by ensuring his business plan made sense.
In 1981, the company introduced its first product, the AutoEtch 480, an automated polysilicon plasma etcher. The name AutoEtch was chosen to convey that the etcher was automated, while the 80 in 480 came from 1980, the year the company was founded.[4] The first system was sold in January 1982.[5] In 1982, Roger Emerick was appointed CEO.[6]
In May 1984, the company issued an IPO and was listed on NASDAQ, with the symbol LRCX.[7] In 1985, David Lam left the company to join Link Technologies, which eventually was bought by Wyse[8] and is now Dell Wyse.[9] In the mid-1980s, Lam Research continued its global expansion, concentrating on Taiwan and also opening customer support centers throughout Europe, the United States and Japan.[9]
By the early 1990s, the company had a presence in China, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.[9] In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million.[10] CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing.[citation needed] In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO.[9][11] In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board.[11]
In 2005, Steve Newberry was appointed as CEO.[12] In 2006, Lam Research acquired Bullen Semiconductor, now Silfex, Inc.[13] In 2008, Lam Research acquired SEZ AG,[14] now Lam Research AG.[15] In 2011, Lam Research agreed to buy San Jose, California chip equipment manufacturer Novellus Systems, for $3.3B.[16] The deal was completed in June 2012.[17] In 2012, Martin Anstice was appointed as CEO.[12] In October 2015, Lam Research announced plans to buy Milpitas, California-based wafer inspection equipment vendor KLA-Tencor for $10.6B, in what was viewed as a semiconductor industry consolidation move.[18] In June 2016, it was announced that Lam Research had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[19] In October 2016, the company announced it had terminated its offer for KLA-Tencor amidst concerns that the deal would not meet regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice[20] over antitrust concerns.[21]
Products[edit]
Lam Research designs and builds products for semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etch, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning processes. Repeated throughout semiconductor manufacturing, these technologies help create transistors, interconnects, advanced memory, and packaging structures. They are also used for applications in related markets like microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).[1]
Thin Film Deposition[edit]
Lam's thin film deposition systems lay down the sub-microscopic layers of conducting (metal) or insulating (dielectric) materials that make up an integrated circuit. The processes require uniformity at the nanoscale level.[22]
The company employs electrochemical deposition (ECD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technologies to form copper and other metal films for conducting structures.[23][24] Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is also used for tungsten metal films in features like contacts and plugs, which are vertical connections between metal lines in multilevel interconnect chip designs.
Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD technologies create dielectric films for a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. PECVD and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes.
Plasma Etch[edit]
Lam Research uses proprietary technology in its equipment for plasma etch,[25] the process of selectively removing materials from the surface of a wafer in order to create the semiconductor device's features and patterns. The equipment helps chip manufacturers carve small features such as those needed for the latest multiple patterning sequences, transistors, and advanced memory structures, which involve increasingly complex film stacks and ever higher aspect ratio structures.
The company uses reactive ion etch (RIE) and atomic layer etching (ALE) to shape a variety of conductive and dielectric features.[25] The company’s deep RIE technologies help create structures for applications like MEMS and through-silicon vias (TSVs).
Photoresist Strip[edit]
Lam’s dry strip systems use plasma technology to selectively remove the photoresist mask following a range of front-end wafer processing and advanced packaging applications.[26]
Wafer Cleaning[edit]
Lam Research's wet spin clean and plasma-based bevel clean products remove particles, residues, and films from the wafer surface before or after adjacent processes.[27]
The company’s spin wet clean technology is used between chip-processing steps to remove yield-limiting residues and defects. Lam’s bevel clean technology directs a plasma at the very edge of the wafer to clean unwanted particles, residues, and films. If not removed, these materials can impact yield if they flake off and re-deposit on the device area during subsequent manufacturing steps.
Customers[edit]
The company markets its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe and Asia.[28]
Facilities[edit]
Lam has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Austria, and Korea and sales and services offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.[29]

 We expect wafer fabrication equipment provider, Lam Research Corporation LRCX  to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 26.   Why a Likely Positive Surprise?    Our proven model shows that Lam Research is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.   Zacks ESP  : Earnings ESP  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.33%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Zacks Rank  : Lam Research currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.    The combination of Lam Research's Zacks Rank # 1 and Earnings ESP of +1.33% makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat.    Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 54.7%.      What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Results?    Lam Research continues to be the market leader in dielectric etches on successful products such as VECTOR Strata, ALTUS deposition, and its Flex and Kiyo etch products.  The company sees strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market driven by its long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications.    The company has been improving on the WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains.    Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has initiated cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies, which is expected to positively impact its margins.    Moreover, Lam Research is making good progress with its customer support business and anti-trust agency reviews.   Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS     Surprise        Lam Research Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Lam Research Corporation Quote   Other Stocks Worth Considering    Here are a few companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:    IPG Photonics Corporation IPGP  with an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Kemet Corporation KEM  with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.    SBA Communications Corporation SBAC  with an Earnings ESP of +10% and a Zacks Rank #1.   More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!    It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.    Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020.

Stock quotes in this article: lrcx, intc, nvda, nflx, googl, mbly, amzn

Earnings season got aggressive this week. Sure, last week we wrapped up much of the financial space, but now we dance with the information technology sector. For joy, the land where fortunes are both won and lost overnight. Overnight? Better change that to a matter of minutes. Many tech names are extremely volatile and will see their market value change in a matter of seconds upon the fast money reaction to their quarterly earnings reports. Just take a look at the market reaction to the corporate performance of Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) . What will the markets react to? PE ratios? Not likely. Growth, or the possibility of growth? Very likely. You don't need to know much more than that if for you these names are simply a trade. That said, what if one wishes to invest in the space? That's a little trickier, and hanging on to huge gains going into an earnings release can certainly be an extremely stressful event.
Why I Like Nvidia, Lam Research and Intel 
When I look for investment opportunities in tech, I have to see engagement in the development of what I consider to be relevant (or hot) segments of the industry. Artificial intelligence, autonomous cars, block-chain mining and cyber-security come to mind. What other factors figure into my decision making? Treasury yields? Well, yes, that always matters. A tax-reform inspired repatriation holiday? Again yes, but that's sort of like watching the chimney to see if Santa Claus arrives. U.S. dollar valuations? Bingo!
Dollar Bill, Y'all
Cheap dollars will boost earnings for large U.S. multinationals. We have been pounding that table all year, especially since fellow columnist and currency expert Douglas Borthwick told the world that the U.S. currency was over-valued. He told us that right here at TheStreet, and he told us that many months prior to anyone else I heard say it in the industry.
Did you know that the tech sector, broadly speaking, generates 57% of its revenue outside of U.S. borders? Did you know that within the tech sector, semiconductor names, again broadly speaking, are exposed to an even greater degree than the sector itself? For semiconductors, that exposure is an incredible 87%. What? Yup, really. See, the things you can figure out when you're just a guy scouring the financial universe for an edge.
So, What Do We Want?
1) Engagement in the development of relevant of hot business lines.
2) An edge.
These two ingredients are all that's really needed to invest in the tech space in and around earnings. Seems simple, right? Until it's not. As an investor, though, unlike with a trader, time is your friend. Even if you're wrong, you can adjust, hedge, and re-allocate. A trader wins or loses. It's fast. An investor plants a flag, and develops as does the stock. What am I? I am both, and I keep the two separate. Different books for different strategies. How much easier it is to organize your thoughts once you learn that little trick.
Semi-Conductors That Have the Edge
Lam Research (LRCX) reports tomorrow afternoon. Consensus is for $3.02 a share. The whisper number is roughly a nickel higher than that. The street is looking for revenue of $2.31 billion. This is perhaps my favorite name in the industry. What do they do? They design, manufacture, refurbish, and service wafer fabrication equipment. In other words, these guys make the stuff that the rest of the industry needs to do whatever it is that they do. Cellphones, tablets, computers, storage, networks... all need what LRCX provides.
Intel Corp. (INTC) reports Thursday afternoon. Here, the industry is looking for EPS of $0.68 on revenues of $14.41 billion. This is my sleeper. Not much in the way of performance for a very long time, yet the name provides a dividend yield of 3.1%, while you wait for something good to happen. Long involved in computers, the firm has spread its wings into the cloud, cyber security, not to mention the acquisition of Mobileye (MBLY) in order to make a splash in the growing autonomous vehicle industry. CEO Brian Krzanich usually presents very well, and I look forward to the call on Thursday evening.
Nvidia Corp (NVDA) does not report until August 10, so you have some time. Consensus is for earnings of $0.69 a share on revenue of $1.96 billion. Whispers are up above $0.75, and possibly already priced into the last sale. I love this name. It's hard not to. I joined the party late, and it's already one of my best trades over the last couple of years. It is hard to imagine a company more squarely focused on everything that is relevant right now than NVDA. Artificial intelligence, big data research, cloud-based computing, the ability to integrate an entire computer onto a single chip. What? Yup. That means gaming, designing, entertainment, drones, autos, and robots. Did I mention the mining of block-chain? I don't know about you, but when I write this article next year, I hope I'm still long NVDA.
... which brings us to Amazon
It's not that I do not like Amazon (AMZN) . I do. It's certainly not a semiconductor name. It's more of an everything name. I have already been long AMZN twice this year, and made significant gains both times. This time, it could be different. Call it intuition, but my spider sense is tingling. Amazon reports this Thursday. Expectations are for EPS of $1.38 on revenue of $37.2 billion. Whispers are for an EPS number a nickel higher than that expectation.
Why am I iffy on Amazon? You all know that I am a Walmart WMT fan. That is not it, though. I have no problem being long both of these names. The stock is trading $45 above its 50-day simple moving average SMA. Think that's cool? Just look at things in perspective. NVDA is a $165 stock, while AMZN is trading $166 above its 200 day SMA. See what I mean? That's possibly outlandish.
I will not know if I am willing to take a shot in AMZN prior to Thursday's close, but I do know that I will not be long the shares at that time. If I short any, it will be within five minutes of that closing bell, and I will be flat long before 5pm. This would be a trade for me, not an investment.
That, my friends will depend on just how bold I feel in 48 hours. Buying one put option with a strike price around the last sale that expires this Friday will run the average home gamer around $2400, and could be almost worthless immediately if you're wrong. Not a warm and fuzzy option.

AMD's stock surges to lead S&P 500 gainers in active trade
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  surged 3.9% in active midday trade Friday, enough to pace the S&P 500's  gainers, amid a broad rally in semiconductor stock. Volume topped 49 million shares within two hours after the open, which is already more than half the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. The PHLX Semiconductor Index  hiked up 1.6%, as the stocks of three other chip companies were among the top S&P 500's gainers: Lam Research Corp.'s  ran up 3.1%, Applied Materials Inc.'s  climbed 3.0% and Nvidia Corp.'s  rallied 2.1%. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised his stock price target for Applied Materials to $52 from $47, and for Lam Research to $168 from $135. Moore said he believes capital spending in chips and display is continuing to improve, and that memory strength is driving an "unprecedented" memory cash flow. AMD's stock has now rallied 19% year to date, while the SOX has rallied 16% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.2%.

AMD's stock surges to lead S&P 500 gainers in active trade
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  surged 3.9% in active midday trade Friday, enough to pace the S&P 500's  gainers, amid a broad rally in semiconductor stock. Volume topped 49 million shares within two hours after the open, which is already more than half the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. The PHLX Semiconductor Index  hiked up 1.6%, as the stocks of three other chip companies were among the top S&P 500's gainers: Lam Research Corp.'s  ran up 3.1%, Applied Materials Inc.'s  climbed 3.0% and Nvidia Corp.'s  rallied 2.1%. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised his stock price target for Applied Materials to $52 from $47, and for Lam Research to $168 from $135. Moore said he believes capital spending in chips and display is continuing to improve, and that memory strength is driving an "unprecedented" memory cash flow. AMD's stock has now rallied 19% year to date, while the SOX has rallied 16% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.2%.
