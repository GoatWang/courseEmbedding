Our Team

Professionalism, experience and knowledge. The power behind our success. And yours.


Our commitment to providing world-class affirmative action planning and compliance services is exemplified by our impressive growth. In just a few short years, we have expanded our team to more than 20 top-notch professionals. Each dedicated to our clients’ success. The result? An enhanced level of service and scope of expertise for any affirmative action need you might have.



I started working with the people of OutSolve almost 10 years ago. They help us prepare our affirmative action plans and help support and enhance our diversity initiatives. Most importantly, they help guide us through the complexities of compliance. They are responsive, very professional, and know their business! They also have a sense of urgency and are fun and easy to work with!
