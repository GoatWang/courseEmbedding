Bauer Foundation Establishes Professorship in Organizational Ethics at Washington University


July 22, 2007






Washington University in St. Louis has announced that its John M. Olin School of Business has received a grant from the Bauer Foundation in New Canaan, Connecticut, to establish the George and Carol Bauer Professorship in organizational ethics and governance.In 2004, the Bauers established an endowed scholarship as part of the Spirit of Washington University scholarship program, which provides emergency financial assistance to students who experience unforeseen financial problems that could preclude them from remaining in school. A Missouri native and former IBM executive, George P. Bauer graduated from WU's school of engineering and applied science in 1953."At the Olin School of Business, we are strongly committed to educating our students in corporate governance and advancing personal and professional ethics," said Mahendra Gupta, Ph.D., the Geraldine J. and Robert L. Virgil Professor of Accounting and Management and dean of the Olin School. "This professorship affirms our resolve and inspires us. It will significantly enhance our research, business, and classroom engagements. I am deeply thankful to George and Carol Bauer for this important investment and support, the impact of which will be felt for years to come." 

 "Bauers Establish Professorship in Organizational Ethics, Governance."  Washington University Press Release  07/16/2007.
