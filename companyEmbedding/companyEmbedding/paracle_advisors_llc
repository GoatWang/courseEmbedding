An investment portfolio structured to meet your needs. 




We take our responsibility as an investment advisor seriously and will not invest your financial resources until we explore and fully understand your requirements. We help you determine specific cash-flow needs, identify the return required to meet your long-term goals, and explore your personal preferences. With this three-dimensional understanding, we are equipped to create an investment strategy that is strategically aligned with you.    
Our investment approach is anchored in the following core beliefs:

Conflict-Free

Our only compensation comes directly and explicitly from the clients that we serve. There are no sales commissions for selling you one product versus another, and we do not accept any form of compensation from distributors of investment products. We are truly independent.

Service-Driven

We contend that the best financial firms choose to be either service-driven or product-driven.  When a firm attempts to both provide services and structure products, it is a prescription for conflicts of interest, even if no sales commissions are earned. We have not developed any in-house proprietary products. This ensures that we truly seek the best investment solutions available globally, with no incentive (whether financial or ego-driven) to recommend one solution over another. We are and will always remain a service-driven organization, committed to keeping our service clear and straightforward.

Predicting the Future

It is extraordinarily difficult for any forecaster, no matter how intelligent and well-intended, to accurately and consistently predict economic trends and stock market returns over time. Individuals are no better than experts in this regard. Historical evidence proves that the most realistic path to success is to remain fully invested with a solid plan and a long-term perspective. 

Research Produces Results

We dedicate significant time and resources to investment research. This research leads to a high level of conviction and discipline in our approach to preserving and growing financial assets. Although investment research does not guarantee success, a lack of education and discipline will almost certainly lead to failure. Our research helps bring sense and direction to what can be a chaotic investment world full of complex products and strategies.

A Broad Strategy is Better

Various investment strategies perform well at different times. Smoother return patterns are therefore accomplished by diversification across multiple strategies. We focus on investment opportunities that are globally diversified across a variety of investment types and styles.

Buy-and-Rebalance

From time to time, financial markets will experience either extreme pessimism or extreme optimism, causing an investment portfolio to stray from its intended targets. Left unadjusted, a portfolio can become either too risky or too conservative. We sell over-heated areas at times of maximum optimism when prices are high, and buy into downtrodden asset classes at time of maximum pessimism, when prices are lower. This simple discipline is an effective way to add value and control risk.

costs matter

We know that taxes, fees, and transaction costs can significantly impact portfolio returns. We strive to manage all three, allowing you to keep more of what you earn. As a professional advisor, we have access to institutional investments with lower expenses than those available to retail investors.

I joined Paracle in 2010, bringing 15 years of experience in the investment industry. Prior to joining Paracle, I spent over 7 years as an analyst for Quellos Group (now Blackrock). During my tenure, I had the opportunity to work with both high net worth families and institutional clients. My prior experience includes advisory positions at both Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Investments. 
I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in Business Administration. I hold the Series 65, Uniform Investment Adviser license and I am currently working toward obtaining the CFP® certification. Away from the office, I enjoy spending time with my wife, two sons and golden lab. I am an avid runner and enjoy watching all UW sports.

BBB Reason for Ratings

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

NetSpend® Visa® Prepaid Card


                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem. On June 5, 2017 my account was hacked and $1000 was transferred to someone I've never heard of. I filed a dispute and after 3 days NetSpend returned the money to...show more

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.
