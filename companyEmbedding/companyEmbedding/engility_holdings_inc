FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Location Profile: Charleston, SC






Our Charleston, SC office hosts more than 150 employees who support the Navy Space and Warfare System Center, Atlantic (SPAWAR) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Department of Defense and Federal/Civilian teams are co-located in the same facility, allowing them to share services and have a relationship that benefits both the team and the customers. In the past six years, this team has helped the VA drop the backlog of disability claims below 100,000 (compared to a high in 2013 of 611,000). This reduction was possible due in part to the ability to process disability claims electronically from start to finish – more than 99.8 percent of department’s pending disability claims inventory is now fully electronic using the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS)VBMS. The team was awarded a gold American Business Award in 2015 for Product Management Department/ Team of the Year. When the team isn’t working, they volunteer their time at the local VA Medical Center; they were awarded the Above and Beyond Award by the Employer Support of the National Guard and Reserve in 2015.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.03      Market Cap $1.07 B     Shares Outstanding 36.77 M     Public Float 18.68 M     Yield EGL has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.11      Net Money Flow ($)  14,396    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
