Vivek Ranadivé Driving the Information Busby Julia Hanna Topics:

In a few years there will be no such thing as an e-business," says Vivek Y.Ranadivé (MBA 1983). As founder, chairman, and CEO of Palo Alto-based TIBCO Software, Inc., (www.tibco.com) it would seem that Ranadivé is predicting the demise of his own company. Among other functions, TIBCO's software provides the infrastructure (or"middleware") that makes e-commerce work across disparate computer systems. His meaning, however, is just the opposite..

"The concept of e-business will disappear because every business will be an
e-business," Ranadivé explains. "Physical stores won't go away; they'll be
knitted into the fabric of how people buy and sell goods and services."


Skeptics might disagree with such a sweeping declaration, but they would be
hard-pressed to disregard TIBCO Software's growth since its founding in 1996. Total
revenues for fiscal 1999 were $96.4 million, an 83 percent increase over the previous
year. The company, which employs about one thousand workers worldwide, went public in
July 1999; an article that appeared last February in Red Herring's online edition (www.redherring.com)
noted that TIBCO's stock had risen 1,200 percent from its initial public offering
price. With a $15 billion market cap and a $300 million revenue run rate per year,
TIBCO is one of the fastest-growing software companies ever.


Like any corporate executive, Ranadivé is concerned with the dollars-and-cents
valuation of his company and how that affects future growth. But he drops the word
"dream" in conversation more frequently than "market cap," "stock options," or "IPO."
A native of Bombay, India, Ranadivé says he feels both international and
American. "You can have big dreams here," he remarks. "The United States is a very
multicultural and open country. When dealing with technology, open systems that can
be leveraged by anyone will thrive over closed, proprietary systems; I think of the
United States as an open system in that sense."


One of Ranadivé's earliest dreams was to study at MIT, which he learned of
through a documentary film on the institution. Despite the economic and emotional
difficulty of attending the faraway university, Ranadivé persevered, and in
1975 he arrived in Cambridge with fifty dollars in his pocket. He credits his parents
for their support of his plans. "My family comes from a tradition of education and
public service," he says, noting that his grandmother was the first female judge in
India and that his father, who now lives in California, is involved in charitable
projects in India and the United States. In four years, Ranadivé completed a
bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and a master's in mechanical engineering.
After a brief stint at Ford Motor Company and with the network equipment provider
Linkabit, he decided to enroll at HBS. 


"I wanted to get the best education, and I felt that Harvard was the best business
school," Ranadivé states, citing the case method and the quality of the HBS
faculty as among the School's strongest attributes. "In some ways the case method
explains why Survivor was such a popular television show," he laughs. "You throw a
bunch of people into one classroom and see who shines. I wanted to learn more about
people and human interactions, so HBS was an extremely valuable experience for me."


Not long after leaving Soldiers Field, Ranadivé had an idea that would
transform the computer industry. "My background was as a hardware engineer," he says.
"If you look inside a computer, there's a back plane, or bus, with cards that plug in
to run the machine's functions. My idea was to create a software bus and plug
applications into that." As simple as it sounds, this insight had a dramatic impact
on the financial services institutions that were among Ranadivé's first
customers. (TIBCO is an acronym for The Information Bus Company.)In 1985, investment
banks were researching new systems for streamlining the flow of data. When
Ranadivé arrived at Goldman Sachs, his first potential client, he was
astounded by the complicated assortment of monitors, cable, and wire surrounding each
trader  the mix even included strategically placed electric fans to cool overheated
equipment. Former Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, then head of Goldman Sachs
equities trading department, hired Ranadivé's newly formed Teknekron Software
Systems to consolidate this hodgepodge of data traffic to work within a single
desktop computer. His software did just that, and before long Teknekron dominated the
business of automating trading floors. In 1994, Ranadivé sold the company to
Reuters Group PLC for $125 million; it now employs some twelve hundred workers and
operates separately as TIBCO Finance Technology Inc.  


Rather than retire at the ripe old age of 36, Ranadivé developed his software
bus for other industries under the umbrella of TIBCO Software. "In many ways, the
trading floor of the 1990s was a microcosm of e-business today," he observes.
"Starting a company to automate the financial industry was the greatest training
possible for the Internet revolution." TIBCO now provides software to a range of
industries that includes high-tech manufacturing, telecommunications, energy, retail,
e-business, and the Internet. Motorola, Intel, Enron, Cisco Systems, Procter &
Gamble, Delta Air Lines, and Yahoo! are just a few of TIBCO's customers. Diverse as
these companies may be, TIBCO's product performs the same essential function for all
of them: delivering information across networks in real time. Ranadivé shares
his expertise in his 1999 book, The Power of Now, in which he explores the impact on
business of what is often referred to as "event-driven" software or "push"
technology.


Beyond the wide-ranging influence TIBCO already enjoys, Ranadivé envisions a
"metanetwork" of the future. "There'll be ubiquitous computing," he predicts, "with
billions of sensors and microprocessors. For example, your lawn will determine that
it's dry, and sprinklers will automatically water it." The more immediate task at
hand, however, is keeping TIBCO on top. 


"One of the biggest challenges is to make sure we continue to hire really good
employees," says Ranadivé. "We have lots of millionaires around here  plenty
of people who don't have to come to work every day. I need to have dreams that are
big enough to keep them interested.


"Another concern is staying nimble," he continues. "Someone in a garage right now is
inventing a product that could be threatening to me. It's important to stay paranoid
and avoid complacency."


Which isn't to say Ranadivé doesn't find time to play tennis or bicycle with
his two sons (ages 16 and 12) and his 7-year-old daughter. He also serves on the
board of San Francisco's Jewish Museum. "I view Judaism as being the source code for
Western civilization," Ranadivé remarks. Hindu by birth, he prefers to
envision a world in which shared values take precedence over individual religions. 


A strong belief in the advantages of open, accepting systems  whether technological
or theological  underlies much of Ranadivé's philosophy, particularly when
he considers TIBCO and his function at the company. "My role is to let people do
their own thing and make sure that what comes out is music. It's more like leading a
jazz group than a marching band. That's the job of a leader."

After earning bachelor's and master's degrees from MIT, he obtained an MBA from Harvard University in 1983.[8][9] While at MIT, Ranadivé started his first company, a UNIX consulting company.[7] He also held management and engineering positions with Ford Motor Company, M/A-Com Linkabit and Fortune Systems.[10]
Teknekron Software Systems[edit]
Teknekron Corp., a technology incubator, provided $250,000 in seed capital to Ranadivé in 1985 to found Teknekron Software Systems.[11]

Vivek Ranadive Gives Sacramento Kings New Direction with Technology

 NBA, Technology February 26, 2014February 25, 2014  Adam Xu 





 It has been a decade since the Sacramento Kings have made headlines in the western conference playoffs. Until recently, it’s as if this NBA franchise had been forgotten. In 2004, the Kings were one of the most exciting teams in the NBA. The franchise electrified fans everywhere, and they were contenders in the playoffs for several years.  Vivek Ranadive is determined to return the Kings back to that throne.
Unlike most franchise owners, Vivek Ranadive’s passion for the sport came at a very late age. A single father to three children, he volunteered to coach a middle school girls basketball team, in hopes of spending more time with his daughter Anjali. Having no prior experience or even touching a basketball, Ranadive managed to lead that team to the national championship.
In Malcolm Gladwell’s new best seller David and Goliath, the acclaimed author featured Vivek Ranadive’s coaching experience in his opening chapter. Undersized and under skilled, Ranadive’s approach to the game was to full court press all the teams, all the time. In order for David to beat Goliath, he had to choose an unconventional strategy, one where the underdog could level out the playing field. Ranadive embodies this principle both on the court and in how he conducts his business.
In the summer of 1969, 12 year old Vivek Ranadive had his ears glued to the radio during the moon landing. For Ranadive, that one small step for man inspired him to come to America. After leaving Mumbai, India at age 17, his underdog story would begin at the prestigious MIT, where he obtained his bachelors and masters degree, both within four years. At age 26, he obtained his MBA from Harvard as a Baker Scholar. As a young entrepreneur, Ranadive pursued his first business venture while still at MIT, which would later become UNIX Consulting Services. Since then, Ranadive’s vision has led him to establish benchmark technology companies such as Teknekron Software Systems and TIBCO.
Today, the 56 year old CEO and founder of TIBCO software resides in an estate in Silicon Valley. His technology company specializes in infrastructure and business intelligence software. As of last year, TIBCO was capitalized at $5.1 Billion dollars.
Ranadive’s story however, extends beyond Silicon Valley, and even the sports industry itself.  It is a story of the America dream, a father and his daughter, and how David was able to beat Goliath.
As a former minority owner of the Golden State Warriors, Ranadive had implemented significant developments to their social media network. After acquiring the Kings Franchise in May 2013, Ranadive has already made momentous changes to the Franchise’s culture and future direction.
Ranadive had TIBCO develop a Sacramento Kings App specifically for their fans. The app allows fans to earn points through digital interaction, allowing them to redeem Kings tickets and merchandise. The King’s app includes mobile ticketing functions and other all access information. The app also allows location based offers, and provides other functions that enhance the overall fan experience. The network incorporates high speed messaging, real time event processing engines, and various visual capturing devices. Ranadive’s vision is to expand the Kings globally. The app aims to have fans across the world have the same experience as those sitting in the arena.
With the new culture of technology, the Kings introduced the Google Glass broadcast on January 24th against the Indiana Pacers. The franchise partnered with CrowdOptic to provide a unique perspective to the game. Select players, staff, mascots, dancers, and announcers provided visual feed that would allow fans to have a first person experience.

The Kings have also announced that by March 1st,  fans will be able to purchase tickets and merchandise through Bitcoins. In doing so, the team would become the first professional sports franchise to accept the virtual currency.
Following a threat of relocation, the team is now seeing an increase in ticket sales, and a positive outlook from the fan response. The franchise is also expecting to move to a $448 million dollar arena in 2016.
The NBA has always maximized social networking to engage their fans. Considering that one of the NBA’s main areas of development is to expand their product globally, Ranadive’s technological approach could serve as a precedent to the league’s future direction.
Although the Kings are still in the bottom rankings of the western conference, the franchise has found momentum towards a new direction. As the new owner of the Sacramento Kings, Vivek Ranadive is once again the underdog. For David, the Goliath he now faces has become faster, stronger, and probably shoots 3s.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
In 1985, Teknekron Corporation, a technology incubator, provided $250000 in seed capital to Vivek Ranadivé.[4] In 1986 Teknekron Software Systems was founded, and in 1987, spun off into an independent company.[5] The company's principal innovation was a software product known as the Teknekron Information Bus (abbreviated as TIB), which transfers vital data between software programs.[4]
In the year 1986, Teknekron had a consulting project with Goldman Sachs to develop computer driven stock trading.[6][7] In 1987, the first TIB –  for the integration and delivery of market data such as stock quotes, news and other financial information –  went live at Fidelity Investments, followed by First Interstate Bank and Salomon Brothers, eventually digitizing all of Wall Street.[8] Teknekron's software bus programming allowed data to be shared between computers using different languages and different applications.[9] Wall Street trading firms used the software for trading systems, and eventually, large-scale manufacturers employed the technology as well.[10] Ranadivé said, "We digitized Wall Street. You had 20 television monitors that you had to look at. What we did was get rid of all that and replaced it with a Sun workstation. All of that information could now be treated as digitized information."[11]
In December 1993, Reuters Holdings PLC bought Teknekron Software Systems Inc. for $125.1 million in cash.[5]
Initial public offering[edit]
In 1997, Ranadivé founded TIBCO (The Information Bus Company).[12][13] The bus software allowed communication within the financial markets to happen in real-time and without human intervention. The technology was used by companies like SAP, IBM, and Oracle.[4] Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 of Microsoft's partners in "push" technology, which delivers internet content to users for free through web browsers.[14]
Before going public, an analyst promoted it.[15] The company's initial public offering (IPO) of stock was made in July 1999 with a range value of $9 to $11.[16] In its first day of trading, the company's stock doubled, from $17.38 to $32.38 per share[17][18] and in early 2000, the company's value went from $22.75 to $244.88 per share, its record high at the time.[19] After the IPO, the company raised $109.5 million and 7.3 million common shares sold for $15 each, above its range value.[20]
In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed using TIBCO Software that allowed companies to develop customized communications between computers.[11] Corporate Yahoo contained early examples of bundled e-mail, calendars, stock prices, and news displayed on intranet homepages. Hewlett-Packard was one of the partners in the software's development.[21]
Post-IPO[edit]
The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among USA Today's e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom.[22] During the first and second quarters of 2001, the firm's market capitalization approached $2 billion.[23][24]
In 2002, Verity, Inc., an American business portal infrastructure software provider, announced an expanded alliance with the company to integrate Verity K2 Developer technology with TIBCO ActivePortal 4.0 to better meet the needs of their customers.[25]
In 2003, British mobile operator Vodafone and Indian mobile provider Reliance Communications began using the firm's software, and Delta Air Lines used TIBCO software to organize its operation systems, including baggage handling, ticketing and check-in.[26][27] The same year, Lufthansa also used their software and Deutsche Bahn used it to construct digitally integrated train stations.[28][29]
In 2004, Wellpoint and RealMed used TIBCO technology to process HIPAA claims,[30] and Harrah's casinos used predictive software to analyze system demands.[31] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Allstate Insurance used its programming to process insurance claims.[32] Since its release in 2007, Apple's iPhone has used their software to process user requests and facilitate sales.[33] Xcel Energy launched its SmartGridCity program in 2009, which provided assistance to companies seeking to reduce carbon emissions, while using TIBCO software.[34]
By 2011, the company's annual revenues had grown to $920 million, its customer base to 4,000, and its number of employees to 2,500.[35][36][37][38] In March 2013, TIBCO announced that had chosen LaunchSquad as its corporate PR Agency of Record.[39]
In September 2014, TIBCO revealed it was being bought out by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion.[40]
On December 5, 2014, the acquisition of TIBCO by Vista Equity Partners was completed.[41] Murray Rode was made the CEO of TIBCO.
Products[edit]
The company's infrastructure software focuses on real-time communication for business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee data transfers,[1][42] including facilitation of communication between otherwise incompatible software.[43] The company provides middleware, which allows for access to real-time data between multiple systems while predicting users' needs.[44] The software appears in Amazon.com's personalized product recommendations, and FedEx's package tracking system.[44] Clients also use the software's feedback to deliver special offers to customers based on their browsing habits.[23]
TIBCO ActiveMatrix is a technology-neutral platform for composite business process management (BPM) and service-oriented architecture (SOA) applications. The platform includes products for service creation and integration, distributed service and data grids, packaged applications, BPM and governance.[45]
TIBCO ActiveSpaces is a distributed elastic peer-to-peer transactional datastore based on the tuple space concepts. It stores, retrieves and queries data stored into Spaces and distributes changes to that data in real-time in a true 'push' manner. It can function as an alternative datastore (with ACID properties and query filtering criteria expressed as SQL-compatible strings), messaging system (or a combination of the two), processing large amounts of data in a distributed manner.
TIBCO BusinessEvents is complex event processing (CEP) software to identify meaningful patterns across a business by correlating massive volumes of data with discrete events and applying predefined rules to identify situations that require a response.
TIBCO Enterprise Message Service is a standards-based messaging platform (fully TCK certified to both the JMS 1.1 and 2.0 standards)[46] that simplifies and accelerates the integration and management of data distribution in high-performance, enterprise environments.

TIBCO tibbr, announced in January 2011, is a social media system for the workplace.[53] It manages input and output feeds to outside programs and integrates with other social media platforms.[53] Sixty companies, encompassing 50,000 users, have signed up.[54][55] tibbr 3.0, launched in June 2011, added HD video conferencing, and distinguishes between public and private information sharing.[56][57][58]

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
In 1985, Teknekron Corporation, a technology incubator, provided $250000 in seed capital to Vivek Ranadivé.[4] In 1986 Teknekron Software Systems was founded, and in 1987, spun off into an independent company.[5] The company's principal innovation was a software product known as the Teknekron Information Bus (abbreviated as TIB), which transfers vital data between software programs.[4]
In the year 1986, Teknekron had a consulting project with Goldman Sachs to develop computer driven stock trading.[6][7] In 1987, the first TIB –  for the integration and delivery of market data such as stock quotes, news and other financial information –  went live at Fidelity Investments, followed by First Interstate Bank and Salomon Brothers, eventually digitizing all of Wall Street.[8] Teknekron's software bus programming allowed data to be shared between computers using different languages and different applications.[9] Wall Street trading firms used the software for trading systems, and eventually, large-scale manufacturers employed the technology as well.[10] Ranadivé said, "We digitized Wall Street. You had 20 television monitors that you had to look at. What we did was get rid of all that and replaced it with a Sun workstation. All of that information could now be treated as digitized information."[11]
In December 1993, Reuters Holdings PLC bought Teknekron Software Systems Inc. for $125.1 million in cash.[5]
Initial public offering[edit]
In 1997, Ranadivé founded TIBCO (The Information Bus Company).[12][13] The bus software allowed communication within the financial markets to happen in real-time and without human intervention. The technology was used by companies like SAP, IBM, and Oracle.[4] Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 of Microsoft's partners in "push" technology, which delivers internet content to users for free through web browsers.[14]
Before going public, an analyst promoted it.[15] The company's initial public offering (IPO) of stock was made in July 1999 with a range value of $9 to $11.[16] In its first day of trading, the company's stock doubled, from $17.38 to $32.38 per share[17][18] and in early 2000, the company's value went from $22.75 to $244.88 per share, its record high at the time.[19] After the IPO, the company raised $109.5 million and 7.3 million common shares sold for $15 each, above its range value.[20]
In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed using TIBCO Software that allowed companies to develop customized communications between computers.[11] Corporate Yahoo contained early examples of bundled e-mail, calendars, stock prices, and news displayed on intranet homepages. Hewlett-Packard was one of the partners in the software's development.[21]
Post-IPO[edit]
The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among USA Today's e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom.[22] During the first and second quarters of 2001, the firm's market capitalization approached $2 billion.[23][24]
In 2002, Verity, Inc., an American business portal infrastructure software provider, announced an expanded alliance with the company to integrate Verity K2 Developer technology with TIBCO ActivePortal 4.0 to better meet the needs of their customers.[25]
In 2003, British mobile operator Vodafone and Indian mobile provider Reliance Communications began using the firm's software, and Delta Air Lines used TIBCO software to organize its operation systems, including baggage handling, ticketing and check-in.[26][27] The same year, Lufthansa also used their software and Deutsche Bahn used it to construct digitally integrated train stations.[28][29]
In 2004, Wellpoint and RealMed used TIBCO technology to process HIPAA claims,[30] and Harrah's casinos used predictive software to analyze system demands.[31] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Allstate Insurance used its programming to process insurance claims.[32] Since its release in 2007, Apple's iPhone has used their software to process user requests and facilitate sales.[33] Xcel Energy launched its SmartGridCity program in 2009, which provided assistance to companies seeking to reduce carbon emissions, while using TIBCO software.[34]
By 2011, the company's annual revenues had grown to $920 million, its customer base to 4,000, and its number of employees to 2,500.[35][36][37][38] In March 2013, TIBCO announced that had chosen LaunchSquad as its corporate PR Agency of Record.[39]
In September 2014, TIBCO revealed it was being bought out by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion.[40]
On December 5, 2014, the acquisition of TIBCO by Vista Equity Partners was completed.[41] Murray Rode was made the CEO of TIBCO.
Products[edit]
The company's infrastructure software focuses on real-time communication for business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee data transfers,[1][42] including facilitation of communication between otherwise incompatible software.[43] The company provides middleware, which allows for access to real-time data between multiple systems while predicting users' needs.[44] The software appears in Amazon.com's personalized product recommendations, and FedEx's package tracking system.[44] Clients also use the software's feedback to deliver special offers to customers based on their browsing habits.[23]
TIBCO ActiveMatrix is a technology-neutral platform for composite business process management (BPM) and service-oriented architecture (SOA) applications. The platform includes products for service creation and integration, distributed service and data grids, packaged applications, BPM and governance.[45]
TIBCO ActiveSpaces is a distributed elastic peer-to-peer transactional datastore based on the tuple space concepts. It stores, retrieves and queries data stored into Spaces and distributes changes to that data in real-time in a true 'push' manner. It can function as an alternative datastore (with ACID properties and query filtering criteria expressed as SQL-compatible strings), messaging system (or a combination of the two), processing large amounts of data in a distributed manner.
TIBCO BusinessEvents is complex event processing (CEP) software to identify meaningful patterns across a business by correlating massive volumes of data with discrete events and applying predefined rules to identify situations that require a response.
TIBCO Enterprise Message Service is a standards-based messaging platform (fully TCK certified to both the JMS 1.1 and 2.0 standards)[46] that simplifies and accelerates the integration and management of data distribution in high-performance, enterprise environments.

TIBCO tibbr, announced in January 2011, is a social media system for the workplace.[53] It manages input and output feeds to outside programs and integrates with other social media platforms.[53] Sixty companies, encompassing 50,000 users, have signed up.[54][55] tibbr 3.0, launched in June 2011, added HD video conferencing, and distinguishes between public and private information sharing.[56][57][58]

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
In 1985, Teknekron Corporation, a technology incubator, provided $250000 in seed capital to Vivek Ranadivé.[4] In 1986 Teknekron Software Systems was founded, and in 1987, spun off into an independent company.[5] The company's principal innovation was a software product known as the Teknekron Information Bus (abbreviated as TIB), which transfers vital data between software programs.[4]
In the year 1986, Teknekron had a consulting project with Goldman Sachs to develop computer driven stock trading.[6][7] In 1987, the first TIB –  for the integration and delivery of market data such as stock quotes, news and other financial information –  went live at Fidelity Investments, followed by First Interstate Bank and Salomon Brothers, eventually digitizing all of Wall Street.[8] Teknekron's software bus programming allowed data to be shared between computers using different languages and different applications.[9] Wall Street trading firms used the software for trading systems, and eventually, large-scale manufacturers employed the technology as well.[10] Ranadivé said, "We digitized Wall Street. You had 20 television monitors that you had to look at. What we did was get rid of all that and replaced it with a Sun workstation. All of that information could now be treated as digitized information."[11]
In December 1993, Reuters Holdings PLC bought Teknekron Software Systems Inc. for $125.1 million in cash.[5]
Initial public offering[edit]
In 1997, Ranadivé founded TIBCO (The Information Bus Company).[12][13] The bus software allowed communication within the financial markets to happen in real-time and without human intervention. The technology was used by companies like SAP, IBM, and Oracle.[4] Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 of Microsoft's partners in "push" technology, which delivers internet content to users for free through web browsers.[14]
Before going public, an analyst promoted it.[15] The company's initial public offering (IPO) of stock was made in July 1999 with a range value of $9 to $11.[16] In its first day of trading, the company's stock doubled, from $17.38 to $32.38 per share[17][18] and in early 2000, the company's value went from $22.75 to $244.88 per share, its record high at the time.[19] After the IPO, the company raised $109.5 million and 7.3 million common shares sold for $15 each, above its range value.[20]
In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed using TIBCO Software that allowed companies to develop customized communications between computers.[11] Corporate Yahoo contained early examples of bundled e-mail, calendars, stock prices, and news displayed on intranet homepages. Hewlett-Packard was one of the partners in the software's development.[21]
Post-IPO[edit]
The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among USA Today's e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom.[22] During the first and second quarters of 2001, the firm's market capitalization approached $2 billion.[23][24]
In 2002, Verity, Inc., an American business portal infrastructure software provider, announced an expanded alliance with the company to integrate Verity K2 Developer technology with TIBCO ActivePortal 4.0 to better meet the needs of their customers.[25]
In 2003, British mobile operator Vodafone and Indian mobile provider Reliance Communications began using the firm's software, and Delta Air Lines used TIBCO software to organize its operation systems, including baggage handling, ticketing and check-in.[26][27] The same year, Lufthansa also used their software and Deutsche Bahn used it to construct digitally integrated train stations.[28][29]
In 2004, Wellpoint and RealMed used TIBCO technology to process HIPAA claims,[30] and Harrah's casinos used predictive software to analyze system demands.[31] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Allstate Insurance used its programming to process insurance claims.[32] Since its release in 2007, Apple's iPhone has used their software to process user requests and facilitate sales.[33] Xcel Energy launched its SmartGridCity program in 2009, which provided assistance to companies seeking to reduce carbon emissions, while using TIBCO software.[34]
By 2011, the company's annual revenues had grown to $920 million, its customer base to 4,000, and its number of employees to 2,500.[35][36][37][38] In March 2013, TIBCO announced that had chosen LaunchSquad as its corporate PR Agency of Record.[39]
In September 2014, TIBCO revealed it was being bought out by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion.[40]
On December 5, 2014, the acquisition of TIBCO by Vista Equity Partners was completed.[41] Murray Rode was made the CEO of TIBCO.
Products[edit]
The company's infrastructure software focuses on real-time communication for business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee data transfers,[1][42] including facilitation of communication between otherwise incompatible software.[43] The company provides middleware, which allows for access to real-time data between multiple systems while predicting users' needs.[44] The software appears in Amazon.com's personalized product recommendations, and FedEx's package tracking system.[44] Clients also use the software's feedback to deliver special offers to customers based on their browsing habits.[23]
TIBCO ActiveMatrix is a technology-neutral platform for composite business process management (BPM) and service-oriented architecture (SOA) applications. The platform includes products for service creation and integration, distributed service and data grids, packaged applications, BPM and governance.[45]
TIBCO ActiveSpaces is a distributed elastic peer-to-peer transactional datastore based on the tuple space concepts. It stores, retrieves and queries data stored into Spaces and distributes changes to that data in real-time in a true 'push' manner. It can function as an alternative datastore (with ACID properties and query filtering criteria expressed as SQL-compatible strings), messaging system (or a combination of the two), processing large amounts of data in a distributed manner.
TIBCO BusinessEvents is complex event processing (CEP) software to identify meaningful patterns across a business by correlating massive volumes of data with discrete events and applying predefined rules to identify situations that require a response.
TIBCO Enterprise Message Service is a standards-based messaging platform (fully TCK certified to both the JMS 1.1 and 2.0 standards)[46] that simplifies and accelerates the integration and management of data distribution in high-performance, enterprise environments.
TIBCO FTL is a low-latency messaging technology for electronic trading, using high performance algorithms on massively multi-core machines.[47]
TIBCO LogLogic makes a Computer appliance that IT system administrators, compliance managers, CIOs and Chief information security officers can use to collect logs and events from network devices, servers, databases, operating systems and applications.
TIBCO MDM is master data management for aligning enterprise data across multiple business units, departments and partners, synchronizing the information with downstream IT transactional systems.[48]
TIBCO MFT is managed file transfer for secure exchange of data and files using standards based protocols, across heterogeneous environments, that simplifies, provides visibility, and improves integration.
TIBCO Rendezvous a message bus for enterprise Application integration (EAI) with a messaging API in several programming languages. This solution uses broadcast/multicast notification.
TIBCO Hawk is a software product that allows monitoring and management of distributed computing applications.
TIBCO Spotfire is an analytics and business intelligence platform for analysis of data by predictive and complex statistics.[49][50] During the 2010 World Cup, FIFA used this software to give viewers analytics on country teams' past performances.[51] Among its components is the TIBCO Enterprise Runtime for R, a runtime engine for the R programming language, which was added in September 2012 as part of Spotfire 5.0.[52]
TIBCO tibbr, announced in January 2011, is a social media system for the workplace.[53] It manages input and output feeds to outside programs and integrates with other social media platforms.[53] Sixty companies, encompassing 50,000 users, have signed up.[54][55] tibbr 3.0, launched in June 2011, added HD video conferencing, and distinguishes between public and private information sharing.[56][57][58]

In the year 1986, Teknekron had a consulting project with Goldman Sachs to develop computer driven stock trading.[6][7] In 1987, the first TIB –  for the integration and delivery of market data such as stock quotes, news and other financial information –  went live at Fidelity Investments, followed by First Interstate Bank and Salomon Brothers, eventually digitizing all of Wall Street.[8] Teknekron's software bus programming allowed data to be shared between computers using different languages and different applications.[9] Wall Street trading firms used the software for trading systems, and eventually, large-scale manufacturers employed the technology as well.[10] Ranadivé said, "We digitized Wall Street. You had 20 television monitors that you had to look at. What we did was get rid of all that and replaced it with a Sun workstation. All of that information could now be treated as digitized information."[11]
In December 1993, Reuters Holdings PLC bought Teknekron Software Systems Inc. for $125.1 million in cash.[5]
Initial public offering[edit]
In 1997, Ranadivé founded TIBCO (The Information Bus Company).[12][13] The bus software allowed communication within the financial markets to happen in real-time and without human intervention. The technology was used by companies like SAP, IBM, and Oracle.[4] Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 of Microsoft's partners in "push" technology, which delivers internet content to users for free through web browsers.[14]
Before going public, an analyst promoted it.[15] The company's initial public offering (IPO) of stock was made in July 1999 with a range value of $9 to $11.[16] In its first day of trading, the company's stock doubled, from $17.38 to $32.38 per share[17][18] and in early 2000, the company's value went from $22.75 to $244.88 per share, its record high at the time.[19] After the IPO, the company raised $109.5 million and 7.3 million common shares sold for $15 each, above its range value.[20]
In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed using TIBCO Software that allowed companies to develop customized communications between computers.[11] Corporate Yahoo contained early examples of bundled e-mail, calendars, stock prices, and news displayed on intranet homepages. Hewlett-Packard was one of the partners in the software's development.[21]
Post-IPO[edit]
The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among USA Today's e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom.[22] During the first and second quarters of 2001, the firm's market capitalization approached $2 billion.[23][24]
In 2002, Verity, Inc., an American business portal infrastructure software provider, announced an expanded alliance with the company to integrate Verity K2 Developer technology with TIBCO ActivePortal 4.0 to better meet the needs of their customers.[25]
In 2003, British mobile operator Vodafone and Indian mobile provider Reliance Communications began using the firm's software, and Delta Air Lines used TIBCO software to organize its operation systems, including baggage handling, ticketing and check-in.[26][27] The same year, Lufthansa also used their software and Deutsche Bahn used it to construct digitally integrated train stations.[28][29]
In 2004, Wellpoint and RealMed used TIBCO technology to process HIPAA claims,[30] and Harrah's casinos used predictive software to analyze system demands.[31] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Allstate Insurance used its programming to process insurance claims.[32] Since its release in 2007, Apple's iPhone has used their software to process user requests and facilitate sales.[33] Xcel Energy launched its SmartGridCity program in 2009, which provided assistance to companies seeking to reduce carbon emissions, while using TIBCO software.[34]
By 2011, the company's annual revenues had grown to $920 million, its customer base to 4,000, and its number of employees to 2,500.[35][36][37][38] In March 2013, TIBCO announced that had chosen LaunchSquad as its corporate PR Agency of Record.[39]
In September 2014, TIBCO revealed it was being bought out by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $4.3 billion.[40]
On December 5, 2014, the acquisition of TIBCO by Vista Equity Partners was completed.[41] Murray Rode was made the CEO of TIBCO.
Products[edit]
The company's infrastructure software focuses on real-time communication for business-to-business, business-to-consumer and business-to-employee data transfers,[1][42] including facilitation of communication between otherwise incompatible software.[43] The company provides middleware, which allows for access to real-time data between multiple systems while predicting users' needs.[44] The software appears in Amazon.com's personalized product recommendations, and FedEx's package tracking system.[44] Clients also use the software's feedback to deliver special offers to customers based on their browsing habits.[23]

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
In 1985, Teknekron Corporation, a technology incubator, provided $250000 in seed capital to Vivek Ranadivé.[4] In 1986 Teknekron Software Systems was founded, and in 1987, spun off into an independent company.[5] The company's principal innovation was a software product known as the Teknekron Information Bus (abbreviated as TIB), which transfers vital data between software programs.[4]
In the year 1986, Teknekron had a consulting project with Goldman Sachs to develop computer driven stock trading.[6][7] In 1987, the first TIB –  for the integration and delivery of market data such as stock quotes, news and other financial information –  went live at Fidelity Investments, followed by First Interstate Bank and Salomon Brothers, eventually digitizing all of Wall Street.[8] Teknekron's software bus programming allowed data to be shared between computers using different languages and different applications.[9] Wall Street trading firms used the software for trading systems, and eventually, large-scale manufacturers employed the technology as well.[10] Ranadivé said, "We digitized Wall Street. You had 20 television monitors that you had to look at. What we did was get rid of all that and replaced it with a Sun workstation. All of that information could now be treated as digitized information."[11]
In December 1993, Reuters Holdings PLC bought Teknekron Software Systems Inc. for $125.1 million in cash.[5]
Initial public offering[edit]
In 1997, Ranadivé founded TIBCO (The Information Bus Company).[12][13] The bus software allowed communication within the financial markets to happen in real-time and without human intervention. The technology was used by companies like SAP, IBM, and Oracle.[4] Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 of Microsoft's partners in "push" technology, which delivers internet content to users for free through web browsers.[14]
Before going public, an analyst promoted it.[15] The company's initial public offering (IPO) of stock was made in July 1999 with a range value of $9 to $11.[16] In its first day of trading, the company's stock doubled, from $17.38 to $32.38 per share[17][18] and in early 2000, the company's value went from $22.75 to $244.88 per share, its record high at the time.[19] After the IPO, the company raised $109.5 million and 7.3 million common shares sold for $15 each, above its range value.[20]
In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed using TIBCO Software that allowed companies to develop customized communications between computers.[11] Corporate Yahoo contained early examples of bundled e-mail, calendars, stock prices, and news displayed on intranet homepages. Hewlett-Packard was one of the partners in the software's development.[21]
Post-IPO[edit]
The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among USA Today's e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom.[22] During the first and second quarters of 2001, the firm's market capitalization approached $2 billion.[23][24]
In 2002, Verity, Inc., an American business portal infrastructure software provider, announced an expanded alliance with the company to integrate Verity K2 Developer technology with TIBCO ActivePortal 4.0 to better meet the needs of their customers.[25]

Vivek Ranadivé, tech entrepreneur, to help UC fund innovations

1 / 1


Back to Gallery
















University of California researchers are so prolific — inventing ways to use mushrooms for powering cell phone batteries or to breed seeds tailored for organic farming, for example — that they have outpaced the amount of capital available for turning their creativity into products for sale. 
So the university announced Tuesday it has enlisted a celebrity entrepreneur from Silicon Valley, Vivek Ranadivé, to head a new investment fund so that researchers can access the cash they need to bring their ideas to market — and return the profits to UC. 



Latest news videos




 
Ranadivé, 58, brought Wall Street into the digital world in the 1980s, has founded software companies, and owns the Sacramento Kings basketball team. He’s also a former co-owner of the Golden State Warriors.
UC will seed the as-yet-unnamed fund with $250 million, while Ranadivé said he will contribute 5 percent of the fund.
“We have the ability to influence the California economy and address the world’s great problems,” UC President Janet Napolitano said of the brain power across the university’s 10 campuses. “What we have not had consistently is the ability to accelerate into the marketplace the ideas in our labs by our students and faculty. They’ve had to go out on their own to find capital, and I’d venture to say some have not succeeded.”
The new fund will create a “ready pipeline” for inventors in such fields as medicine, agriculture, energy and technology, Napolitano said.
It is also expected that profits from UC companies will create a pipeline of additional revenue for the monster-size pension system that UC has struggled to fully fund, and for other UC needs.
UC researchers already invent an average of five new products a day and have started about 800 companies selling everything from brain-training apps to otoscopes that clip onto a phone and let parents send a picture of a sick child’s inner ear to their doctor.
“UC is the feeding ground for a lot of (startups) even today,” said Ranadivé, who has two children who are UC graduates. 
But UC researchers won’t be the only beneficiaries of the fund, which will “seek compelling opportunities outside of UC by leveraging my vast network,” Ranadivé said. “Our mission is to help grow companies that will help advance society and make the world a better place.”

Vivek “real-time” Ranadive could just be the Peter Drucker of the 21st century. While Mr. Drucker and later Tom Peters’ management principles helped reform the global business landscape, Mr. Ranadive is preaching a new technology mantra – real-time computing – that promises to revolutionize the way global giants conduct commerce.
While management principles are nice in theory, Mr. Ranadive is proposing a new technology – event driven computing. Mr. Ranadive, who happens to be founder and chief executive of Tibco Software, a Palo Alto-based $3 billion in market capitalization and $319 million in 2001 sales company, that he has written a book on the topic, The Power of Now.

The Power of Now explains how companies use real-time information to anticipate and instantly respond to the ever-changing tide of new opportunities and new business strategies. Mr. Ranadiv provides a model in which corporations develop and deliver superior goods and services for their customers through a continual dialog with them. And all of this happens as quickly as possible, thanks to real-time technology for the Internet and the enterprise.

He sees a world which imitates the NASDAQ stock exchange ? like the traders responding to the events like demand for certain shares, or stock’s movement to news related to a particular company, say for example Juniper Networks. He believes that companies should be responding to the changing ¶chaos of business¾ today in such a manner as well. New information about bloated inventories should result in real-time discounts on products or special offers to customers. Mr. Ranadive describes this as zero-lag, ¶cash-to-cash¾ business, where the time delay between cash spent on producing goods, and the cash received from customers is nearly zero.

Oh he can talk about this for hours, and sitting in the trendy new bistro, Tamarind, in the soign Gramercy Park area in New York, the ideas pour from Mr. Ranadive like champagne flowing out of a bottle of Moet, after it has been shaken, stirred and uncorked. Literally talking at ¶mile-a-minute¾ Mr. Ranadive proposes a whole new efficient world empowered by new technologies. Of course like all true chief executives he talks about the magnificent opportunity it offers for his company.
¾We could be a company which supports a $100-billion ecosystem,¾ he boasts, betting that large corporations in industries as diverse as technology, financial services, and healthcare would but Tibco’s ¶middleware¾ software which makes corporation ¶real-time.¾
I first met Mr. Ranadive when researching for my cover story on real time computing, which was eventually published in the July 2001 issue of Red Herring (go to Generation Now gets up to speed) It has been a year since we talked about improving efficiencies in the corporation and every single time we have met, he points out how close we are towards a more real-time corporation.
The key to his “real time” vision is Tibco’s software which the pundits and technology guru’s describe as “new middleware.” This software is like the glue which ties together all old legacy applications like SAP, Siebel or Great Plains, and gives it a web-makeover and adds event-based rules which help a company better utilize all the information that flows in from its sales channel, employees and partners. Thanks for this software Mr. Ranadive has a captive audience of his own ? his company’s software helps manage transactions equaling trillions of dollars and counts more than 400 of the world’s largest banks and financial institutions as its customers. ¶Oh my only competition in this market is IBM,¾ he says.
Born in Mumbai, 43 summers ago, Mr. Ranadive came to the US to pursue a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at MIT, and later went to Harvard Business School to pursue his MBA. But it was not up until he started Tibco, that his vision of a real-time world started becoming a reality.
One thing about Mr. Ranadive is that he is relentless ? he has been preaching this mantra for almost two decades, and now his vision is beginning to find a receptive audience in the technology universe. Many venture capitalists have come to a similar conclusion and have beginning to shovel money into start-ups that are building software and related products that bring the world closer to a “real time enterprise.” Many start-ups have come forward with their own versions of a Real Time enterprise, including KnowNow, which has been funded by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and counts Rohit Khare, a big shot in the web world.
Not worried about any competition, Mr. Ranadive is now busy talking about a world where the refrigerator order milk when the supply runs low, and the devices decide where to buy electricity in real-time so that you do not have pay huge electricity bills. Sounds far fetched, doesn’t it? Well I was excused from pointing that out for Mr. Ranadive expresses an almost child-like delight at ¶bhel-puri¾ which arrived on our table. And of course since Tamarind is a fashionable place, this was the best bhel-puri both of us had ever seen ? and got busy eating.Generation Now gets upto speed

Vivek Ranadive – Hoop-Ball                 All posts tagged "Vivek Ranadive"Report: Kings owner Vivek Ranadive attended Otto Porter pitch meetingKings majority owner Vivek Ranadive attended the pitch meeting for restricted free agent Otto Porter on Sunday according to beat writer Ben Standig.This will likely make the locals in Sacramento cringe as his involvement in basketball decisions has been a major issue in the past and gauging his involvement in future decisions is always on everybody’s minds in Sacto. Can also confirm Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé attended the Porter pitch meeting, per source. https://t.co/0KeXWa6UVm— Ben Standig (@BenStandig) July 2, 2017     Vivek told Buddy Hield ‘we’re still going to get you’ in prior visits to SacramentoBuddy Hield had his first media appearance after practice on Wednesday in Sacramento, and he relayed a story about how Kings owner Vivek Ranadive approached him while he was a member of the Pelicans.Video can be found here from News 10 in Sacramento.“Vivek always — when I came in here the past two times, he always talked about ‘we always be pushing hard for you and but we’re still gonna get you.’  I was surprised about him saying that but now when I saw I was going to Sacramento and I say oh these guys are really serious about me.”Setting aside the issue of whether or not an owner should be approaching another team’s player like that — as well as the potential for Hield to be relaying the story in a way that doesn’t accurately capture the friendly banter — it’s not going to do anything for the perception that Vivek is still making basketball decisions.Our sources have indicated that Vivek indeed did have influence over the basketball decision and other reports have echoed that.It’s the decision-making process in Sacramento that has come under the most scrutiny over the past few days, and it will continue to do so until the product on the court improves significantly.And until basketball people are the only ones in Sacramento handling the decisions, that’s not likely going to be the case.     Geoff Petrie comments on Vivek RanadiveEarlier this week, Sam Amick of USA Today posted a two part interview with Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive in which he spoke about his first few years with the Kings, talking about the challenges that he faced and attempting to explain some of the decisions that have been questioned during his tenure. (For reference, here are the links to part one and part two of that interview.)Doing the interview and speaking about past mistakes was not necessarily a bad idea.  It should be noted that being the owner of an NBA franchise is not easy, and for that reason some mistakes are expected.With the team committing to Vlade Divac and Dave Joerger, the goal should be to convince fans that the team is heading toward stability.  Much has been made of Sacramento’s inability to stick to a direction, whether that be with the front office or the coaching staff, so coming out and recognizing where they’ve gone wrong while also mentioning the steps that have been taken to improve could have been a good move for the organization.Unfortunately, this isn’t the direction that Ranadive took during the interview.  He assessed blame, and very rarely took responsibility for his role in the dysfunction.  Considering the number of people that were involved in the situations discussed in the interview, it wasn’t surprising that somebody spoke up to respond to his comments.Geoff Petrie was the first to respond to some of the claims.  Petrie was the general manger of the team during the sale, and was involved for a short period of time after Randive took over.  During his interview with Amick, Ranadive had this to say about that time period:“Look, you’ve got to hire the GM and then the coach. But I also went to some – and I don’t want to name them – but I went to some very smart people for advice, and they said, ‘Hey, Malone is great. We like Malone.’ Sam, that practice facility was empty. I had the draft was going to start, and players were going to come in for tryouts. There was nobody there. I needed somebody to go and actually work out the players. Nobody wanted to there. (incumbent general manager) Geoff (Petrie) didn’t want to be there. The coach (Keith Smart) didn’t want to be there. There was nobody there.”He certainly didn’t hold back with his comments.  Ranadive was criticized heavily for hiring Michael Malone before hiring a general manager, and this quote was an attempt to explain that decision.  In Ranadive’s version of the story, the team needed help leading up to the draft, which fueled the Malone hiring.  This makes sense if the current front office wasn’t willing to be involved in the process.This part of the interview clearly angered Petrie.  In a separate interview with Kevin Draper of Deadspin, Geoff Petrie spoke about his time with the team after the sale. Petrie began by saying that Ranadive wasn’t exactly honest in his retelling:“The main reason I reached out, [the interview] is long and covered a lot of territory, but when it comes to some of the representations about myself and Keith Smart and the management group that was there at that time, it was basically totally untrue, what was represented there.”This doesn’t look good at all.  Lying about past mistakes only adds fuel to the fire, and Ranadive certainly hasn’t earned the benefit of the doubt here. Petrie then offered his version of what happened:“we had a group of people there that had been there, and we had worked together for a long time and were part of the best heritage that the Kings have ever had in Sacramento. I brought everybody together at different occasions and said, “Look, we’re going to be professional here, we’re going to continue to work like we’d work any other year, we’ll prepare for the draft like we would every other year, and ultimately we will assist any new people that may come in here and try and make them comfortable and get them situated.”This is certainly not the way that Ranadive describes the situation, and makes it seem like the team could have been patient in their search for a new general manager.  According to Petrie, they could have been even more patient when looking for a coach:“The way it came across in the article is like [Ranadivé] came in there and there was nobody there, nobody wanted to be there. Keith Smart wanted to be there! He had a year left on his contract. He didn’t get a discussion or an interview, he got a 90-second phone call in his car that they weren’t going to keep him.”The idea that Keith Smart wasn’t interested in continuing as the head coach didn’t sound right in the first place, and this seems to be a more likely scenario. Head coaching jobs aren’t easy to come by, and the fact that Smart was willing to be involved during the Maloof era would suggest that he would’ve been open to giving the new group a chance.This may not be the final response.  Many people were discussed during the interview, and some of them may follow in Petrie’s footsteps. Ranadive may even choose to comment again, especially considering the harsh nature of Petrie’s words.  Ranadive was discussing some sensitive topics, so it will be interesting to see how this story develops.

The Oklahoma product's NBA career hasn't gotten off to a Curry-esque start, however, as he averaged just 8.6 points on 39.2 percent shooting and 2.9 rebounds per game with the Pelicans.Comparisons of Hield and Curry date back to the former's senior year in Norman, which was one of the best single-season shooting performances in recent NCAA history. Hield averaged 25.0 points and 5.7 rebounds while knocking down four threes per game and winning the John R. Wooden Award for the nation's best college basketball player.The Sooners reached the Final Four largely on the back of Hield's individual excellence, which included a 36-point outing in the round of 32 and 37 points in the Elite Eight, before eventual champion Villanova knocked them out. With Curry in the midst of rewriting the NBA's record book and Hield soaring to stardom, the comparisons were somewhat natural.Like Hield, Curry stayed in college until he was an upperclassman. His huge scoring outbursts also served as a preview for his NBA ascent—including some notable moments leading underdog Davidson to the Elite Eight in 2008. Heading into the draft, some scouts questioned Curry's ability to create shots off the dribble because of his reliance on screens in college.Buddy Hield vs. The CurrysPPGRPGAPGeFG%Win Shares/48Buddy Hield8.62.91.448.6.018Steph Curry (Rookie Season)17.54.55.953.5.077Seth Curry (2016-17)11.72.62.756.3.100Basketball-Reference.comThat, however, is where the comparisons end. Curry was a three-year star at Davidson. Hield was a good role player during his freshman season at Oklahoma and would have been a borderline first-rounder had he come out after his junior year. His glimpses of true superstardom did not come until his senior year.And while comparisons between the two were somewhat understandable a year ago, Hield's NBA production to date has not hinted at that type of potential. Hield has been wildly inconsistent, beginning as one of the league's worst major rotation players before settling into erratic averageness of late.Opponents outscored the Pelicans by 7.0 points per 100 possessions with Hield on the floor this season, per Basketball-Reference. New Orleans has narrowly outscored opponents with him on the bench.At this point, Hield compares unfavorably to Seth Curry, the former undrafted brother of Steph who has become a fine rotation player with the Dallas Mavericks. Ironically, Seth spent time with the Kings last season, but Sacramento allowed him to walk in free agency rather than re-sign him.RelatedNBAReport: Melo Set on Rockets After Kyrie Trade RequestAlec Nathanvia Bleacher ReportNBANew Knicks GM Says He Hasn't Yet Met James DolanAlec Nathanvia Bleacher ReportNBAWiz Give Wall $170M ExtensionJoseph Zuckervia Bleacher ReportNBAReport: NYK Mulling Melo, Picks for KyrieAlec Nathanvia Bleacher Report
