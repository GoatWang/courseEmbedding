Award recognizes those who have had significant impact on New Jersey's technology industry






Shrewsbury, NJ (PRWEB)
November 25, 2015
 Wayside Technology Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:WSTG) today announced that Simon F. Nynens, the company’s Chairman, President & CEO, has been honored by the New Jersey Technology Council (NJTC) as the recipient of the Martinson-Ballen Technology Supporter award. This award recognizes individuals who have had significant impact on New Jersey's technology industry. The award was presented on November 19, 2015 at the NJTC Awards Celebration in Iselin, NJ.
The 2015 New Jersey Technology Council Awards Celebration honors New Jersey's top technology companies and their leaders for their business accomplishments in technological collaboration, partnership and innovation. Each year the NJTC selects an elite group of companies and individuals to receive these coveted awards.
“I can't think of a more deserving individual to win the 2015 Martinson-Ballen technology supporter award,” said Maxine Ballen, founder of the NJTC and previous CEO and President of the organization. “Simon has been walking the talk and talking the walk since his first encounter with the NJTC over a decade ago. He truly encompasses the definition of an entrepreneur who understands the value of getting involved in the community.”
“Serving three terms as Chairman, Simon advanced NJTC by improving successful programs and adding new opportunities for members,” said John Martinson, co-founder of the NJTC and Managing Partner, Edison Venture Fund. “His enthusiastic leadership has sustained NJTC as the primary advocate for our state’s technology industry.” 
“Simon has helped New Jersey's best to become better leaders, innovators and role models,” added Virginia Alling, Managing Director, PNC Bank.  “Working with Simon has been an enlightening experience.”
"This award is truly an honor," stated Simon F. Nynens. "I feel privileged to have been Chairman of one of the largest technology councils in the United States for three terms. Wayside Technology Group will remain actively involved as a member of the council, and I will continue to serve on the executive committee of the NJTC board of directors. We are excited about our future and continue to work hard every day to support the technology community.”
A graduate of the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School and a former auditing executive at Ernst & Young, Mr. Nynens has spent time with New Jersey’s business incubators and technology groups talking candidly about his own experiences to help business founders avoid the same pitfalls. Mr. Nynens received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2011 New Jersey Award in the Technology Services category. In recognition of his dedication to the industry, the New Jersey Technology Council had also named Mr. Nynens CEO of the Year in 2012, and he was subsequently honored for his work mentoring technology entrepreneurs throughout New Jersey in July 2014 when he was named to The Star-Ledger Inside Jersey’s 2014 “100+ Club,” a compilation of the most influential people in New Jersey.
