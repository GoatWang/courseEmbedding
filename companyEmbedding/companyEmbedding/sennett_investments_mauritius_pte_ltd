Temasek Holdings Sells Huaneng Renewables Shares

							July 22, 2013 

Singapore’s Temasek Holdings sold its entire 5.34% stake in Huaneng Renewables Corporation Ltd, a China-based developer focused on wind power.  Major energy distribution problems have surfaced as China has a challenging time transmitting wind-powered energy from the Northern generating regions to the Southeast coastal sections of the country.  Chinese wind power developers posted lackluster financial results in the first half of 2012.
