Career


Career1
2014 marked MacDonell’s 21st consecutive
season with over $2 million earnings.​


MacDonell won the Peaceful Way Stakes in both 2013 and
2014 behind the John Bax trained fillies Riveting Rosie and Stubborn Belle.


MacDonell had a solid 2011 campaign, visiting the winner’s circle 125 times.  His biggest win of the year was in the $239,801 Champlain Stakes with Big Mcdeal.


On November 13, 2010, OSS Super Final night, MacDonell surpassed $100 million in lifetime earnings. He guided Watermelonwine to a second-place showing and had two thirds with L A Freeway and Windsun Galaxie.


Also in 2010, MacDonell won the Cam Fella Series with Sixdaysontheroad, the Ontario Spring Series in an upset with Mambo Italiano on a sloppy Woodbine track in 1:54.1 and the Snowshoe Series with Giddy Up Delight in a stakes record time of 1:52.2.


In May 2010, MacDonell had his European debut with Define the World, a John Bax trainee.  Define the World came third in Norway’s $500,000CDN Oslo Grand Prix. A race that goes a mile and three-eighths.


On October 20, 2010, the beloved Admirals Express, who was regularly driven by MacDonell, was euthanized due to a leg injury.  The Grey Gladiator was later voted the 2010 recipient of the Cam Fella Award.


MacDonell enjoyed the ride of a lifetime in 2008, as he partnered with Canadian and US Horse of the Year, Somebeachsomewhere, to international acclaim.


With MacDonell in the bike, three-year-old pacer Somebeachsomewhere (Mach Three – Wheres The Beach) captured the $1.5 million Pepsi North America Cup, the Burlington Stakes, the Simcoe Stakes, the Confederation Cup at Flamboro Downs, divisions of the Bluegrass and Tattersalls Stakes at the Red Mile, the Messenger Stakes at Yonkers Raceway, and the Ontario Sires Stakes Super Final, capping off the unparalleled season with a triumph in the Breeders Crown at The Meadowlands.  The colt’s only career loss was in the $1.1 million Meadowlands Pace in July, when he yielded to Art Official in what is considered by many to be his grittiest performance.  MacDonell and Somebeachsomewhere earned over $2.5 million in 2008 for the Schooner Stables of Bible Hill, Nova Scotia, and more than $3.3 million in total over two years and 21 starts.  


Somebeachsomewhere shattered a total of four world speed records in 2007 and 2008, culminating in matching the all-ages pacing record of 1:46.4, set by Holborn Hanover.  The time also shattered the world record for three-year-old pacing colts.


MacDonell finished out 2008 with an O’Brien Award as driver of the year, his first win in three nominations.


MacDonell swept the Celias Counsel Trotting Series at Woodbine in April 2007, with Conway Maid.


Among his other 2007 successes, MacDonell partnered with rookie pacing sensation, Somebeachsomewhere, to defeat nine rivals in the $1 million Metro Pace in September and set a new juvenile world record of 1:49.3; he also captured three divisions of the Ontario Sires Stakes Super Finals in November.


Finished the 2007 season at the top of the standings among WEG drivers in purses earned ($3.2 million), sixth in UDRS (.239), and fourth in number of wins.


He celebrated his 4,000th career victory on December 29, 2006 with Darren McCall trainee, Warrawee FlareMacDonell was nominated for his second O’Brien Award in 2007, losing out to Jody Jamieson.


MacDonell put together an unbelievable year in 2005 and just missed receiving an O’Brien Award as Canada’s Driver of The Year (Mark MacDonald just edged him out).


In 2005, he won the both the Metro Pace and Governor’s Cup at WEG with Jeremes Jet before capturing the Breeders Crown at the Meadowlands with the son of Western Hanover.


With MacDonell at the lines, Jeremes Jet would go on to earn over $1 million in purses in 2005 and be named both a WEG and O’Brien Award winner in his two-year-old pacing colt class.


In 2005, MacDonell co-owned and drove two-year-old trotting colt Was It A Dream, who would go on to be named the WEG and O’Brien Award winner in his class.


One of MacDonell’s top drives, Admirals Express, aka ‘The Grey Gladiator’, was retired after his 2005 campaign; he was both the sport’s fastest grey performer (p,9,1:48.2[s]) and the horse with the most sub-1:50 victories (14), calling it quits with 76 career victories and over $2 million in purses.


In 2004, Invitro won 12 of 18 races and over $1 million in purses en route to being named both WEG’s Three-Year-Old Pacing Filly and Horse of The Year.


In 2003, MacDonell went on an 11-race win streak with JR Mint, who was the standout in the three-year-old pacing colt division at the time.


Another 2003 highlight came on July 10, when he won six races on the night’s card, including four in a row.


He had a memorable night on October 24, 1998, when he won three divisions of the Canadian Breeders Championships.


MacDonell drove a number of brilliant performers for the late Hall of Fame trainer William Wellwood (who helped kick-start his career) including such champions as Village Connection, Village Jiffy, Village Jasper and Rustler Hanover.


In 1990, MacDonell pulled off the biggest upset in Breeders Crown history when he guided home 69-1 longshot Bays Fella over prohibitive favourite Topnotcher.


MacDonell put together an unbelievable year in 2005 and just missed receiving an O’Brien Award as Canada’s Driver of The Year (Mark MacDonald just edged him out).


In addition to Bays Fella, Duke Of York and Jeremes Jet, he also has Breeders Crown triumphs with Lifetime Dream, Village Jiffy and Village Jasper.


His first win was with Dandy J Mite at Kawartha Downs in 1981.

Campbellville, ON --- Nine years after coming together to win the Pepsi North America Cup with the great Somebeachsomewhere, the Schooner Stables and Paul MacDonell team up again with Lawrencetown Beach, a lightly raced son of Somebeachsomewhere, in Saturday’s (June 10) Cup eliminations.Unraced at two, Lawrencetown Beach qualified for the first time back in February and made his pari-mutuel debut in March with eyes set on a solid 3-year-old season and potential North America Cup appearance. Over the course of four months, the bay gelding has competed mainly in overnight events at Woodbine and Mohawk, picking up two victories and $28,570 earned over eight starts.  New Image Media photoLawrencetown Beach has picked up two victories and $28,570 earned over eight starts.“He had some chips that were bothering him as a 2-year-old,” trainer-driver Paul MacDonell said. “Originally, the vets thought that he would be fine with them still in, but they just plagued him through the season. It got to a point where he couldn’t go with them so we laid him off and they were removed.”Missing his entire 2-year-old season came with pros and cons for Lawrencetown Beach.“He might be a bit fresher than most of the others, but he’s not as experienced,” MacDonell said. “The 2-year-olds that raced definitely have a touch of experience over him, but there are advantages both ways I suppose. It kind of evens itself out -- would you want a horse entering fresh or a horse with experience? It’s six of one, half a dozen of the other; really depends on the horse.”Lawrencetown Beach scored the first win of his career in his fifth outing, beating maiden company at Mohawk in 1:53.1. He followed that effort with a nine length romp against non-winners of two in a lifetime-best mile of 1:52.2.“When the owners made a payment on the North America Cup, I thought that was an extreme long shot,” MacDonell said. “But here we are -- he has just improved week after week; every time he raced he seemed to be better. Confidence seems to be coming to him, too. He’s right on schedule. He grew to be a muscular colt and he has all the tools he needs.”Competing in a division of the Somebeachsomewhere Stakes a week ago, Lawrencetown Beach rallied to finish second after being caught first over for most of the mile. “I knew he was coming up to a big race, and I still think he’s coming up to some big races,” MacDonell noted. “The colt has shown me progression or else we wouldn’t be where we are. He’s been drawing really well -- there’re a lot of things going his way right now. He has some kind of touch that’s been helping him along as he goes.”Lawrencetown Beach will start from post one in the first of three C$50,000 eliminations for the Pepsi North America Cup, drawing in against world champion Downbytheseaside. “He definitely has the potential to make the final,” MacDonell said. “There are probably three or four horses that are probably above everybody else (in the division). And then there’s the next group of colts, which he probably fits into. “I think you’re going to see Huntsville and (Downbythe)seaside and Fear The Dragon and maybe another one that are just a touch better than the rest. But he’s definitely in the mix.”While reaching his full potential in time for the Pepsi North America Cup might be a stretch, MacDonell thinks the future is very bright for Lawrencetown Beach.“I think you’ll see a nicer horse later on,” MacDonell said. “By this time next year, he should be an even stronger colt. He may not be right at his peak yet, but when he is, he’ll be a top horse I believe.”For more information on the Pepsi North America Cup and all the festivities, visit www.NorthAmericaCup.com.Here are the full fields for the Pepsi North America Cup eliminations.North America Cup – Elimination 1 (Race 3)Post – Horse (Driver – Trainer)1.
