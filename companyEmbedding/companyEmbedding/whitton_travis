Alistair Whitton
At Travis Pastrana’s House

“Yo dudes!  We just took a trip to Travis Pastrana’s house last week to session Nate Wessel’s latest build.”

“It is hands down the best park I’ve ever ridden.  It has a massive bowl with a few jumps around the outside…”

“…and a massive 50ft jump over the bowl.  So crazy!”
– Alistair Whitton
