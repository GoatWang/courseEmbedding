The CSL Behring Difference

        CSL Behring is a specialty biotherapeutics company. For more than a century, we
        have been serving people around the world who have serious medical conditions.

        Biotherapies differ from conventional pharmaceuticals. They are derived from human
        blood plasma or are manufactured using recombinant technologies. Conventional pharmaceuticals
        generally are derived from chemicals.

        CSL Behring develops, manufactures, and markets protein-based therapies in the following areas:
      







Bleeding Disorders Therapies > 




Fluid Replacement Therapies >                
 




Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Therapies >                
   




Immunoglobulin Therapies >               
             





Pulmonary Therapies >               
 




Wound Healing Therapies > 




        CSL Behring is proud to serve communities of people who have von Willebrand disease
        (VWD), hemophilia, primary immunodeficiency (PID), hereditary Angioedema (HAE),
        fibrinogen deficiency, genetic emphysema, and other rare diseases. Our biotherapies
        can also prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn, and prevent or stop bleeding
        in emergencies or planned surgery.

        CSL Behring is passionate about saving lives and about improving the quality of
        life for people with rare diseases.

        Product availability varies from country to country, depending on registration status.
        Please contact your CSL Behring representative for more information.

                    CSL : Employer Identification Number Registry














            This Directory Contains 2017 Employer Identification Numbers



            A business needs an EIN in order to pay employees and to file business tax returns. 
            To be considered a Partnership, LLC, Corporation, S Corporation, Non-profit, etc. a business must obtain an EIN. 
            Those business that do not are considered proprietorships and the Owner / Operator SSN is used on any tax documents. 
            Also, financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and brokerage houses will not open an account for a corporation without an EIN.

CSL Capital Management, LLC



CSL Capital Management, LLC


Locke Lord represented CSL Capital Management, LLC (CSL) in two recent acquisitions from related companies Bayou Workover Services, LLC and Bayou Well Services, LLC (together, Bayou).  CSL is a Houston-based private equity firm focused on oilfield services companies.
In the first transaction, Allied Energy Services, LLC (Allied), a newly-formed portfolio company of CSL, acquired all of the pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing assets of Bayou.  The acquisition of these assets by Allied increases the scope of offerings of CSL’s well completions platform.  Financial terms were not disclosed. David Lange (Dallas) led the Locke Lord transaction team, with assistance from Matt Stockstill, Van Jolas, Geoff Polma, Susan Rainey, Kim Williams, Masae Ellis, Marc Lipscomb and Danielle Olson (all of Dallas), Karl Fryzel (Boston), Ed Razim (Houston), and Victoria de Lisle (New Orleans).
In the second transaction, CSL portfolio company Ranger Energy Services, LLC (Ranger) acquired the well services, well workover, fluid management, well completions and snubbing operations and related equipment rental operations of Bayou.   The transaction also included the contribution to Ranger of another company recently acquired by CSL – Magna Energy Services, LLC.  The combination of these two acquisitions with Ranger expands Ranger’s geographic coverage and diversifies the well services company’s offerings.  Financial terms were not disclosed.  Matt Stockstill (Dallas) led the Locke Lord transaction team, with assistance from David Lange, Andrew Betaque, Van Jolas, Geoff Polma, Susan Rainey, Kim Williams, Nathan Crow, Masae Ellis, Marc Lipscomb, Danielle Olson and Matt Olson (all of Dallas), Karl Fryzel (Boston), Ed Razim and Laura Ferguson (both of Houston).  For more information, please see the CSL press release.

CSL Capital Management Announces Sale of PyraMax Ceramics, LLC to Imerys S.A. | Business Wire
























































CSL Capital Management Announces Sale of PyraMax Ceramics, LLC to 
      Imerys S.A.






April 11, 2013 02:18 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A consortium led by CSL Capital Management, LLC announced today it has 
      sold PyraMax Ceramics, LLC (“PyraMax”) to Imerys S.A. for a total 
      consideration of USD 235 million and additional payments of up to USD 
      100 million, subject to meeting certain industrial and commercial 
      performance criteria. PyraMax is in the final stages of completing a 
      state-of-the-art, 500 million pounds per year manufacturing facility 
      comprised of two production lines located in Wrens, GA.
    

      Imerys’ acquisition of PyraMax, added to its current production 
      capacity, will significantly enhance its ability to supply high-quality 
      ceramic proppant to the fast-growing North America non-conventional oil 
      and gas market.
    

Charles S. Leykum, Founder of CSL Capital Management and Chairman 
      of PyraMax Ceramics, LLC, said “Our management team has done a great job 
      building PyraMax from a greenfield project to near commercial operation. 
      We are excited to work with Imerys, a well-established player in this 
      sector, and think the combination will create a robust supplier to the 
      proppants industry. We wish Don and his team continued success.”
    

Don Anschutz, President of PyraMax Ceramics, LLC, said “CSL has 
      been an invaluable partner and resource for us and we enjoyed working 
      with them. Their experience building companies and vision for PyraMax to 
      be a state-of-the-art ceramic proppant plant was essential to our 
      success. Joining Imerys will accelerate that vision and give us access 
      to expertise and resources that will increase our ability to anticipate 
      and exceed our customers’ expectations.”
