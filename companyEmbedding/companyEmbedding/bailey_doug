About AMS



Our Mission
The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers programs that create domestic and international marketing opportunities for U.S. producers of food, fiber, and specialty crops. AMS also provides the agriculture industry with valuable services to ensure the quality and availability of wholesome food for consumers across the country.
Nearly 4,000 AMS professionals work every day to support the country’s diverse agricultural operations, which range from individual farmers to international businesses and employ 1 in 12 people. AMS services and its millions of dollars in annual grant investments also create opportunities by supporting economic development in small towns and rural communities that stand as the backbone of American values.
Much of the agency’s support for agriculture is provided through commodity-specific efforts, such as its Dairy; Specialty Crops; Livestock, Poultry and Seed; and Cotton and Tobacco Programs. AMS also oversees the National Organic Program; Science and Technology Program; and the Transportation and Marketing Program.  AMS also provides regulatory oversight for over 20 research and promotion programs, and enforces other Federal regulations such as the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) and the Seed Act.
Our History
In 1939, Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace consolidated a number of bureaus and programs to create a single agency to carry out a sweeping mission.  The new Agricultural Marketing Service was charged with facilitating the efficient, fair marketing of U.S. agricultural products, including food, fiber, and specialty crops.
Over the last 78 years, AMS has evolved to support American farmers, ranchers, importers, exporters and many other facets of the agricultural industry.

Motocross Legends of the Road to Race Across America David Bailey, Doug Henry, Micky Dymond and Jeff Ward will embark on cross-country cycling race on Saturday, June 17

OCEANSIDE, Calif. – The Road2Recovery Legends of the Road – David Bailey, Doug Henry, Micky Dymond and Jeff Ward – are in the final days of preparing for the competition of a lifetime: the 2017 Race Across America (RAAM), which will take them more than 3,000 miles from Oceanside, Calif. to Annapolis, Md. over the course of six to eight days starting June 17. 
The team will cycle across the country in a race against time, traversing major climate changes as they pass three major mountain ranges (Sierra, Rocky and Appalachian), cross four of America’s longest rivers (Colorado, Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio) and pass through the Mojave Desert, Sonoran Deserts, Monument Valley and the Great Plains, in a test of mental and physical stamina like no other.
Bailey (55), Henry (48), Dymond (52) and Ward (55), The Legends of the Road, are not your typical competitors. Among them, they’ve earned multiple AMA Supercross/Motocross champion titles, World Champion titles and Motorcycle Hall of Fame inductions. But their accolades as athletes are not what sets this team apart; it’s the fact that half the team will be competing in the RAAM on hand cycles.
David Bailey and Doug Henry both suffered spinal cord injuries while doing what they loved. Bailey was injured in January of 1987 while practicing for the upcoming Supercross season, at a track in Lake Huron, Calif. There was significant spinal cord damage, and he became paralyzed from the chest down. Almost 20 years later in March of 2007, Henry broke his back while racing in a Supermoto race. He now suffers partial paralysis from the waist down. While this might break the spirits of some, these two strong competitors and athletes have used their injuries to inspire others. In 1997 Bailey started training for the Hawaii Ironman triathlon. In his first two attempts, he finished in third place, then second; finally in 2000 he became Ironman World Champion in his division, 13 years after his accident. Seven years after Doug Henry’s injury he competed and won third place at Winter X-Games 14, in the “Adaptive Snowmobile” class. 
After watching Micky Dymond and his team of four race RAAM back in 2014, Bailey became inspired to do the same. He wanted to put together a team of athletes, and his goal was much greater than winning: “My hope is both to inspire and raise additional money for athletes who need a boost to get going again,” Bailey said. “Road2Recovery helped me back in 2007 when I was in bad shape physically and financially. It’s the least I can do to demonstrate how much it helps when you have that extra boost and motivation to be at your best”. 
The team chooses to carry on the tradition of the name “The Legends of the Road” in tribute to Micky’s first RAAM team – comprised of Dymond, Dave Mirra, Ben Bostrom and Dave Zabriskie – that raced in 2014, winning the four-person team category. The late Dave Mirra coined the team name and this new group of Legends hopes to do it justice this year and carry on the name for many years to come.

Oh my… I don’t know where to start.  We’ve been looking forward to this wedding since they announced their engagement last year.  I don’t want to go into too much detail about how special these two are and just how amazing they are together since this is just the preview, but Saturday was without a doubt the most perfect day for the most perfect couple.  Congrats Bailey and Doug – we love you guys!

It’s also the people who catered to their needs for 3070 miles (MXA even had a test rider in the crew—John Perry, fourth from left in back row).Team: David Bailey, Micky Dymond, Doug Henry, Jeff WardPlace: Second in four-man team (50-59)Distance: 3070 milesTime: 7 days, 19 hours, 58 minutesAverage speed: 16.33 mph averageFinish: City Dock, Annapolis, MarylandFrom www.road2recovery.com: A truly unique team of racers crossed the line at City Dock to take second in the four-rider age 50-59 category. These athletes are all “Legends” in every sense of the word. All are retired from one of the most grueling and physically demanding sports there is and come to RAAM with a legion of loyal fans from all over the world.But these four aren’t known for their ultra-cycling. These guys all had highly successful careers in motocross and Supercross, sports where men ride 240-pound, 60-horsepower machines over treacherous terrain that taxes their strength, stamina, skill and endurance. Many will be surprised that sports trainers regard top-level motocross racers to be among the most conditioned athletes of any sport. And as with most of the top motocross riders, these guys used cycling in their training and all have deep knowledge and respect for cycling.Founding member of the team Micky Dymond is a two-time 125cc Motocross Champion, former Supermoto champion, and a member of RAAM 2014’s winning 4-rider team, the “Legends of the Road.” Micky’s RAAM effort kindled an interest in one of the biggest names and most-loved champions of U.S. motocross, David Bailey, a 250cc and 500cc champion whose career ended when he was paralyzed in a 1987 racing crash. He later went on to be a highly competitive physically challenged triathlete with several top finishes and a victory at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii. Together the two recruited another fan favorite, Jeff Ward, the only motocross racer to win the 125cc, 250cc, 500cc and Supercross championship. After he retired from motocross Ward had a successful auto-racing career, the highlight of which was a second place finish in the 1999 Indianapolis 500.The fourth member was Doug Henry, winner of a 125cc Supercross championship, a 125cc motocross championship and a 250cc motocross championship, who after retiring from motocross kept his competitive fire going in Supermoto events, where he unfortunately suffered a paralyzing crash. Bailey and Henry rode hand-cycles custom-built by Dan Gurney Racing while Dymond and Ward rode standard bicycles.These four men who were once fierce and competitive rivals teamed up for the 3,070-mile test of determination and will that is RAAM for themselves and for Road2Recovery. The Road 2 Recovery Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded to help professional AMA-licensed Motocross/Supercross members with financial assistance if they sustain career-ending injuries as well as providing motivational, emotional, and spiritual support to these individuals and their families. www.road2recovery.com Tags DAVID BAILEY, DOUG HENRY, jeff ward, legends of the road, micky dymond, motocross, RAAM, RACE ACROSS AMERICA, ROAD2RECOVERY, SUPERCROSS Pin It Tweet Related ArticleMXA TIME MACHINE: WHAT WASHOUGAL LOOKED LIKE ...Jul 26, 2017Comments off6 ViewsIt was 125s and 500s back in 1991FIRST LOOK!
