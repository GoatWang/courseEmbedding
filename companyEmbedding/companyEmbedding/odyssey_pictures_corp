DALLAS, April 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Odyssey Pictures Corporation (OTCQB: OPIX) (Odyssey), a publicly traded media and entertainment company, announces it has recently appointed two new members to its board of directors; Ralph Boral and Henrik Ljung.Â  Mr. Ljung replaces Dan Persson, who has retired from the board.
Ralph Boral has a deep background of senior media and entertainment industry experience in both production and finance.
He was Director of Finance and Producer of Special Events for NBC News Channel from 1988 to 1989. Â Â He then took over the affiliate feed service for Fox News, where he produced numerous feature segments and a news series for affiliate stations.Â  He later joined The Film Foundry, a production studio, where he oversaw budgets and negotiated rights and distribution deals.Â  He eventually took over operations of GlueWorks Animation, The Film Foundry's animation division.Â  Mr. Boral now serves as Odyssey's Chief Operating Officer and Executive in Charge of Production.Â  He is the producer of Odyssey's current animated feature film project "Hank the Cowdog."
Henrik Ljung brings extensive experience in media, finance and marketing to the board.Â  He is founding partner of Ampezzo Partners LLP, a private equity fund specializing in growth stage online media and marketing businesses.Â Â  From 2008 to 2011 Ljung was CEO of Siguiente Capital AB, a small venture capital investment firm focused on IT and telecom innovation.Â  From 2005 through 2008, he was head analyst online investments for that firm.Â Â Â  Mr. Ljung has a Masters degree in Management from University of St. Andrews (UK).Â  He has studied at the Lubin School of Business and the Universite de la Sorbonne.
Â "Ralph and Henrik are vital new additions to our board at a time when the company is moving to the next level of our business plan," remarked Odyssey's CEO John Foster.Â  "We are already benefiting greatly from their collective expertise in production and finance." 
About Odyssey Pictures Corporation - Initially an entertainment company focusing on financing and distribution of first run feature films, Odyssey has adapted its business model to become a diversified media/marketing services company.Â  The company's lines of business now encompass producer's representation, branding & marketing and IPTV digital delivery technologies.Â  Odyssey's Producer's Representative Service provides an extensive suite of sales and marketing services to independent filmmakers seeking to gain traction in the international distribution and rights markets.Â  These services include international sales, contract negotiation, marketing materials, strategic planning and completion financing. http://odysseypix.com/
Forward-Looking Statements - Certain statements contained herein are forward looking. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from these statements, including our history of operating losses, our need for additional financing, a failure of our products to perform as expected, introduction of competing products by other companies, pressure on prices from competitors and/or customers, regulatory obstacles to new product introductions, lack of acceptance of our products, and technology changes. Â These risks, uncertainties and assumptions are detailed in documents filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive. Any forward-looking statements are made as of the date of the document in which they appear. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the company. â¨
