GPU-accelerated analytics database for real-time insights on large and streaming datasets
 




 



Kinetica harnesses the power of GPUs for unprecedented performance to ingest, explore and visualize data in motion and at rest.
 
 
 






Proven at Enterprise Scale

 
 
 











Kinetica Secures Series A Investment of $50 Million : More »
 
 
 











GPU hardware acceleration is revolutionizing high performance computing. Kinetica's GPU database is redefining what is possible with data and analytics.
 
 
 






Incredibly Fast
The GPU parallelized processing architecture not only enables near-linear scalability, it also reduces analytical processing times for multi-billion row data sets by more than 100x compared to leading in-memory and analytical databases.
 
 
 





Aggregate Queries








Leading In-Memory DB
> 50x Slower


NoSQL DB’s
> 100x Slower


Time for an aggregate of queries (s)
Less is better!














 
 
 






Artificial Intelligence and Business Intelligence CONVERGED ON A GPU-ACCELERATED DATABASE
GPUs are well suited for the types of vector and matrix operations found in machine learning and deep learning. In-database processing on Kinetica opens the way for machine learning and artificial intelligence libraries such as TensorFlow, BIDMach, Caffe, Torch and others to work directly on data within Kinetica.

 PLAY GPU-Accelerated Advanced In-Database Analytics Architecture
Now AI workloads can run together on the same GPU-accelerated database platform as BI operations. Doing so makes it possible to quickly deploy new models and eliminates the time and effort required to transform data and move it back and forth between a database and a separate data science system.
 
 
 






Ideal for Location-Based Analytics
Kinetica comes with a native geospatial and visualization pipeline; for rendering large volumes of data over maps. This makes Kinetica particularly well suited for fast moving, location-based IoT data. Kinetica includes Reveal – an extensible and flexible web-based analytics visualization framework. You can also connect Kinetica to other BI tools such as Tableau and MicroStrategy via ODBC/JDBC.

Distributed In-Memory Architecture
Kinetica is a distributed, columnar, relational database designed for analytics on large and streaming datasets. Tiered memory management allows data to be held in VRAM and system memory, with persistence to disk. 
 
 
 




SQL, REST API, and more...
Kinetica's SQL query capabilities enable business users to be immediately productive without learning new languages or systems. The native REST API and associated connectors provide data scientists a robust tools for interacting from Python, Node, Java, C++ and more.
 
 
 




Secure with High Availability
Enterprises rely on Kinetica's mature security framework and high availability architecture for mission-critical workloads. Multiple replicas of data eliminate single points of failure, and provide an eventually consistent data store with recovery capability.

Developed to meet the intelligence needs of the US Army
Kinetica was built to meet the needs of US Army Intelligence and Security Command—to track and analyze terrorist and other national security threats in real time. The solution was launched within the military in 2012 and was made commercially available in 2014.
It’s literally battle tested.

Kinetica Db, Inc. Key Developments

Fuzzy Logix, Inc. and Kinetica to Provide Enhanced GPU-Accelerated In-Database Analytics
May 8 17
Fuzzy Logix, Inc. announced a partnership to offer a joint solution that will allow customers of both companies to leverage high performing advanced analytics with acceleration of 100-500x on 1/10th the hardware over CPU-only based solutions. The joint solution will initially be targeted at the most time-sensitive and compute-heavy applications in financial services, retail, and healthcare, where speed and scale are critical for real-time data insights and competitive advantage. By combining technologies, Kinetica’s in-database analytics capabilities will be extended by hundreds of additional GPU-accelerated and highly-parallelized, machine learning and predictive analytics algorithms from Fuzzy Logix. At the same time, those analytic functions will now also be able to take full advantage of Kinetica’s distributed GPU pipeline via its User Defined Functions. Analytics and data science teams using the joint solution will have access to a rich library of algorithms on a SQL-compliant, in-memory database that leverages the GPU’s massive parallelization and brute force compute for real-time analytics. Use cases include computing portfolio risk management, options and equity pricing, product-based inventory optimization, next-likely purchase, prescribing habits of physicians and care gap analysis. Under the terms of the agreement, the joint solution will be available as a premium offering from Kinetica. The combined offering will make it easy for customers to acquire and get support from a single provider, whether deployed in on-premises, cloud, or a hybrid architecture. The first set of algorithms will be available by the third quarter of 2017.

History[edit]
In 2009, Amit Vij and Nima Neghaban founded GIS Federal, a developer of software they called GPUdb. The GIS stood for Global Intelligence Solutions. GPUdb was initially marketed for US military and intelligence applications, at Fort Belvoir for INSCOM.[1]
The United States Postal Service deployed GPUdb in to production 2014.[2][3]
In 2014 and 2016, the analyst firm International Data Corporation mentioned Kinetica for its production deployments at the US Army and United States Postal Service, respectively. As a result of their work with USPS, IDC announced that Kinetica was the recipient of the HPC Innovation Excellence Award [4] [5]
On March 3, 2016, the name of the company was changed to GPUdb to match the name of the software, and a $7 million investment was announced which included Raymond J. Lane.[6] In September 2016, it announced another $6 million investment, and an office in San Francisco, while keeping its office in Arlington, Virginia. After adding marketing and service people, the name of both the company and product was changed to Kinetica.[7][8][9]
Software[edit]
The software is designed to run on graphics processing units such as the Tesla from Nvidia.[10] Partners include Cisco, Dell EMC, HPE, IBM, NVIDIA, Confluent, and Nimbix.[citation needed].[11]

In 2009, Amit Vij and Nima Neghaban founded GIS Federal, a developer of software they called GPUdb. The GIS stood for Global Intelligence Solutions. GPUdb was initially marketed for US military and intelligence applications, at Fort Belvoir for INSCOM.[1]
The United States Postal Service deployed GPUdb in to production 2014.[2][3]
In 2014 and 2016, the analyst firm International Data Corporation mentioned Kinetica for its production deployments at the US Army and United States Postal Service, respectively. As a result of their work with USPS, IDC announced that Kinetica was the recipient of the HPC Innovation Excellence Award [4] [5]
On March 3, 2016, the name of the company was changed to GPUdb to match the name of the software, and a $7 million investment was announced which included Raymond J. Lane.[6] In September 2016, it announced another $6 million investment, and an office in San Francisco, while keeping its office in Arlington, Virginia. After adding marketing and service people, the name of both the company and product was changed to Kinetica.[7][8][9]
Software[edit]
The software is designed to run on graphics processing units such as the Tesla from Nvidia.[10] Partners include Cisco, Dell EMC, HPE, IBM, NVIDIA, Confluent, and Nimbix.[citation needed].[11]

GPU database – designed from the ground up
to deliver truly real-time insights
GPU acceleration changes the game for fast data analytics, for location-based analytics and for predictive analytics
 





GPUs are designed around thousands of small, efficient cores that are well suited to performing repeated similar instructions in parallel. This makes them well-suited to the compute-intensive workloads required of large data sets.
Some of the latest high performance GPUs from NVIDIA feature over 4,000 cores, versus 16 to 32 cores per typical CPU-based device.
GPU cores crunch data far more efficiently and quickly than CPUs—which process data sequentially.

Why Another Database?  PLAY
 
 
 











So much raw compute power, you won't need to think about indexing, partitioning or downsampling!
 
 
 






Icon
Very Low Latency
With less to index, data is available immediately after it is written. No more waiting for data structures to be updated before the data can be returned in queries.
 
 
 




Icon
Ask any question
Since there is no need to prepare the schema before it can be explored, business analysts have complete flexibility and freedom for data discovery projects.
 
 
 




Icon
Linear Scale out
With simpler data structures, the database scales in proportion to the size of the data. This leads to smaller and more predictable hardware costs.
 
 
 






How GPU-acceleration enables faster and more flexible OLAP processing » 
 
 






Did we mention speed?
10x-100x faster than even the most advanced in-memory databases
 







In tests, Kinetica returns results for advanced analytical queries on billions of rows of data in well under a second.


Price/Performance : Download the White Paper »
 
 
 

 











Scale out on industry-standard hardware
The efficiencies of Kinetica's GPU architecture typically result in hardware costs that are 1⁄10 that of other in-memory databases.
As datasets grow, Kinetica is able to scale out across multiple nodes. Kinetica leverages the raw compute power of the GPU to break open processing bottlenecks and reduce reliance on indexes. In addition to performance benefits, customers experience dramatic efficiency gains. Kinetica sometimes requires just 1⁄10 of the hardware and 1⁄20 of the power when compared to other in-memory analytics solutions.
 
 
 







Kinetica runs on commodity hardware, that scales out linearly to meet your needs.
