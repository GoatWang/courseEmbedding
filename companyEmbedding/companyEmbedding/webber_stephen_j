History[edit]




Replica of the original 1951 Weber kettle grill


Weber-Stephen was originally incorporated on May 8, 1893 as Weber Bros. Metal Works.[3]
In 1951, the original round charcoal kettle grill was built by George Stephen Sr., a then part-owner of the sheet metal shop in Chicago [4] who sought to improve on the brazier he had been using to cook with at home.[5] The grill was produced using two sheet metal half-spheres normally used as parts of buoys built in his shop. Shortly thereafter he began selling the invention, which he called 'George's Barbecue Kettle', for which there was considerable demand.[6]
Because the grill became so successful after he began selling it in 1952, Stephen formed the barbecue division of the Weber Brothers factory. In the late 1950s, Stephen bought out the Weber Brothers factory and became the sole owner, devoting all his professional time to manufacturing and selling the Weber kettle. Soon thereafter, Stephen changed the company’s name to Weber-Stephen Products Co.[7]
The Weber-Stephen company manufactures and sells outdoor electric grills, charcoal grills,gas grills, and charcoal smokers.
Weber Grill Restaurants[edit]





Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago, Illinois





Weber Grill Restaurant in Schaumburg, Illinois





In 1989, the company opened the first Weber Grill Restaurant in Wheeling, Illinois, but in spite of a remodeling in 2000, this location closed in 2010.[8] Five additional locations were built in Lombard, Illinois (1999), River North, Chicago (2002), Schaumburg, Illinois (2005), Indianapolis (2007), and St.Louis (2016), all of which are in operation as of 2017.[9]
While a majority share of Weber-Stephen Products LLC was sold to BDT Capital Partners in 2010, the acquisition did not include restaurant operations. While both the restaurants and outdoor cooking equipment maintain the Weber branding, two separate companies now exist. The restaurants remain solely owned by the Stephen family.
Grill Academy[edit]
The Grill Academy is a day-long cooking school where attendees learn various barbecue cooking techniques. In the early 2000s, Weber-Stephen started testing the Grill Academy concept in European Markets, and expects to expand the scheme to the United States in 2016.
Ducane Products Co.[edit]
The Ducane Products Company started out as the Ducane Brothers Metal Fabricating in 1946. It moved three years later to Little Ferry, New Jersey, where they manufactured warm air furnaces. In 1968, the name was changed to The Ducane Company and moved the base of operations to Barnwell, SC. And in 1975, they started making Ducane Gas Grills.[10] However, Ducane filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and was partially acquired by Weber-Stephens at a bankruptcy sale in 2004 for $13.6 million.
Under Weber's leadership, Ducane marketed propane and natural gas grills through big box home improvement and specialty outdoor product stores. In an effort to revamp the Ducane brand, Weber introduced the "Ducane Stainless" (2006) exclusively through Home Depot, the "Ducane Affinity" (2007)and the "Ducane Meridian" (2007) through multiple channels.[11]

Weber-Stephen Products LLC announced the launching of new Weber Briquettes—the perfect partner for Weber's iconic charcoal grills and smokers. The new 20-lb. bags of Weber Briquettes, made from 100% all natural hardwood, provide a long, consistent heat—requiring less need to refuel during grilling. More importantly, Weber Briquettes are made from 100% all natural hardwood and do not include any unwanted chemical binders or fillers. The Weber Briquettes come in a weather-protected re-sealable bag that features a handy zip top to help protect charcoal from the elements. The new Weber Briquettes retail for $24.99 MSRP and are available where Weber grills are sold.


Weber-Stephen Products LLC Announces Introduction of New Genesis II
Apr 20 17
Weber-Stephen Products LLC announced the introduction of new Genesis II, an eight grill line-up that promises the grilling community an unparalleled backyard grilling experience. The Genesis II and Genesis II LX lines include eight gas grill models, with two, three, four and six-burner options. All models feature the new GS4 High Performance Grilling System featuring: new tapered burners that allow for even heat distribution; a 10-year warranty on Weber's new Infinity ignition system; Flavorizer bars to help reduce flare-ups; and a new center-located grease management system for faster, easier cleaning.

Weber Grills Launches New Charcoal Briquettes For "Big Game" Grillers
Jan 26 17
With the biggest football game of the year right around the corner, Weber Grills announced the launch of new Weber Briquettes—essential for the estimated 40% of U.S. grill owners who typically grill for the Big Game.  In stores now, the new 20-lb. bags of Weber Briquettes are made from 100%, all natural hardwood that does not include any unwanted chemical binders or fillers, produce less ash, and provide a long, consistent heat requiring less need to refuel during grilling—and more time to watch the game. The Weber Briquettes retail for $24.99 and come in a weather-protected re-sealable bag to help protect charcoal from the elements.

History[edit]




Replica of the original 1951 Weber kettle grill


Weber-Stephen was originally incorporated on May 8, 1893 as Weber Bros. Metal Works.[3]
In 1951, the original round charcoal kettle grill was built by George Stephen Sr., a then part-owner of the sheet metal shop in Chicago [4] who sought to improve on the brazier he had been using to cook with at home.[5] The grill was produced using two sheet metal half-spheres normally used as parts of buoys built in his shop. Shortly thereafter he began selling the invention, which he called 'George's Barbecue Kettle', for which there was considerable demand.[6]
Because the grill became so successful after he began selling it in 1952, Stephen formed the barbecue division of the Weber Brothers factory. In the late 1950s, Stephen bought out the Weber Brothers factory and became the sole owner, devoting all his professional time to manufacturing and selling the Weber kettle. Soon thereafter, Stephen changed the company’s name to Weber-Stephen Products Co.[7]
The Weber-Stephen company manufactures and sells outdoor electric grills, charcoal grills,gas grills, and charcoal smokers.
Weber Grill Restaurants[edit]





Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago, Illinois





Weber Grill Restaurant in Schaumburg, Illinois





In 1989, the company opened the first Weber Grill Restaurant in Wheeling, Illinois, but in spite of a remodeling in 2000, this location closed in 2010.[8] Five additional locations were built in Lombard, Illinois (1999), River North, Chicago (2002), Schaumburg, Illinois (2005), Indianapolis (2007), and St.Louis (2016), all of which are in operation as of 2017.[9]
While a majority share of Weber-Stephen Products LLC was sold to BDT Capital Partners in 2010, the acquisition did not include restaurant operations. While both the restaurants and outdoor cooking equipment maintain the Weber branding, two separate companies now exist. The restaurants remain solely owned by the Stephen family.
Grill Academy[edit]
The Grill Academy is a day-long cooking school where attendees learn various barbecue cooking techniques. In the early 2000s, Weber-Stephen started testing the Grill Academy concept in European Markets, and expects to expand the scheme to the United States in 2016.
Ducane Products Co.[edit]
The Ducane Products Company started out as the Ducane Brothers Metal Fabricating in 1946. It moved three years later to Little Ferry, New Jersey, where they manufactured warm air furnaces. In 1968, the name was changed to The Ducane Company and moved the base of operations to Barnwell, SC. And in 1975, they started making Ducane Gas Grills.[10] However, Ducane filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and was partially acquired by Weber-Stephens at a bankruptcy sale in 2004 for $13.6 million.
Under Weber's leadership, Ducane marketed propane and natural gas grills through big box home improvement and specialty outdoor product stores. In an effort to revamp the Ducane brand, Weber introduced the "Ducane Stainless" (2006) exclusively through Home Depot, the "Ducane Affinity" (2007)and the "Ducane Meridian" (2007) through multiple channels.[11]

Thoroughly loved coming to work every day.ConsThe HR dept is akin to a bunch of 8th grade girls and I seriously wonder if any of them have actual HR background. Many people have lost their jobs (lay-offs) over the last couple years, probably to help offset the increasing pay and incentives to bring on more V.P's of everything you could have a V.P. for. Way too top heavy now, and the family feel that was there when the Stephen family ran it, is a distant memory. Pay was not great, but the casual work environment made it ok. Benefits are extremely expensive compared to other companies.Advice to Management**Note to Glassdoor - Jim Stephen is NOT the CEO anymore and the 100% approval rating is for him, not the current CEO Tom Koos*** Knock the chip off your shoulder and listen to the folks that have been there 10, 20 or more years... the people on the line know a lot more than you think they do.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Weber-Stephen Products Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Weber-Stephen Products 2017-06-11 10:56 PDT Join the Weber-Stephen Products team See Our Latest Jobs Jun 8, 2017"Good for young people looking for a starte job"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Customer Service Representative in Palatine, ILCurrent Employee - Customer Service Representative in Palatine, ILDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Weber-Stephen Products full-time (Less than a year)ProsThe job is easy, and you get the backup from your peers.

Making Nachos on Go-Anywhere























THE BEST BBQ MEMORIES ARE MADE BY SHARING WONDERFUL MEALS

Inspired by his passion for grilling the best steaks for family and friends, Weber’s founder, George Stephen, invented the revolutionary kettle grill in 1952.
George knew that a rounded cooking bowl with a lid was the key to success. He added three legs to the bottom, a handle to the top, and the rest is history.
