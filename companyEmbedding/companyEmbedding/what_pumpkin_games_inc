        The craze wrought by the wild success of Starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte

Slide 1 of 12



’Tis the season (for pumpkin) The great pumpkin invasion has begun. Once again, America’s store shelves and restaurant menus are overflowing with pumpkin items — literally from soup to nuts (as in pumpkin soup and pumpkin spice peanut butter). Naturally, the trend has its roots in the runaway success that Starbucks has enjoyed with its pumpkin spice latte (or PSL, as the seasonal drink’s fans call it). In fact, the iconic beverage turns 10 in 2013 — and Starbucks is sure to add considerably to the 200 million PSLs it’s sold to date since the introduction. But if you’re looking for what else is new or noteworthy in pumpkin, we’ve done for the work. Here are 10 items to help you celebrate the season. — By Charles Passy 














Slide 2 of 12



 Pumpkin tea  Pumpkin spice: It’s not just for coffee anymore. In fact, it’s for tea. The proof: Tea retailer Teavana has come out with its Pumpkin Spice Brulee Oolong, billed as “a bountiful harvest of sweetness and spice,” featuring dried pumpkin pieces, green pumpkin seeds, white and dark chocolate, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice and nutmeg. (Oh, and yes, oolong tea leaves.) Another tea brand, Davidson’s, also has its Pumpkin Spice Tea — it suggests adding milk and sweetener to it to create a different kind of pumpkin latte. 














Slide 3 of 12



 Pumpkin air freshener  Sure, you can inhale the aroma of a pumpkin latte. But if you want that smell to stay in the air, Glade has got its limited-spice Pumpkin Spice Fragrance Collection, replete with everything from a pumpkin spice scented candle to a pumpkin spice automatic spray. With its hints of cardamom, nutmeg, ginger extract, crystallized caramel and molasses, the scent is described by the brand as “mouth-watering.” But Glade has competition in the pumpkin aromatherapy category: For example, Air Wick has its just released Acadia Sweet Vanilla & Pumpkins Spray.  














Slide 4 of 12



 Pumpkin tortilla chips  And you thought pumpkin snacks were limited to pumpkin seeds. The folks at Way Better Snacks have found a way to work pumpkin into a tortilla chip — specifically, its Oh, My Sweet Punkin’ Cranberry Tortilla Chips. The health-conscious brand notes that pumpkin is a “great source of vitamin A and fiber,” making this chip both “wholesome” and “a tasteful toast to the season.” Oh, and if you need some pumpkin salsa to go along with those chips, don’t worry: Celeb chef Rick Bayless has you covered with his Chipotle Pumpkin Seasonal Salsa.  














Slide 5 of 12



 Pumpkin cheese  Looking for another pumpkin topper for your chips — or for stand-alone snacking? Alouette, the brand associated with all things French and cheesy, has a Pumpkin Spice Spreadable Cheese — “perfect as an afternoon snack…or topped on pancakes for an easy Sunday brunch.” But Alouette isn’t alone in wedding pumpkin with cheese: The Federal, a Miami restaurant, now offers a roasted pumpkin mac ‘n’ cheese.  














Slide 6 of 12



 Pumpkin cannoli  Remember that classic “Godfather” line: “Leave the gun, take the cannoli”? Today, that would be “take the pumpkin cannoli.” Stuffed Artisan Cannolis, a New York-based bakery that specializes in the Italian pastry, offers its Pumpkin Pie Cannoli during the season. If cannoli sounds too fancy, there are plenty of pedestrian pumpkin sweets, including Homer Simpson’s favorite: doughnuts. Both Krispy Kreme and Dunkin’ Donuts have pumpkin-themed doughnuts available this season.  














Slide 7 of 12



 Pumpkin M&M’s  We have pretzel M&M’s, raspberry M&M’s and even an M&M’s Snack Mix. So why not a pumpkin M&M’s product? Sure enough, this year there’s M&M’s Pumpkin Spice, available through Target. If M&M’s are not your candy of choice, Jelly Belly has its own array of pumpkin chews. 














Slide 8 of 12



 Pumpkin bagel  You might want to hold off on the smoked salmon accompaniment, but, yes, there’s a pumpkin bagel — specifically, Panera Bread’s Pumpkin Pie Bagel. It’s almost a bagel-as-dessert affair, with a pumpkin-spice-cinnamon crunch topping (and if that’s not enough sweetness for you, Panera adds a sprinkling of powdered sugar). Panera has the savory pumpkin front covered, too — it just introduced Vegetarian Autumn Squash Soup made with butternut squash and pumpkin (and topped with roasted and salted pumpkin seeds). 














Slide 9 of 12



 Pumpkin beer  Pumpkin beers have become so popular they’re almost as much a cliché as pumpkin spice lattes. But Capital City Brewing Co., a chain of brewpub restaurants in the Washington, D.C., area, is trying to up the game with its Dr. Punkinstein — a pumpkin porter that also blends in chocolate and honey. If you’re looking for more pumpkin with an alcoholic kick, Margaritas Mexican Restaurant, a New England chain, has unveiled a Pumpkin Sangria, blending wine, pumpkin pie syrup, sugar, cinnamon-vanilla-flavored vodka and fruit. 














Slide 10 of 12



 Pumpkin facial mask  If there’s a big pumpkin trend in 2013, it’s pumpkin cosmetics. One example that caught our immediate eye: Michael Todd True Organics’ Pumpkin Facial Mask — pumpkin-y goodness that’s ready to be slathered on your skin. In this case, it’s a “nutrient rich” pumpkin blended with glycolic acid, all designed to “remove dead skin, impurities and toxins.” (And no, you can’t eat it.) If you’d rather not go through the hassle of applying a mask, you can opt for the straightforward alternative of a pumpkin soap — the YesterYear Soap Co. makes a Pumpkin Spice Bar Soap.  














Slide 11 of 12



 Blue pumpkin  Of course, if you really want pumpkin, you can skip the spice and just buy, well, a pumpkin. But if you’re going that route, why not opt for a very different sort of squash? FreshDirect, a New York-based grocery service, offers an edible blue pumpkin — a special variety grown on Rottkamp’s Fox Hollow Farm in Long Island. “Particularly fetching” is how the company describes it. We’d be hard-pressed to disagree.

Why waste your time?


            For the price, you may think... what do I have to lose? Alot. I wouldn't make my worst enemy play this game. Easy on achievements. Terrible at everything else. Save your money people

PUMPKIN YOGHURT
Unlike most pumpkin-spice items, Noosa's super-creamy Australian "yoghurt" is packed with actual pumpkin, making it a delicious option for people opposed to artificial spice flavors. (Note: It pained us to add an "h" to yogurt, just like it pained you to read it, but seeing as the yoghurt is Australian, we just have to try to respect it.)

Auntie Anne's


PUMPKIN SPICE PRETZEL NUGGETS
These buttery Auntie Anne's pretzel nuggets are coated in sweet spices. The best part? You can eat as many as you like, because mini versions of things don't have calories.

PUMPKIN SPICE PANCAKE MIX
Ah, autumn…the season when it's finally cool enough for us to crave warm pancakes, particularly of the pumpkin spice variety from Krusteaz.

Kelloggs


FROSTED MINI WHEATS PUMPKIN SPICE
The best part of the "first-ever nationally available pumpkin spice cereal" is the fact that it turns your milk into a sweet, spiced concoction that would probably taste delicious with a shot of espresso.

Nature's Path


PUMPKIN-N-SPICE GRANOLA BARS
For people who think they're better than pumpkin spice, maybe the added 'n' between the two words – plus the addition of flax and nuts – will make these Natures's Path bars a suitable fall time snack.

NESTLÉ PUMPKIN SPICE REFRIGERATED COOKIE DOUGH
If cookies-from-scratch seem too daunting, just pull apart these dough squares (with pumpkin purée and white chocolate chips already added in), bake, and devour.

Terra


PUMPKIN SPICE SWEETS CHIPS
Unlike most food products, Terra's sweet potato chips actually make sense to receive the pumpkin spice treatment of cinnamon and nutmeg, two flavors that pair nicely with the root vegetable.

PUMPKIN SPICE COFFEE LIQUEUR
Oh, all the spiking possibilities! We can imagine dousing a hot chocolate, mocha or chai tea latte with Kahlúa's new pumpkin spice coffee liqueur. Dare we even spike a pumpkin spice latte, or is that over-the-top?

PUMPKIN PIE BLIZZARD
To be fair, Dairy Queen's Pumpkin Pie Blizzards have been in the game since 1991 – long before pumpkin spice became a cultural phenomenon – but it's still worth including here. Why? Because the shake literally has pieces of pumpkin pie blended in it. That is all.

PUMPKIN SPICE INSTANT OATMEAL
The warm spices lend itself to a warm bowl of oatmeal, which is – by all accounts – easier than baking a pumpkin pie.
