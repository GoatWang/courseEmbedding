(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition of First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2017 (unaudited), as compared with December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016 (unaudited), and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 (unaudited), as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016 (unaudited). Management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Planned Acquisitions  During the first quarter of 2017, First Busey announced the signing of two definitive agreements to acquire First Community, headquartered in Joliet, Illinois, and Mid Illinois, headquartered in Peoria, Illinois. The acquisition of First Community will allow us to significantly expand our geographic presence into attractive southwest suburbs of Chicago. The acquisition of Mid Illinois will enhance the Company's existing deposit, commercial banking and trust and investment presence in the greater Peoria area.  Operating Results  First Busey's net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $15.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share. The Company reported net income of $11.5 million or $0.30 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2016 and net income of $10.4 million or $0.36 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2016. The results benefitted from the acquisition of Pulaski since the closing of the transaction on April 30, 2016.  During the first quarter of 2017, the Company incurred $0.7 million of pre-tax expenses related to the pending acquisitions, which primarily consisted of legal and professional expenses. Additional notable pre-tax items incurred by the Company during the first quarter of 2017 included $0.2 million of restructuring costs and an insignificant amount related to the Pulaski acquisition. Excluding these items, the Company's operating earnings, a Non-GAAP financial measure, for the first quarter of 2017 would have been $15.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share.  Revenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers' fees, and remittance processing activities represented 48.8% of the Company's non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, providing a balance to revenue from traditional banking activities.  Trust fees and commissions and brokers' fees increased to $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.2 million for the first quarter of 2016, with market expansion into St. Louis and strong performance from Busey Ag Services, a wealth management division of Busey Bank, producing positive results. Net income from the wealth management segment increased to $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2016.  Remittance processing revenue increased 5.5% on a linked quarter basis to $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, but decreased 2.7% from $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increases were primarily due to growth in online and mobile service revenues, with some offset to growth from the prior year based on customers lost through consolidation with other companies. Net income from the remittance processing segment was $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase from $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.5 million in first quarter of 2016.  Mortgage revenues slowed significantly and balances of loans held for sale decreased, supplemented with active cost reduction efforts and effective headcount management.  The Company produced growth in key areas in the opening months of the year, including commercial loans and non-interest bearing deposits, while net income in the banking, remittance processing and wealth management segments all grew on a linked quarter and comparative basis to the prior year. Credit metrics were also positive, with net recoveries recorded to the allowance for loan losses that drove lower provision expense, and solid gains in OREO - all indicators of ongoing balance sheet strength.  Asset Quality  While much internal focus has been directed toward growth, the Company's commitment to credit quality remains strong. The asset metrics reflect the post combination results of the Pulaski acquisition. As of March 31, 2017, the Company reported a decrease in non-performing loans to $20.9 million compared to $21.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Non-performing assets were 0.6% of total portfolio loans and non-performing assets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  The Company recorded net recoveries of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to net charge-offs of $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of portfolio loans increased to 1.3% at March 31, 2017 compared to 1.2% at December 31, 2016. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2016.  With a continued commitment to asset quality and the strength of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, near-term loan losses are expected to remain generally low. While these results are encouraging, asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market-specific economic conditions, and specific measures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  The key metrics are as follows (dollars in thousands):   As of and for the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2016 2016 Portfolio loans $ 3,872,952 $ 3,878,900 $ 3,807,613 $ 3,780,966 Commercial loans(1) 2,799,193 2,796,130 2,715,580 2,685,933 Allowance for loan losses 48,442 47,795 47,847 45,358 Non-performing loans Non-accrual loans 20,544 21,423 16,253 22,443 Loans 90+ days past due 311 131 3,830 334 Loans 30-89 days past due 9,804 4,090 7,709 9,754 Other non-performing assets 739 2,518 2,324 3,267 Non-performing assets to portfolio 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.7 % loans and non- performing assets Allowance as a percentage of 232.3 % 221.7 % 238.2 % 199.1 % non-performing loans Allowance for loan losses to 1.3 % 1.2 % 1.3 % 1.2 % portfolio loans  Economic Conditions of Markets  The Company has 28 banking centers serving Illinois. Our primary downstate Illinois markets of Champaign, Macon, McLean and Peoria counties are anchored by several strong, well-recognized and stable organizations. Champaign County is home to the University of Illinois - Urbana/Champaign ("U of I"), the University's primary campus. U of I has in excess of 44,000 students. Additionally, Champaign County healthcare providers serve a significant area of downstate Illinois and western Indiana. Macon County is home to the North American headquarters for Archer Daniels Midland ("ADM"), a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest agricultural processors in the world. ADM's presence in Macon County supports many derivative businesses in the agricultural processing arena. Additionally, Macon County is home to Millikin University, and its healthcare providers serve a significant role in the market. McLean County is home to State Farm, Country Financial, Illinois State University and Illinois Wesleyan University. State Farm, a Fortune 100 company, is the largest employer in McLean County, and Country Financial and the universities provide additional stability to a growing area of downstate Illinois. Peoria County is home to Caterpillar Inc. operations, a Fortune 100 company, and Bradley University, in addition to a large healthcare presence serving much of the western portion of downstate Illinois. The institutions noted above, coupled with a large agricultural sector, anchor the communities in which they are located, and have provided a comparatively stable foundation for housing, employment and small business.  The State of Illinois, where a large portion of the Company's customer base is located, continues to be one of the most troubled of any state in the United States with pension under-funding, a current budget impasse, continued budget deficits and a declining credit outlook. Additionally, the Company is located in markets with significant universities and healthcare companies, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. Payment lapses by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have negative effects on our primary market areas.  The acquisition of Pulaski expanded our presence into the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area, which is the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the twentieth largest in the United States. The bi-state metropolitan area includes seven counties in Missouri and eight counties in Illinois. The area is home to 19 Fortune 1000 companies, including Express Scripts, Emerson Electric, Centene and Monsanto. St. Louis has a diverse economy with its major employment sectors including health care, financial services, professional and business services, and retail. The Company has 13 banking centers serving the St. Louis metropolitan area, all of which are located in the city of St. Louis, or the adjacent counties of St. Louis County and St. Charles County. St. Charles County has been one of the fastest-growing counties in the country for decades. The county features a cross-section of industry, as well as extensive retail and some agriculture. The Company's geographic concentration in only three of the 15 counties included in the St. Louis metropolitan area gives the Company tremendous expansion opportunities into neighboring counties.  The Company has five banking centers in southwest Florida. Southwest Florida has shown continuing signs of improvement in areas such as job growth and the housing market over the last several years.  The Company has one banking center in the Indianapolis, Indiana area, which is the most populous city of Indiana with a diverse economy. Many large corporations are headquartered in Indianapolis and it is host to numerous conventions and sporting events annually. In 2017, the Company plans to expand its presence in Indianapolis.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE  Net interest income  Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees earned on earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate levels and volume fluctuations within earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest margin is tax-equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets.  Certain assets with tax favorable treatment are evaluated on a tax-equivalent basis. Tax-equivalent basis assumes a federal income tax rate of 35%. Tax favorable assets generally have lower contractual pre-tax yields than fully taxable assets. A tax-equivalent analysis is performed by adding the tax savings to the earnings on tax favorable assets. After factoring in the tax favorable effects of these assets, the yields may be more appropriately evaluated against alternative earning assets. In addition to yield, various other risks are factored into the evaluation process.  The following tables show our Consolidated Average Balance Sheets, detailing the major categories of assets and liabilities, the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, the interest expense paid for the interest-bearing liabilities, and the related interest rates for the periods shown. The tables also show, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest expense resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on changes due to rate and changes due to volume. All average information is provided on a daily average basis.

(3)Interest income includes a tax-equivalent adjustment of $0.7 million and $0.5 million at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  (4)Includes federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and revolving loan. Interest expense includes a non-usage fee on the revolving loan.  (5)Annualized.  Consolidated Average Balance Sheets and interest rates were impacted by the April 30, 2016 Pulaski acquisition. Total average interest-earning assets increased $1.2 billion, or 32.8%, to $4.9 billion for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $3.7 billion for the same period in 2016. Total average interest-bearing liability balances increased $854.2 million, or 31.2%, to $3.6 billion for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $2.7 billion for the same period in 2016.  Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased $14.2 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period of 2016. The Federal Open Market Committee announced on March 15, 2017 that the federal funds rate increased from 0.75% to 1.00%. The Company expects this increase in interest rates to be modestly favorable to net interest income in 2017. However, rising interest rates could result in decreased demand for first mortgages as well as mortgage refinancing, activities which contribute to a portion of the Company's mortgage revenue.  Net interest margin  Net interest margin, our net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets stated on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to 3.53% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 3.10% for the same period in 2016.  Quarterly net interest margins for 2017 and 2016 were as follows:   2017 2016 First Quarter 3.53 % 3.10 % Second Quarter - 3.32 % Third Quarter - 3.51 % Fourth Quarter - 3.63 %  The net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, also on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.44% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 3.05% for the same period in 2016.  Management attempts to mitigate the effects of the interest-rate environment through effective portfolio management, prudent loan underwriting and operational efficiencies. Please refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income and expense.  Non-interest income (dollars in thousands):   Three Months Ended March 31, $ % 2017 2016 Change Change Trust fees $ 6,190 $ 5,547 $ 643 11.6 % Commissions and brokers' fees, net 722 668 54 8.1 % Remittance processing 2,845 2,925 (80 ) (2.7 )% Service charges on deposit accounts 4,075 3,125 950 30.4 % Other service charges and fees 1,911 1,581 330 20.9 % Mortgage revenue 2,134 880 1,254 142.5 % Security gains, net 857 1,067 (210 ) (19.7 )% Other income 1,280 1,053 227 21.6 % Total non-interest income $ 20,014 $ 16,846 $ 3,168 18.8 %  Total non-interest income of $20.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 increased by 18.8% as compared to $16.8 million for the same period in 2016. The increases were primarily driven by the April 30, 2016 Pulaski acquisition.  Combined Wealth Management revenue, consisting of trust fees and commissions and brokers' fees, net, increased to $6.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $6.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The addition of these service offerings in the St. Louis markets is expected to provide attractive growth opportunities in future periods.  Remittance processing revenue of $2.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased slightly compared to $2.9 million for the same period of 2016. Remittance processing adds important diversity to our revenue stream while widening our array of service offerings to larger commercial clients within our footprint and nationally.  Overall, service charges on deposit accounts combined with other service charges and fees increased to $6.0 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $4.7 million for the same period of 2016. Evolving regulation, product changes and changing behaviors by our client base may impact the revenue derived from charges on deposit accounts.  Mortgage revenue increased to $2.1 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.9 million for the same period of 2016. The Company has historically held a leading position in its primary residential loan markets in Central Illinois, while the operations acquired from Pulaski have been ranked among the top residential mortgage loan producers in the St. Louis and Kansas City markets. Mortgage revenue increased significantly from the first quarter of 2016 principally from the additional mortgage activity contributed by the operations acquired from Pulaski. However, the first quarter of 2017 was influenced by a marked increase in mortgage rates and associated costs, as well as seasonally slowing home purchase activity and declines in purchase inventory when compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016.  Security gains, net, decreased for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Security gains, net, vary based on the Company's decisions around selling securities. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company sold 100% risk weighted investments and reinvested in 20% risk weighted investments at higher yields to better manage capital, while also producing higher future returns.  Other income increased 21.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 across multiple revenue sources.

Salaries, wages and employee benefits expense of $21.9 million increased $6.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the Pulaski acquisition.

Full-time equivalent employees totaled 1,251 at March 31, 2017, down from 1,295 at December 31, 2016, and up from 788 at March 31, 2016.  Combined net occupancy expense of premises and furniture and equipment expenses of $4.8 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, increased compared to the same period in 2016. The Pulaski acquisition added 13 full-service branches and several loan production offices. We continue to evaluate our branch network and operations for appropriate cost control measures while seeking improvements in service delivery to our customers.  Data processing expense for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 of $3.6 million increased from $3.2 million for the same period of 2016.  Amortization of intangible assets increased for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 as a result of the Pulaski acquisition.  . . .

	Companies that don't have any trademark applications are more likely to be stable, maintaining their existing business lines.
	Companies that are applying for new trademarks are likely to be investing in R&D and marketing, attempting to expand more rapidly or pivoting to reach strategic markets.
	Trademarks may include brand names, product names, logos and slogans.

Recession Risk
	IncFact analyzed data from the last recession to determine whether First Busey grew or shrank over that period. We also looked at other companies in the industry
	 to compare how recession-proof First Busey is relative to the industry. While a new recession may strike a particular industry, measuring the
	 industry and company's robustness during the last recession estimates its ability to weather future recessions.

	
Market Share of Competition: First Busey vs. Largest Competitors
		A competitive analysis shows these companies are in the same general field as First Busey, even though they may not compete head-to-head. 
		These are the largest companies by revenue. However, they may not have the largest market share in this industry if they have diversified into other business lines. 
		The "Competition" section of a business plan or investment memorandum would start by analyzing the information about these companies.
		Competitive advantage comes from offering better pricing or superior products/service.

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act of 1995
This release contains certain forward-looking statements within 
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 
21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. These include statements as to the 
benefits of the merger, including future financial and operating results, cost savings, 
enhanced revenues and the accretion/dilution to reported earnings that may be realized 
from the merger as well as other statements of expectations regarding the merger 
and any other statements regarding future results or expectations. First Busey Corporation 
intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions 
for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995 and is including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. 
Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe 
future plans, strategies, and expectations of First Busey Corporation, are generally 
identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," 
"estimate," "project," or similar expressions. First Busey Corporation's ability 
to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently 
uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations 
and future prospects of First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries include, but 
are not limited to: the risk that the businesses of First Busey Corporation and 
the former Main Street will not be integrated successfully or such integration may 
be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; expected revenue synergies 
and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the 
expected time frame; revenues following the merger may be lower than expected; customer 
and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; 
changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, 
monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. 
Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality and composition of the loan 
or securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; 
demand for financial services in the companies' respective market areas; their implementation 
of new technologies; their ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic 
systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties 
should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance 
should not be placed on such statements.News ReleasesDateTitle7/25/2017First Busey Announces 2017 Second Quarter Earnings7/03/2017First Busey Corporation Finalizes Acquisition of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. and First Community Financial Bank4/25/2017First Busey Announces 2017 First Quarter Earnings3/13/2017First Busey Corporation and Mid Illinois Bancorp to Merge2/06/2017First Busey and First Community to Merge1/26/2017First Busey Announces 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings and Full Year Results10/25/2016First Busey Announces 2016 Third Quarter Earnings7/28/2016First Busey Announces 2016 Second Quarter EarningsNews Releases7/25/2017First Busey Announces 2017 Second Quarter Earnings7/03/2017First Busey Corporation Finalizes Acquisition of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. and First Community Financial Bank4/25/2017First Busey Announces 2017 First Quarter Earnings3/13/2017First Busey Corporation and Mid Illinois Bancorp to Merge2/06/2017First Busey and First Community to Merge1/26/2017First Busey Announces 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings and Full Year Results10/25/2016First Busey Announces 2016 Third Quarter Earnings7/28/2016First Busey Announces 2016 Second Quarter EarningsContact InformationFirst Busey Corporation100 W.
