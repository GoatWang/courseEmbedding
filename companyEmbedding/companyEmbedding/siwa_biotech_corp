Business Identifier: Development of male non-hormonal contraceptive pill 
Public Profile: Siwa Biotech Corporation has developed technology leading toward a male non-hormonal "pill" form of contraception based on finding an inhibitor for the TPST 2 enzyme, which in animal models renders males infertile without any other side effects. Siwa Biotech Corporation is a spin-off from NovaZyme which was acquired by Genzyme. The spin-off is seeking to exploit its extensive portfolio of issued patents and proprietary knowledge about protein-tyrosine sulfation in order to develop treatments for serious diseases. Siwa is investigating the modulation of protein-tyrosine sulfation to treat a variety of diseases with unmet medical needs. In late 2007, ChemDiv, Inc., a leading chemistry-driven global contract research organization announced signing of a collaborative discovery research agreement with Siwa Biotech Corporation, Oklahoma City, OK. Under the agreement, ChemDiv will be initiating a high-throughput screen for small molecule inhibitors of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases. The collaboration provides Siwa Biotech with access to ChemDiv's expertise in chemistry systems and lead discovery.
