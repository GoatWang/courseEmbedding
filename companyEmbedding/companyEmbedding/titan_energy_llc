	Atlas Resource Partners LP (ARP) emerged from bankruptcy protection with a new name, Titan Energy LLC, after the company reached a restructuring deal with nearly all of its lenders and bondholders.

	Last July, ARP reached a deal to reduce its debt by $900 million in exchange for all of the common equity in Titan once it emerged from Chapter 11 (see Shale Daily, July 25). Under the deal, $668 million of ARP's outstanding senior notes were converted into 90% of Titan's common equity, while ARP's second lien lenders received the remaining 10% in Titan's common equity. ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group LLC (ATLS), now holds a 2% preferred member interest.

	The restructuring deal also called for the creation of a new senior secured credit facility of $440 million, with a redetermination that would be suspended until May 2017 as long as Titan met certain conditions. ARP said the remaining debt on its books would be cleared with the proceeds from selling its natural gas and oil hedge positions.

	"We are excited at what I consider to be a tremendous opportunity to grow meaningful value for all of Titan Energy's stakeholders," CEO Daniel Herz said in a statement. "I believe Titan is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the current energy environment."

	ARP said Titan's portfolio of oil and natural gas assets includes more than 14,000 gross wells in 17 states, which collectively produced an average 223 MMcfe/d in 2Q2016. The company added that as of July 1, Titan's estimated proved reserves totaled 1,013 Bcfe, of which 68% is natural gas and 71% are classified as proved developed producing. Also as of July 1, Titan's reserve report estimated the value of its reserves at $832 million.

	"Titan will continue to be, through its subsidiary, the leading sponsor and manager of tax-advantaged investment partnerships, through which it is able to monetize a portion of its undeveloped natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids production activities," ARP said.

View images from Titan Energy’s previous oil and gas production projects.





Titan’s mineral gallery features images and descriptions of valuable minerals.





Titan Energy, Inc. is a privately owned oil and gas exploration company based in Austin, Texas. The focus of the company’s activities is primarily oil production, although natural gas is many times produced in conjunction with oil and therefore is a valuable resource to exploit as well.

The Company’s basic philosophy and area of drilling concentration is to go into existing or previously producing shallow oil fields and then drill into deeper horizons in search of previously unexploited oil reserves.

Titan Energy’s primary area of drilling activity is the Eastern Shelf of the Midland Basin in Texas, although the company also has production in the Fort Worth Basin in north central Texas, and has been involved in drilling in numerous counties in the north and west Texas areas.
Click here to learn about the President of Titan Energy, David Paschal.
 







“Worldwide demand for energy is expected to double within the next 40 years.  The price of oil will most likely start to increase in 2016, and then embark on an upward trend as world supply and demand balance out.  The upside price could be quite high.”
- David Paschal, President, Titan Energy
