Even in a world where everything is increasingly paperless, sometimes there's no substitute for physical records. Folders are an essential part of any business's office supplies list and help prevent clutter from building up on your desk; keeping all of your vital paperwork organized. Tax records, contracts and insurance certificates are easy to access when you file them properly in a filing system, and pocket folders store class materials like syllabi, exam study questions and homework.
Long-Term File Storage
Law firms, accountants and tax preparers need to store thousands of files for clients and regulatory purposes. File storage boxes have removable lids and heavy-duty cardboard construction so you can keep them indefinitely in a storage room or onsite archive. Plastic file totes are waterproof and keep out pests like mites, moths and silverfish so your most important records remain pristine. Plastic crates with wing lids and locking lids prevent mildew and mold from infiltrating paperwork in damp environments.
File Folders for Quick and Easy Access 
Keep all of your surfaces tidy and clean by using an organized file system for work and home. Create customized color-coded systems with colored file folders or keep it simple with manila files. Reinforced tabs won't rip or tear with frequent handling. Packs with assorted tab positions make it easier to locate specific files in a crowded drawer. Card stock is more resilient for long-term durability.
Sort It with Hanging Files
The gliding convenience of hanging files helps you group similar folders together and ultimately protect your paperwork. Place the plastic tab anywhere on the top and sort your records by client names, months, years and details. Coated hangers on the side allow for easy sliding. If you're eco-conscious, look for folders made with post-consumer recycled paper.
A Presentation to Remember
Pocket folders keep presentation materials together for current and prospective clients. Laser-cut tabs on internal pockets let you include one or two business cards, so contact info is always close at hand. Plastic folders are reusable and sturdy, so they're ideal for transporting sensitive documents, photographs or schoolwork. Students may opt for clear or colored plastic folders to store and organize assignments term after term, especially if they need to prevent bending and tearing inside of a backpack or locker. Three-hole presentation folders fit into a binder to keep class work and papers organized. Report covers with clear fronts frame eye-catching graphics for an immediate impression.
Accordion Files Keep Everything Handy 
When you need to bring files offsite, or you don't have enough space in a dorm or apartment for a full-size file cabinet, accordion files have expandable compartments to hold tax records, receipts, escrow documents and contracts. Expanding wallets have elastic cords to keep contents secure while you're traveling from meeting to meeting.
File Sorters
If you've got a stack of paperwork you regularly reference for big accounts or ongoing projects, keep those files easily accessible on your desk with a file sorter. Mesh sorters look modern and fashionable in any office or home and have several compartments for folders and paperwork. Step file sorters have an angled rack to make tabs easier to read. Desk trays have discreet compartments for folders, fliers, portfolios and brochures.

"Submitting presentations to the boss, storing an entire year's worth of accounting information or filing important documents is simple with binders, folders and accessories. Ensure that binders meet business demands with an assortment of office binder accessories, such as tabbed dividers, pockets, sheet protectors and more. Hanging folders and binders let users categorize and subcategorize documents in a filing cabinet, ensuring quick access to needed documents without taking up any valuable shelf space.

Wide Variety Available
 Binders, folders and accessories, including dividers and sheet protectors, keep all types of important business documents organized and safely stored. They come in a wide variety of shapes, colors and applications to meet any business' demands -- including a variety of ring configurations like zipper binders to keep loose contents secure and attractive  presentation binders. Make sure binders are used to their full potential with the help of additional accessories, such as dividers and inserts. Pocket  binder folders and report covers are ideal for submitting professional-looking presentations.

Binder Accessories
Organize and protect the material within binders, folders and reference materials with the right accessories. Sheet protectors come in a standard 8.5 x 11 inches or in specialty sizes, and they fit nicely into standard and presentation binders to keep pages free from stains, smudges and tears. Tabbed dividers let users categorize sheets within binders, folders and files, eliminating endless searches for particular pages inside office binders. 

Binder Pockets
Made of plastic or paper, pocket folder binders can hold materials such as brochures, CDs and business cards when used inside folders and binders. They are available in nearly any color and often come in multipacks to fulfill the needs of larger offices. Store receipts in a mini pocket folder for easy record keeping, or add your business card to a stack of  office binders with adhesive pockets designed to stick to the interior or exterior of the binder."

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Even in a world where everything is increasingly paperless, sometimes there's no substitute for physical records. Folders are an essential part of any business's office supplies list and help prevent clutter from building up on your desk; keeping all of your vital paperwork organized. Tax records, contracts and insurance certificates are easy to access when you file them properly in a filing system, and pocket folders store class materials like syllabi, exam study questions and homework.
Long-Term File Storage
Law firms, accountants and tax preparers need to store thousands of files for clients and regulatory purposes. File storage boxes have removable lids and heavy-duty cardboard construction so you can keep them indefinitely in a storage room or onsite archive. Plastic file totes are waterproof and keep out pests like mites, moths and silverfish so your most important records remain pristine. Plastic crates with wing lids and locking lids prevent mildew and mold from infiltrating paperwork in damp environments.
File Folders for Quick and Easy Access 
Keep all of your surfaces tidy and clean by using an organized file system for work and home. Create customized color-coded systems with colored file folders or keep it simple with manila files. Reinforced tabs won't rip or tear with frequent handling. Packs with assorted tab positions make it easier to locate specific files in a crowded drawer. Card stock is more resilient for long-term durability.
Sort It with Hanging Files
The gliding convenience of hanging files helps you group similar folders together and ultimately protect your paperwork. Place the plastic tab anywhere on the top and sort your records by client names, months, years and details. Coated hangers on the side allow for easy sliding. If you're eco-conscious, look for folders made with post-consumer recycled paper.
A Presentation to Remember
Pocket folders keep presentation materials together for current and prospective clients. Laser-cut tabs on internal pockets let you include one or two business cards, so contact info is always close at hand. Plastic folders are reusable and sturdy, so they're ideal for transporting sensitive documents, photographs or schoolwork. Students may opt for clear or colored plastic folders to store and organize assignments term after term, especially if they need to prevent bending and tearing inside of a backpack or locker. Three-hole presentation folders fit into a binder to keep class work and papers organized. Report covers with clear fronts frame eye-catching graphics for an immediate impression.
Accordion Files Keep Everything Handy 
When you need to bring files offsite, or you don't have enough space in a dorm or apartment for a full-size file cabinet, accordion files have expandable compartments to hold tax records, receipts, escrow documents and contracts. Expanding wallets have elastic cords to keep contents secure while you're traveling from meeting to meeting.
File Sorters
If you've got a stack of paperwork you regularly reference for big accounts or ongoing projects, keep those files easily accessible on your desk with a file sorter. Mesh sorters look modern and fashionable in any office or home and have several compartments for folders and paperwork. Step file sorters have an angled rack to make tabs easier to read. Desk trays have discreet compartments for folders, fliers, portfolios and brochures.

Regardless of the need, there's no better place than Staples to find the best writing instruments.

Quality Brands

"Submitting presentations to the boss, storing an entire year's worth of accounting information or filing important documents is simple with binders, folders and accessories. Ensure that binders meet business demands with an assortment of office binder accessories, such as tabbed dividers, pockets, sheet protectors and more. Hanging folders and binders let users categorize and subcategorize documents in a filing cabinet, ensuring quick access to needed documents without taking up any valuable shelf space.

Wide Variety Available
 Binders, folders and accessories, including dividers and sheet protectors, keep all types of important business documents organized and safely stored. They come in a wide variety of shapes, colors and applications to meet any business' demands -- including a variety of ring configurations like zipper binders to keep loose contents secure and attractive  presentation binders. Make sure binders are used to their full potential with the help of additional accessories, such as dividers and inserts. Pocket  binder folders and report covers are ideal for submitting professional-looking presentations.

Binder Accessories
Organize and protect the material within binders, folders and reference materials with the right accessories. Sheet protectors come in a standard 8.5 x 11 inches or in specialty sizes, and they fit nicely into standard and presentation binders to keep pages free from stains, smudges and tears. Tabbed dividers let users categorize sheets within binders, folders and files, eliminating endless searches for particular pages inside office binders. 

Binder Pockets
Made of plastic or paper, pocket folder binders can hold materials such as brochures, CDs and business cards when used inside folders and binders. They are available in nearly any color and often come in multipacks to fulfill the needs of larger offices. Store receipts in a mini pocket folder for easy record keeping, or add your business card to a stack of  office binders with adhesive pockets designed to stick to the interior or exterior of the binder."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
