Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

About this book




Commercial Chicken Meat and Egg Production is the 5th  edition of a highly successful book first authored by Dr. Mack O.  North in 1972, updated in 1978 and 1984. The 4th edition was  co-authored with Donald D. Bell in 1990. The book has achieved  international success as a reference for students and commercial  poultry and egg producers in every major poultry producing country in  the world.   The 5th edition is essential reading for students preparing to  enter the poultry industry, for owners and managers of existing  poultry companies and for scientists who need a major source of  scientifically based material on poultry management.   In earlier editions, the authors emphasized the chicken and its  management. The 5th edition, with the emphasis shifted to the  commercial business of managing poultry, contains over 75% new  material. The contributions of 14 new authors make this new edition  the most comprehensive such book available. Since extensive references  are made to the international aspects of poultry management, all data  are presented in both the Imperial and Metric form.   Over 300 tables and 250 photos and figures support 62 chapters of  text. New areas include processing of poultry and eggs with thorough  discussions of food safety and further processing. The business of  maintaining poultry is discussed in chapters on economics, model  production firms, the use of computers, and record keeping. Updated  topics include: breeders and hatchery operations; broiler and layer  flock management; replacement programs and management of replacements;  nutrition; and flock health. New chapters address flock behavior,  ventilation, waste management, egg quality and egg breakage.   Other new features include a list of more than 400 references and a  Master List of the tables, figures, manufacturers of equipment and  supplies, research institutions, books and periodicals, breeders, and  trade associations.   Commercial growers will find the tables of data of particular  interest; scientists will be able to utilize the extensive references  and to relate their areas of interest to the commercial industry's  applications; and students will find that the division of the book  into 11 distinct sections, with multiple chapters in each, will make  the text especially useful.

Obituary



            Donald Donner Springer, 74, of Springfield, died at 5:19 p.m. on Thursday, January 24, 2013 at Memorial Medical Center.

Donald was born February 15, 1938 in Springfield, the son of Phil M. and Dorothy Bayne Springer, Jr.  Don married Karen Link on April 15, 1981 in Brentwood, MO.   

Donald graduated from Ottawa Township High School in 1956 and attended Iowa State University in Ames, IA from 1957 – 1958.  While at Iowa State, he was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity and played for the Cyclone Varsity Football team.  He later earned his Bachelor of Science from Southern Illinois University.  He proudly served his country in the United States Marine Corp from 1957 – 1963.  He was employed by several financial institutes, including Associates Financial Corporation, First National Bank, B.C. Ziegler and Company, and R Rowland and Company.  His most recent employment was with Edward Jones and Company from 1979 until his retirement in 2012.   

Don was very involved with the community and served or was a member of many organizations.  He was a one-time President of the Springfield Jaycees, City Chairman of the American Cancer Crusade, the Mayor's Commission on Downtown Parking, Senator in the International Jaycees, on the President's Council with R. Rowland and Company, Big Hat President for the American Business Club, Consulting Editor for Illinois Opinion News Journal, a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, Who's Who in Business, and Who's Who in the World; served as Director for both Center for American Archeology and the Springfield Film Commission, and was on the President's Council at the University of Illinois.  He enjoyed taking his grandchildren to the Den Chili Parlor, where he was a regular. He inspired outdoor enthusiasm in his children and grandchildren and his favorite activities were fishing, swimming, and visiting historical sites with his grandchildren.  His personal favorites were hunting, boating, and traveling.  Don has traveled with Karen to 87 countries and 7 continents.

Of special historical note, Don, along with his two brothers, enjoyed representing the ancestral connection to the Donner Party, of which they are sixth generation descendants.  Don has given many public presentations and has represented the family in the Springfield area for a number of years.

He was preceded in death by his parents.

He is survived by his wife, Karen S. Springer of Springfield; son, Douglas Donner Springer of Springfield; daughter, Paula K. (Douglas Lichter) Springer of Portland, OR; two step-sons, Jeff Davidson of Chatham and J.J.
