     These are speculative securities. Before you decide whether to invest in Series J, read this entire Prospectus carefully and consider “
The Risks You Face” section beginning on page 15. In particular you should be aware that:   






 •       Futures, forward and options trading is volatile and highly
leveraged and, as a result, even a small movement in market prices could cause large losses.   •       Series J will rely on its Advisors for success.   •       You could
lose all or substantially all of your investment.   •       No secondary market exists for the Series J Units and such Units may be redeemed monthly and may result in redemption charges as described above.
  
 •       Many of the instruments to be traded by Series J are not
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Series J will not receive the protections that are provided by such regulation with respect to such instruments.   •       Investors
will pay substantial fees in connection with their investment in Series J, including asset-based fees of up to 6.17% per annum for Class I Unitholders and up to 4.17% per annum for Class II Unitholders as well as incentive fees payable to each
Advisor equal to 20% of net profits generated by such Advisor on a cumulative high water mark basis.

SUMMARY  This summary of all material information provided in this Prospectus is intended for quick
reference only. The remainder of this Prospectus contains more detailed information; you should read the entire Prospectus, including the Statement of Additional Information and all exhibits to the Prospectus, before deciding to invest in Series J
Units. This Prospectus is intended to be used beginning April 30, 2008      
The Trust  World Monitor Trust III, or the Trust, was formed as a Delaware Statutory Trust on
September 28, 2004, with separate series, or each, a Series, of units of beneficial interest, or the Units. Its term will expire on December 31, 2054 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). The principal offices of the Trust
and Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., or the Managing Owner, are located at 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye Brook, New York 10573, and their telephone number is (914) 307-7000.  
The Series  The Trust’s Units will be offered in one (1) Series: Series J. The Trust may issue
additional Series of Units in the future. The Series J Units are separated into two classes, or each, a Class, of Units. Series J:   


 
•
 
 engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options contracts and other
derivative instruments and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions;   


 
•
 
 will segregate its assets from the assets of other Series (if any) and will maintain separate, distinct records from such other Series (if any), and account for its
assets separately from any other Series;   


 
•
 
 calculates its net assets and the Net Asset Value of its Units separately from any other Series;   


 
•
 
 has an investment objective of increasing the value of its Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; and
  


 
•
 
 offers Units in two Classes—Class I and Class II.  Series J has entered into managed account agreements with Advisors that manage the portion of the assets of Series J allocated to such Managed Account and make the trading decisions in respect of the assets of Series
J allocated to such Managed Accounts.  
Class I Units and Class II Units   


 
 •
 
 Series J pays a Service Fee in respect of the Class I Units, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Class I Units as of the beginning of the month. The Service Fee is paid directly
by Series J to the Selling Agent. The Selling Agent is responsible for paying all service fees owing to the Correspondent Selling Agents. The Correspondent Selling Agents are entitled to receive from the Selling Agent an initial service fee equal to
2.00% of the initial Net Asset Value per Unit of each Class I Unit sold by them, payable on the date such Class I Units are purchased and, commencing with the thirteenth month after the purchase of a Class I Unit, an ongoing monthly service fee
equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the beginning of the month of the Class I Units sold by them. In
addition to the above Service Fee, Series J pays to the Selling Agent a Sales Commission, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of 1.00% (1.00% per
annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Class I Units as of the beginning of the month.   


 
•
 
 Class II Units may only be offered to investors who are represented by approved Correspondent Selling Agents who are directly compensated by the investor for
services rendered in connection with an investment in Series J (such arrangements commonly referred to as “wrap-accounts”). Investors who purchase Class II Units of Series J are not charged any Service Fee.

Table of Contents
SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  
 However, Series J
pays to the Selling Agent a Sales Commission, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of 1.00% (1.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the
outstanding Class II Units as of the beginning of the month.  
Series J  Trading for Series J is directed by the following:   


 
•
 
 Graham Capital Management, L.P., or Graham, pursuant to its Global Diversified at 150% Leverage program, which is a technical, systematic, global macro program.
  


 
•
 
 Eagle Trading Systems Inc., or Eagle, pursuant to its Momentum Program, which is a technical, systematic global macro program.   


 
•
 
 Ortus Capital Management Limited and Ortus Capital Management (Cayman) Limited, collectively Ortus, pursuant to its Major Currency Program, which is a systematic
currency program.  (Through April 30, 2007, the portion of Series J’s assets allocated to Ortus were traded by
Bridgewater Associates, Inc., or Bridgewater, pursuant to its Aggressive Pure Alpha Futures Only – A, No Benchmark Program, which is a fundamental, systematic, global macro program. Performance and other information relating to Series J through
April 30, 2007 reflects the fact that Bridgewater, and not Ortus, directed a portion of Series J’s assets.)  The assets of Series
J are allocated equally among each of Graham, Eagle and Ortus, and Series J rebalances its exposure quarterly to maintain an equal exposure to each of them. One-third of the assets of Series J are traded by each of Graham, Eagle and Ortus pursuant
to the programs set forth above. We sometimes refer to Series J as the Balanced Series.  
Risk Factors  An investment in Series J Units of the Trust is speculative and involves a high degree of
risk.   


•
 
 The Trust and Series J have a limited operating history. Therefore, a potential investor has only a limited performance history to serve as a factor for evaluating
an investment in the Trust and Series J.   


•
 
 The Managing Owner may select and allocate Series J’s assets to new trading advisors or different programs of the Advisors at any time. It is expected that
Series J will at all times maintain an equal exposure (rebalanced quarterly) to each of the trading advisors who from time to time are responsible for managing the assets of Series J and making the trading decisions in respect of Series J’s
assets. However, the Managing Owner is under no obligation to cause Series J to maintain such proportional exposures or quarterly rebalancing. Unitholders of the Trust are fully dependent upon the Managing Owner’s ability to select such trading
advisors or programs.   


•
 
 Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results; all or substantially all of an investment in a Series could be lost. 
 


•
 
 The trading of Series J is highly leveraged and takes place in very volatile markets.   


•
 
 Series J is subject to the fees and expenses described herein and will be successful only if significant profits are achieved. To break even, and prior to any
applicable redemption charge, Series J must generate the below trading profits:   


 
•
 
 Series J, Class I: 6.90%   


 
•
 
 Series J, Class II: 4.50%   


 •
 
 There can be no assurance that Series J will achieve profits, significant or otherwise. Class I Units redeemed before
the first anniversary of their sale will be subject to a redemption charge equal to the product of (i) the Net Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by (ii) the number of months remaining
before the first anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by 1/12th of 2.00%.   


•
 
 Certain general types of market conditions — in particular, trendless periods without major price movements — significantly reduce the potential for
certain Advisors to trade successfully.   


•
 
 The incentive fee to be paid to the Advisors may encourage the Advisors to take riskier or more speculative positions than they might otherwise.
    
-2- 


Table of Contents
SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  



•
 
 Because Series J pays incentive fees to each of the Advisors who manage assets of Series J based upon the profitability of the trading of such Advisors
individually, and not based upon the profitability of Series J as a whole, Series J could pay incentive fees to Advisors in respect of periods during which Series J, as a whole, was not profitable.   


•
 
 Certain conflicts of interest exist between the Managing Owner, the Advisors, the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and Executing Brokers, the Selling Agent, the
Correspondent Selling Agents, and others and the Unitholders. These conflicts include allocation of the Managing Owner’s resources, other business activities of the Advisors, selection of executing brokers, execution of trades, the incentive
fees, recommendations as to the purchase or sale of Units, proprietary trading and other clients of the Managing Owner and the Advisors and other conflicts. The Managing Owner has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of
interest. Consequently, investors will be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Managing Owner attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, for the Managing Owner to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to a Series of the Trust.  
The Trustee  Wilmington Trust Company, or the Trustee, a Delaware banking corporation, is the Trust’s sole
trustee. The Trustee delegated to the Managing Owner all of the power and authority to manage the business and affairs of the Trust and has only nominal duties and liabilities to the Trust.  
The Trust and Its Objectives  Series J is a separate investment portfolio. Series J will trade under the
management of each of three Advisors and will allocate its assets to such Advisors in equal proportions, rebalanced quarterly.  The
Managing Owner has substantial experience in selecting and monitoring trading advisors, asset allocation and overall portfolio design using quantitative and qualitative methods. The Advisors trade entirely independently of each other, implementing
proprietary strategies in the markets of their choice. Series J has access to global futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options trading with the ability rapidly to deploy and redeploy its capital across different sectors
of the global economy.  In addition to selecting Advisors, the Managing Owner monitors the trading activity and performance of each Advisor
and adjusts the overall leverage at which Series J trades. The commitment of Series J to its Advisor(s) may exceed 100% of such Series’ total equity if the Managing Owner decides to strategically allocate notional equity to such Advisor(s).
This may result in increased profits or larger losses than would otherwise result. There likely will be periods in the markets during which it is unlikely that any Advisor will be profitable. By having the ability to leverage Series J’s market
commitment to below its actual equity during such periods, the Managing Owner could help preserve capital while awaiting more favorable market cycles.  Under the Trust’s Declaration of Trust, Wilmington Trust Company, the Trustee, has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of each Series of the Trust.
The Trustee has no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor does the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner.  In addition to monitoring the trading and performance of the Advisors, the Managing Owner also performs ongoing due diligence with respect to the
Advisors. If the Managing Owner determines that an Advisor has departed from its program or stated trading methodology or has exceeded its stated risk parameters, the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Trust, will take such actions as it deems
appropriate which may include terminating such Advisor. Similarly, if the Managing Owner’s ongoing due diligence leads the Managing Owner to determine that it is in the best interests of the Trust to terminate an Advisor, it will do so. If the
Managing Owner concludes, based upon its perception of market or economic conditions, that it is appropriate to allocate assets of Series J to a different trading program run by an Advisor, it will do so. The Managing Owner may select a replacement
Advisor if any Advisor resigns or is terminated.  There can be no assurance that Series J will achieve its rate of return or
diversification objective or avoid substantial losses. These pools have a limited performance history.

SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  
 
Preferred Investment Solutions Corp.  Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., a Delaware corporation, serves as
Managing Owner of the Trust and each Series. The Managing Owner originally was formed in 1983 as a New York corporation and was formerly known as Kenmar Advisory Corp. Its predecessor and affiliates have been sponsoring and managing single- and
multi-advisor funds for over two decades. As of February 29, 2008, the Managing Owner and its affiliates were acting as trading manager for commodity pools, funds of hedge funds and accounts with total capital (excluding “notional”
funds) of approximately $4.2 billion of discretionary and non-discretionary assets, of which approximately $168.5 million was invested in commodity pools operated by the Managing Owner. Effective October 1, 2004, the Managing Owner assumed
responsibility as the commodity pool operator and managing owner of nine (9) public commodity pools and four open-ended investment companies, which were exempted commodity pools in Ireland. Effective as of February 29, 2008, the Managing
Owner serves as the commodity pool operator and managing owner of seven (7) public commodity pools (including Series J) and one open-ended investment company, which is an exempted commodity pool in Ireland.  The principal office of the Trust is c/o Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye Brook, New York 10573. The telephone
number of the Trust and the Managing Owner is (914) 307-7000.  See “Performance of Commodity Pools Operated by the Managing Owner and its
Affiliates” for the performance of other commodity pools managed by the Managing Owner and its affiliates.  
The Advisors  The Advisors are all well-established in the managed futures and/or foreign exchange (FX)
industry and have, in the past, demonstrated the ability to make substantial profits in a wide range of different market conditions. These Advisors, collectively, represent a range of technical, systematic, fundamental and discretionary
methodologies, with extensive experience trading both proprietary and client capital. The Advisors were selected based upon the Managing Owner’s evaluation of each Advisor’s trading strategies, risk management, portfolio composition and
past performance, as well as how each Advisor’s strategies, portfolio and performance complement and differ from those of the other Advisors. The Managing Owner is authorized to utilize the services of additional trading advisors for a Series
or to employ additional trading programs of the Advisors, although the Managing Owner has no current intention to do so. The Managing Owner is authorized to allocate the assets of Series J unequally among the Advisors or to other trading advisors or
other programs of the Advisors, although the Managing Owner has no current intention to do so. The Managing Owner invests 100% of the proceeds from the offering of Series J Units equally among the Managed Accounts, and the Advisor corresponding to
each Managed Account apply all such proceeds for trading purposes. It is currently contemplated that 100% of additional capital raised on behalf of Series J will continue to be invested equally in the Managed Accounts. The Advisors are not
affiliated with the Trust, the Trustee or the Managing Owner. If an Advisor’s trading reaches a level where certain position limits restrict its trading, that Advisor will modify its trading instructions for the Trust and its other accounts in
a good faith effort to achieve an equitable treatment of all accounts. As of the date of this Prospectus, neither the Advisors nor any of their principals currently have any beneficial interest in the Trust, but some or all of such persons may
acquire such an interest in the future.  
The Clearing Broker  UBS Securities LLC, or UBS Securities, serves as clearing broker to the Trust on behalf
of Series J. In its capacity as clearing broker, UBS Securities executes and clears Series J’s futures, forward and options transactions and performs certain administrative services for the Trust on behalf of Series J.  
The Selling Agent; The Correspondent Selling Agents  Kenmar Securities Inc., or the Selling Agent, a Delaware
corporation and an affiliate of the Managing Owner, acts as a selling agent for the Trust. The Managing Owner and the Selling Agent intend to appoint certain other broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or the NASD, as additional selling agents, or Correspondent Selling Agents. The Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents use their “best efforts” to sell Units.
This means that the Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents are not required to purchase any Units or sell any specific number or

dollar amount of Units but will use their best efforts to sell the Units offered.  
The Administrator  Spectrum Global Fund Administration, L.L.C., or Spectrum, a Delaware limited liability
company located at 33 West Monroe – Suite 1000, Chicago, IL, USA, 60603, is the administrator of the Trust and provides certain administration and accounting services pursuant to the terms of a Services Agreement with the Trust effective
November 1, 2007.  Headquartered in Chicago, IL, Spectrum was founded in 1998, and currently services approximately 230 clients and
US$27 billion in alternative investment assets across all strategies. Spectrum employs over 200 professionals, with offices in Columbus, Ohio; New York; and Cayman Islands. While smaller and less well known than other fund administrators, Spectrum
utilizes superior internally-developed accounting systems, strong operational processes and controls, and the depth of managerial experience and knowledge.  Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Spectrum performs or supervises the performance of services necessary for the operation and administration of the Trust (other than making investment decisions), including
administrative and accounting services. Spectrum also calculates Net Asset Value and the Net Asset Value per Unit.  The Services Agreement
shall continue in force from launch for a period of eighteen months unless terminated on ninety (90) days’ prior written notice by either party to the other party. If not terminated, the Services Agreement will renew itself for successive
one-year terms subject to re-negotiation of the terms of compensation and services.  The Services Agreement provides for indemnification of
Spectrum and its directors, officers and employees from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (other than those
resulting from fraud, negligence or willful misconduct on its part or on the part of its directors, officers, servants or agents) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Spectrum in performing its obligations or duties under the
Services Agreement.  The fees payable to Spectrum are referred to in Fees and Expenses below.  
Liabilities You Assume  Although the Managing Owner has unlimited liability for any obligations of Series J
that exceed Series J’s Net Assets, your investment in Series J is part of the assets of that Series, and it will therefore be subject to the risks of Series J’s trading. You cannot lose more than your investment in Series J, and you will
not be subject to the losses or liabilities of Series J in which you have not invested. We have received an opinion of counsel that each Series will be entitled to the benefits of the limitation on inter-series liability under the Delaware Statutory
Trust Act. Each Unit, when purchased in accordance with the Trust Declaration, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be fully-paid and non-assessable.  
Limitation of Liabilities  The debts, liabilities, obligations, claims and expenses of Series J will be
enforceable against the assets of that Series only, and not against the assets of the Trust generally or the assets of any other Series (if any), and, unless otherwise provided in the Trust Declaration, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations
and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to the Trust generally or any other Series thereof will be enforceable against the assets of Series J.  
Who May Subscribe  An investment in the Trust is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. The Trust is
not suitable for all investors. The Managing Owner offers the Trust as an opportunity to diversify an investor’s entire investment portfolio. The Trust also offers the potential for profit subject to commensurate risk and volatility. An
investment in the Trust should only represent a limited portion of your overall portfolio. There can be no assurance that Series J will achieve its objective. To subscribe for Series J Units:

 You must have at a minimum (1) a net worth (exclusive of your home, home furnishings and automobiles) of at least $250,000 or (2) a net worth, similarly

does not mean that an investment in the Units is suitable for you;   


 
•
 
 You may not invest more than 10% of your net worth, exclusive of your home, furnishings and automobiles, in Series J;   


 
•
 
 Individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, Keogh and other employee benefit plans are subject to special suitability requirements and should not invest more than 10%
of their assets in Series J.  
What You Must Understand Before You Subscribe  You should not subscribe for Series J Units unless you
understand:   


 
•
 
 the fundamental risks and possible financial losses of the investment;   


 
•
 
 the trading strategies to be followed in Series J;   


 
•
 
 the tax consequences of this investment;   


 
•
 
 the tax consequences of any decision to sell securities to subscribe for Units;   


 
•
 
 the fees and expenses to which you will be subject; and   


 
•
 
 your rights and obligations as a Unitholder.  
How to Subscribe  To subscribe for Series J Units: You will be required to complete and submit to the Trust a
Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney in the form of Exhibit C hereto. The Managing Owner in its sole discretion may, for good cause, waive notice deadlines for subscriptions.  Any subscription may be rejected in whole or in part by the Managing Owner for any reason or for no reason.  
Your Minimum Subscription and Unit Pricing  Minimum required subscriptions and Unit prices are as follows:
  


 
•
 
 Your minimum initial subscription is $5,000, or, if you are a Benefit Plan Investor (including an IRA), your minimum initial subscription is $2,000;
  


 
•
 
 Each Series’ Units are offered and sold at their month-end Net Asset Value, and existing Unitholders are able to purchase additional Units. The minimum price
for an additional purchase is $2,000; and   


 
•
 
 If you are a resident of Texas and you are a Benefit Plan Investor, your minimum initial subscription is $5,000.  Organizational and initial offering expenses have been paid by the Managing Owner, subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in 36 monthly
payments during each of the first 36 months of the Trust’s operations; provided, however, that   


 
•
 
 in no event shall the Managing Owner be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses in an aggregate amount in excess of 2.5% of the aggregate amount of
all subscriptions accepted by the Trust during the initial offering period and the first 36 months of the Trust’s operations; and   


 
•
 
 in no event shall the amount of any payment in any month for reimbursement of such expenses, together with any similar payment in such month for
reimbursement of offering expenses subsequently incurred, in the aggregate, exceed 0.50% per annum of the Net Asset Value of a Series as of the beginning of such month.  If Series J terminates prior to completion of the foregoing reimbursement, or the full amount of such expenses has not been fully reimbursed by the end
of such 36 month period, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to receive any further reimbursement in respect of such expenses and Series will have no

further obligation to make reimbursement payments in respect of such expenses.  
The Offering  Series J Units are offered as of the beginning of each month and will continue to be offered
until the maximum amount of Series J Units that are registered are sold. The Managing Owner may suspend or terminate the offering of Series J Units at any time or extend the offering by registering additional Units.  
Subscription Effective Dates; Transfer of Units  The effective date of all accepted subscriptions, whether you
are a new subscriber to Series J or an existing Unitholder in Series J who is purchasing additional Units in that Series, is the first business day of the next month commencing five (5) Business Days after the day in which your Subscription
Agreement is received by the Managing Owner on a timely basis by 10:00 AM New York City Time, or NYT. For example, for a subscription to be effective on Friday, August 1, 2008, your Subscription Agreement would have to be received by the
Managing Owner on Friday, July 25, 2008 by 10:00 AM NYT. The Managing Owner may, in its sole discretion and for good cause, change such notice requirement upon written notice to you.  The Trust Declaration restricts the transferability and assignability of Series J Units. There is not now, nor is there expected to be, a primary or
secondary trading market for Series J Units.  
Redemptions  To redeem Units, Unitholders may contact their Correspondent Selling Agent (in writing if
required by such Correspondent Selling Agent). Correspondent Selling Agents must notify the Managing Owner in writing in order to effectuate redemptions of the Units. A signature guarantee may be required by your Correspondent Selling Agent or the
Managing Owner. However, a Unitholder who no longer has a Correspondent Selling Agent account must request redemption in writing (signature guaranteed unless waived by the Managing Owner) by corresponding with the Managing Owner.  A Unitholder may redeem any or all of his or her Units as of the close of business on the last Business Day of any calendar month — beginning with
the end of the first month following such Unitholder’s purchase of such Units — at Net Asset Value, provided that the Request for Redemption is received by the Managing Owner by 10:00 AM New York time at 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye
Brook, New York 10573, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the end of such month excluding the last Business Day of the month. A redemption will be effective as of the close of business on the last Business Day of any calendar month. For
example, if the last Business Day of the month is a Friday, notice must be received by the Managing Owner by 10:00 AM New York time on Friday of the immediately preceding week. The Managing Owner may, in its sole discretion and for good cause, waive
notice deadlines for redemptions. Your minimum redemption request may be the lesser of either $1,000 or ten (10) Units; provided that, if you are redeeming less than all your Units, your remaining Units in Series J must have an aggregate Net
Asset Value of at least $5,000. If you only redeem some of your Units and as a result, your account balances fall below the minimum investment amount (i.e., $5,000) you may be compulsorily redeemed at the Managing Owner’s sole
discretion.  
Segregated Accounts/Interest Income  Except for that portion of Series J’s assets used as margin to
maintain that Series’ forward currency contract positions, the proceeds of the offering for Series J are deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of the Trust on behalf of Series J at the Clearing Broker or another eligible
financial institution in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. The Trust on behalf of Series J is credited with 100% of the interest earned on its average net assets on deposit with the Clearing Broker or such other financial institution
each month. In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest non-margin assets in U.S. government securities (which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States), or
any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the United States government, and certain cash items such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (under nine
months) and time deposits or other instruments permitted by applicable rules and regulations. Currently, the rate of interest expected to be earned is estimated to be 1.15% per annum, although such interest income is variable based on
short-term interest rates.

Fees and Expenses   






Management Fee
  
Series J pays to the Managing Owner in arrears a monthly management fee equal to 1/12th of
0.50% (0.50% per annum) of the Net Asset Value of Series J as of the beginning of the month.




Advisors’ Fees
  
Series J pays to Graham in arrears a monthly base fee equal to 1/12th of 2.50% (2.50% per
annum) on portion of the assets of Series J under the management of Graham as of the end of the month. Series J pays to each of Eagle and Ortus in arrears a monthly base fee equal to 1/12th
 of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) on the portion of the assets of Series J under the management of such Advisors as of the end of the month. Each Series pays an incentive fee of 20% of “New High Net
Trading Profits” generated by such Advisor, including realized and unrealized gains and losses thereon, as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar quarter. Series J pays such incentive fee separately with respect to each of
its Advisors based on “New High Net Trading Profits” generated by such Advisor, regardless of the profitability of Series J as a whole. The incentive fees are paid quarterly in arrears.




Sales Commission
  
Series J pays the Selling Agent a Sales Commission, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of
1.00% (1.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Series J Units as of the beginning of each month.




Brokerage Commissions and Fees
  
Series J pays to the Clearing Broker all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses
charged in connection with Series J’s trading activities. On average, total charges paid to the Clearing Broker are expected to be less than $10.00 per round-turn trade, although the Clearing Broker’s brokerage commissions and trading fees
will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The Managing Owner does not expect brokerage commissions and fees to exceed 1.50% of the Net Asset Value of Series J in any year.




Extraordinary Fees and Expenses
  
Series J pays all its extraordinary fees and expenses, if any, and its allocable portion of all extraordinary fees and expenses of the Trust generally, if any, as determined by the Managing
Owner. Such extraordinary fees and expenses, by their nature, are unpredictable in terms of timing and amount. Series J could conceivably be liable for such fees and expenses up to the entire amount of its net assets.




Routine Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses
  
Series J pays all of its routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses and its allocable share of all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the
Trust generally, as determined by the Managing Owner including, but not limited to, accounting and computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, filing fees, printing,
mailing and duplication costs. Such routine expenses are currently estimated to be 0.75% for Series J. The Managing Owner expects that as the Net Asset Value of Series J increases, the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses
of Series J will decline as a percentage of Series J’s Net Asset Value.

Organization and Offering Expenses
  
 Expenses incurred in connection with the organization of the Trust and the initial offering of Units were $1,454,441, of which $1,384,181 was
allocated to Series J. Such organizational and initial offering expenses were paid by the Managing Owner, subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in 36 monthly payments during each of the first 36 months of the Trust’s
operations; provided, however, that in no event shall the Managing Owner be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses in an aggregate amount in excess of 2.5% of the aggregate amount of all subscriptions accepted by the Trust during
the initial offering period and the first 36 months of the Trust’s operations. If Series J terminates prior to completion of the foregoing reimbursement, or the full amount of such expenses has not been fully reimbursed by the end of such
36-month period, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to receive any further reimbursement in respect of such expenses from such Series. As of February 29, 2008, Series J has reimbursed the Managing Owner $735,896 for organization and
initial offering expenses.   The Managing Owner also is responsible for the payment of
all offering expenses of Series J incurred after the Initial Offering Period; provided, however, that the amount of such offering expenses paid by the Managing Owner shall be subject to reimbursement by Series J, without interest, in
up to 36 monthly payments during each of the first 36 months following the month in which such expenses were paid by the Managing Owner. If Series J terminates prior to the completion of any such reimbursement, or the full amount of such expenses
has not been fully reimbursed by the end of such 36-month period, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to receive any unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of the date of such termination. Through February 29, 2008, expenses
incurred in connection with ongoing offering of Series J Units are $1,142,522, of which $1,085,360 has been allocated to Series J. Ongoing offering costs incurred through November 30, 2006 in the amount of $599,062 will not be reimbursed to the
Managing Owner. Through February 29, 2008, no reimbursement has been paid to the Managing Owner for ongoing offering cost incurred for the period December 1, 2006 through February 29, 2008 in the amount of $486,298.   In no event will the aggregate amount of payments by Series J in any month in respect of
reimbursement of organizational and offering expenses exceed 0.50% per annum of the Net Asset Value of Series J as of the beginning of such month.




Service Fees
  
 Class I   The Trust pays to the Selling Agent a Service Fee in respect of the Class I Units of Series J, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Class I Units at the beginning of the month, for services provided to the Trust and its Unitholders. The Service Fee is compensation which
remains payable with respect to the Class I Units for as long as such Units are outstanding.   Class II   Investors who purchase Class II Units are not charged any
Service Fee in respect of such Class II Units. Class II Units may only be offered to investors who are represented by approved Correspondent Selling Agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services rendered in connection with an
investment in the Trust (such arrangements commonly referred to as “wrap-accounts”).

SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  







Redemption Charge
  
 There is no redemption charge in respect of Class II Units.   A Class I Unitholder who redeems a Class I Unit prior to the first anniversary of the purchase of such Unit will be subject to a redemption charge in an amount equal to
the product of (i) the Net Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by (ii) the number of months remaining before the first anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by (iii)
1/12th of 2.00%. Redemption charges do not reduce Net Asset Value or New High Net Trading Profit for any purpose, only the amount that Unitholders
receive upon redemption.   In the event that an investor acquires Series J Units at more
than one closing date, the redemption charge will be calculated on a “first-in, first-out” basis for redemption purposes (including determining the amount of any applicable redemption charge).

SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  
 
Break-Even Amounts  The following summary displays the estimated amount of all fees and expenses that are
anticipated to be incurred by a new investor in each Class of Series J during the first twelve months. In each case, the total estimated cost and expense load is expressed as a percentage of $5,000, the amount of minimum investment in the Trust
(other than IRAs or Benefit Plan Investors).  Series J, Class I: 6.90% (or $344.77 for each $5,000 invested); and  Series J, Class II: 4.50% (or $224.77 for each $5,000 invested).  
Distributions  The Managing Owner will make distributions to you at its discretion. Because the Managing Owner
does not presently intend to make ongoing distributions, your income tax liability for the profits of Series J Units in which you have invested will, in all likelihood, exceed any distributions you receive from Series J.  
Fiscal Year  The Trust’s fiscal year ends on December 31 on each year.  
Financial Information  Audited financial statements for Series J as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2007 is included in the Statement of Additional Information included with this Prospectus beginning on page F-1.  
Glossary of Defined Terms  See the “Glossary of Defined Terms” on page GL-1 for page references to
certain key terms used in this Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information.  
Tax Status of Series J  In the opinion of counsel, Series J of the Trust will be classified as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes and, based on the type of income expected to be earned by Series J, will not be treated as a “publicly traded partnership” taxable as a corporation. Unitholders of Series J will pay tax each year on their
allocable share of Series J’s taxable income, if any, whether or not they receive any distributions from Series J or redeem any Units. Substantially all of the trading gains and losses of Series J will be treated as capital gains or losses for
tax purposes; interest income received by Series J will be treated as ordinary income.  
“Breakeven Table”  The “Breakeven Table” on the following page indicates the approximate
percentage and dollar returns required for the redemption value of an initial $5,000 investment in the Series J Units to equal the amount originally invested twelve (12) months after issuance.  The “Breakeven Table,” as presented, is an approximation only. The capitalization of Series J of the Trust does not directly affect the
level of its charges as a percentage of Net Asset Value, other than (i) Administrative Expenses, (ii) Organizational and Offering Expenses (which are assumed for purposes of the “Breakeven Table” to equal the maximum permissible
percentage of Series J’s average beginning of month Net Asset Value), and (iii) Brokerage Commissions.  [Remainder of page

1.
The foregoing breakeven analysis assumes that the Units have a constant month-end Net Asset Value. Calculations are based on $5,000 as the Net Asset Value per Unit. See
“Charges” beginning on page 78 for an explanation of the expenses included in the “Breakeven Table.” 


2.
Class II Units may be offered and sold only to investors who are represented by approved Correspondent Selling Agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services
rendered in connection with an investment in the Trust (such arrangements commonly referred to as “wrap-accounts”). Class II Unitholders are not charged any Service Fee. 


3.
Based on assumptions herein, the Advisor’s Incentive Fee is 0.90% for Class I and 0.50% for Class II. 


 4.
 Investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class I Units of Series J before the first anniversary of the purchase of
such Units will be subject to a redemption charge (which amount is reflected in this Service Fee item) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Net Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by
(ii) the number of months remaining before the first anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by (iii) 1/12th of
2.00%. 


 5.
 Each Unit purchased pays to Kenmar Securities Inc. in arrears a monthly Sales Commission equal to 1/12th of 1.00% (1.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value of the outstanding Units as of the beginning of the month. 


6.
Administrative expenses are currently estimated to be 0.75%. Actual expenses may be higher or lower. The Managing Owner expects that as the Net Asset Value of Series J increases,
the administrative expenses of Series J will decline as a percentage of Series J’s Net Asset Value. 


7.
Expense levels are assumed to be at maximum amount. Actual expenses may be lower. 


8.
Although the actual rates of brokerage commissions and transaction related fees and expenses are the same for all Advisors, the total amount of brokerage commissions and trading
fees varies from Advisor to Advisor based upon the trading frequency of the Advisors and the specific futures contracts traded. The estimates presented in the table above are prepared using historical data about the Advisors’ trading
activities. 


9.
Interest income is currently estimated to be earned at a rate of 1.15%, although such interest income is variable based on short-term interest rates. 


10.
For purposes of this breakeven analysis, we have assumed (i) that the Advisors will have identical performance and identical incentive fees, (ii) that the Advisors will
generate a weighted average rate of brokerage commissions and other expenses equal to 0.23%, and (iii) a weighted average Advisor’s base fee of 2.17%. In actuality, the Advisors’ performance and incentive fees will be divergent among
the Advisors, the Advisors will generate a weighted average rate of brokerage commissions and other expenses which could be higher or lower than 0.23% and, because Advisors’ base fees are assessed monthly while Series J will rebalance
quarterly, weighted average Advisors’ base fees could be higher or lower than 2.17%.

SUMMARY (cont’d) 
  
 
Reports to Unitholders  As of the end of each month and as of the end of each Fiscal Year, the Managing Owner
will furnish you with those reports required by the CFTC and the National Futures Association, or the NFA, including, but not limited to, an annual audited financial statement certified by independent public accountants and any other reports
required by any other governmental authority, such as the SEC, that has jurisdiction over the activities of the Trust. You also will be provided with appropriate information to permit you to file your Federal and state income tax returns with
respect to your Units.  
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This Prospectus includes forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that reflect the Managing Owner’s current expectations about the future results, performance, prospects and opportunities of the Trust. The Managing Owner has tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using
words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “should,” “estimate” or the negative of those terms or similar expressions. These
forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Managing Owner and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, both known, such as those described in “The Risks You Face” and elsewhere
in this Prospectus, and unknown, that could cause the Trust’s actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, the Managing Owner
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Prospectus, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other
reason after the date of this Prospectus.  THE UNITS ARE SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVE A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

Table of Contents


THE RISKS YOU FACE  This section includes the principal risk that you will face with an investment in
Series J.   


 

(1)
You Should Not Rely on Past Performance in Deciding Whether to Buy Units  Each Advisor selected by the Managing Owner to manage the assets of Series J has a performance history through the date of its selection. You must consider, however, the uncertain significance of past performance, and
you should not rely on the Advisors’ or the Managing Owner’s records to date for predictive purposes. You should not assume that any Advisor’s future trading decisions will create profit, avoid substantial losses or result in
performance for Series J that is comparable to that Advisor’s or to the Managing Owner’s past performance. In fact, as a significant amount of academic study has shown, futures funds more frequently than not under-perform the past
performance records included in their prospectuses.  Because you and other investors will acquire, exchange and redeem Units at different
times, you may experience a loss on your Units even though Series J as a whole is profitable and even though other investors in Series J experience a profit. The past performance of Series J may not be representative of your investment experience in
it.  The assets of Series J are:   


 
•
 
 segregated from the assets of other Series (if any); and   


 
•
 
 valued and accounted for separately from any other Series.  Consequently, the past performance of Series J has no bearing on the past performance of any other Series.  The Trust has a limited operating history upon which to evaluate your investment in Series J. Although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, if the Trust had a material amount of performance history, such
performance history might provide you with more information on which to evaluate an investment in the Trust. Because the Trust has no material performance history, you will have to make your decision to invest in Series J without such information.
  


 

(2)
Price Volatility May Possibly Cause the Total Loss of Your Investment  Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment in a Series
of the Trust.   


 

(3)
Speculative and Volatile Markets Combined With Highly Leveraged Trading May Cause the Trust to Incur Substantial Losses  The markets in which Series J trades are speculative, highly leveraged and involve a high degree of risk. Each Advisor’s trading considered
individually involves a significant risk of incurring large losses, and there can be no assurance that Series J will not incur such losses.  Futures and forward prices are volatile. Volatility increases risk, particularly when trading with leverage. Trading on a highly leveraged basis, as does Series J, even in stable markets involves risk; doing so in volatile markets
necessarily involves a substantial risk of sudden, significant losses. Due to such leverage, even a small movement in price could cause large losses for the Trust. Market volatility will increase the potential for large losses. Market volatility
and leverage mean that Series J could incur substantial losses, potentially impairing its equity base and ability to achieve its long-term profit objectives even if favorable market conditions subsequently develop.  In addition to the leveraged trading described above, the Managing Owner has the ability to further increase the leverage of Series J by allocating
notional equity to one or more of its Advisors (in a maximum amount of up to 20% of Series J’s Net Asset Value), which would then permit such Advisor(s) to trade the account of Series J as if more equity were committed to such accounts than is,
in fact, the case. Although the Managing Owner has the option to allocate additional notional equity to an Advisor, the Managing Owner has no current plans to do so.   


 

(4)
Fees and Commissions are Charged Regardless of Profitability and May Result in Depletion of Trust Assets  Series J is subject to the fees and expenses described herein which are payable irrespective of profitability in addition to performance fees which

  
-15- 


Table of Contents

are payable to each Advisor based on such Advisor’s profitability and not on the profitability of Series J as a whole. Such fees and expenses include
asset-based fees of up to 6.17% per annum for Class I Unitholders and up to 4.17% per annum for Class II Unitholders as well as incentive fees equal to 20% of net profits on a cumulative high water mark basis. Included in these charges are
brokerage fees and operating expenses. On Series J’s forward trading, “bid-ask” spreads are incorporated into the pricing of Series J’s forward contracts by its counterparties in addition to the brokerage fees paid by Series J.
It is not possible to quantify the “bid-ask” spreads paid by Series J because Series J cannot determine the profit its counterparty is making on the forward trades into which it enters. Consequently, the expenses of Series J could, over
time, result in significant losses to your investment therein. You may never achieve profits, significant or otherwise.   


 

(5)
Market Conditions May Impair Profitability  The trading systems used by certain Advisors are technical, trend-following methods. The profitability of trading under these systems depends on, among other things, the occurrence of significant price trends which are sustained
movements, up or down, in futures and forward prices. Such trends may not develop; there have been periods in the past without price trends. The likelihood of the Units being profitable could be materially diminished during periods when events
external to the markets themselves have an important impact on prices. During such periods, Advisors’ historic price analysis could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such events.  Graham and Eagle employ technical programs.   


 

(6)
Discretionary Trading Strategies May Incur Substantial Losses  Discretionary traders, while they may utilize market charts, computer programs and compilations of quantifiable fundamental information to assist them in making trading decisions, make such decisions on the basis of
their own judgment and “trading instinct,” not on the basis of trading signals generated by any program or model. Such traders may be more prone to subjective judgments that may have greater potentially adverse effects on their performance
than systematic traders, which emphasize eliminating the effects of “emotionalism” on their trading. Reliance on trading judgment may, over time, produce less consistent trading results than implementing a systematic approach.
Discretionary traders, like trend-following traders, are unlikely to be profitable unless major price movements occur. Discretionary traders are highly unpredictable, and can incur substantial losses even in apparently favorable markets. 
As of the date of this Prospectus, none of the Advisors are employing discretionary strategies on behalf of Series J, although each Advisor reserves
the right to make discretionary decisions.   


 

(7)
Systematic Trading Strategies May Incur Substantial Losses  A systematic trader will generally rely to some degree on judgmental decisions concerning, for example, what markets to follow and commodities to trade, when to liquidate a position in a contract which is about to
expire and how large a position to take in a particular commodity. Although these judgmental decisions may have a substantial effect on a systematic trader’s performance, such trader’s primary reliance is on trading programs or models that
generate trading signals. The systems utilized to generate trading signals are changed from time to time (although generally infrequently), but the trading instructions generated by the systems being used are followed without significant additional
analysis or interpretation. Therefore, systematic trading may incur substantial losses by failing to capitalize on market trends that their systems would otherwise have exploited by applying their generally mechanical trading systems by judgmental
decisions of employees. Furthermore, any trading system or trader may suffer substantial losses by misjudging the market. Systematic traders tend to rely on computerized programs, and some consider the prospect of disciplined trading, which largely
removes the emotion of the individual trader from the trading process, advantageous. Due to their reliance upon computers, systematic traders are generally able to incorporate a significant amount of data into a particular trading decision. However,
when fundamental factors dominate the market, trading systems may suffer rapid and severe losses due to their inability to respond to such factors until such factors have had a sufficient effect on the market to create a trend of enough magnitude to
generate a reversal of trading signals, by which time a precipitous price change may already be in progress, preventing liquidation at anything but substantial losses.  The programs utilized by Graham Eagle and Ortus are systematic trading strategies.

Decisions Based Upon Fundamental Analysis May Not Result in Profitable Trading  Traders that utilize fundamental trading strategies attempt to examine factors external to the trading market that affect the supply and demand for a
particular futures and forward contracts in order to predict future prices. Such analysis may not result in profitable trading because the analyst may not have knowledge of all factors affecting supply and demand, prices may often be affected by
unrelated factors, and purely fundamental analysis may not enable the trader to determine quickly that previous trading decisions were incorrect. In addition, because of the breadth of fundamental data that exists, a fundamental trader may not be
able to follow developments in all such data, but instead may specialize in analyzing a narrow set of data, requiring trading in fewer markets. Consequently, a fundamental trader may have less flexibility in adverse markets to trade other futures
and forward markets than traders that do not limit the number of markets traded as a result of a specialized focus.  Ortus utilizes trading
strategies that incorporate fundamental data on behalf of its program.   


 

(9)
Increase in Assets Under Management May Affect Trading Decisions  Many of the Advisors’ current equity under management is at or near its all-time high. As of February 29, 2008 Graham, Eagle and Ortus each managed approximately $5.2 billion, $2.5 billion and $1.8 billion,
respectively. Graham and Ortus are near their all time high with respect to assets under management. The more equity an Advisor manages, the more difficult it may be for that Advisor to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger
positions without adversely affecting prices and performance. Accordingly, such increases in equity under management may require one or more of the Advisors to modify trading decisions for Series J that could have a detrimental effect on your
investment.   


 

(10)
You Cannot be Assured of the Advisors’ Continued Services Which May Be Detrimental to the Trust  You cannot be assured that any Advisor will be willing or able to continue to provide advisory services to Series J for any length of time. There is
severe competition for the services of qualified trading advisors, and Series J may not be able to retain satisfactory replacement or additional trading advisors on acceptable terms or a current Advisor may require Series J to pay higher fees in
order to be able to retain such Advisor. The Managing Owner may either terminate an Advisor upon 30 days’ prior written notice, or upon shorter notice, if for cause. Each Advisor has the right to terminate the Advisory Agreement in its
discretion at any time for cause.   


 

(11)
Limited Ability to Liquidate Your Investment  There is no secondary market for the Units. While the Units have redemption, there are
restrictions, and possible fees assessed. For example, Units may be redeemed only as of the close of business on the last Business Day of a calendar month provided a Request for Redemption is received at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the end of such month excluding the last Business Day of the month. In addition, Units of Class I may be subject to redemption charges if redeemed prior to the first anniversary of their issuance in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Net
Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by (ii) the number of months remaining before the first anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by (iii) 1/12th of 2.00%.  Transfers of Units are subject to
limitations, such as thirty (30) days’ advance notice of any intent to transfer. Also, the Managing Owner may deny a request to transfer if it determines that the transfer may result in adverse legal or tax consequences for the Trust or
Series J.   


 

(12)
Possible Illiquid Markets May Exacerbate Losses  Futures and forward positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price. It is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. A market disruption, such as
when foreign governments may take or be subject to political actions which disrupt the markets in their currency or major exports, can also make it difficult to liquidate a position. Periods of illiquidity have accrued from time-to-time in the past,
such as in connection with Russia’s default on its sovereign debt in 1998. Such periods of illiquidity and the events that trigger them are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that any Advisor will be able to do so. 
There can be no assurance that market illiquidity will not cause losses for a Series of the 
  
-17- 


Table of Contents

Trust. The large size of the positions which an Advisor is expected to acquire for Series J increases the risk of illiquidity by both making its positions
more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so.  Generally, Eagle has not historically allocated more
than 10% of its assets under management pursuant to its Eagle Momentum Program to over-the-counter instruments. Graham allocates 100% of the assets allocated to it for foreign exchange trading to over-the-counter instruments. Ortus expects to
allocate 100% of the assets allocated to it to over-the-counter instruments. The risk of loss due to potentially illiquid markets is more acute in respect of over-the-counter instruments than in respect of exchange-traded instruments because the
performance of those contracts is not guaranteed by an exchange or clearinghouse and the Series will be at risk to the ability of the counterparty to the instrument to perform its obligations thereunder. Because these markets are not regulated,
there are no specific standards or regulatory supervision of trade pricing and other trading activities that occur in those markets.   


 

(13)
Because Series J Does Not Acquires Any Asset with Intrinsic Value, the Positive Performance of Your Investment Is Wholly Dependent Upon an Equal and Offsetting Loss
 Futures and forward trading is a risk transfer economic activity. For every gain there is an equal and offsetting loss rather
than an opportunity to participate over time in general economic growth. Unlike most alternative investments, an investment in Series J does not involve acquiring any asset with intrinsic value. Overall stock and bond prices could rise significantly
and the economy as a whole prospers while Series J trades unprofitably.   


 

(14)
Failure of Futures and Foreign Exchange Trading to be Non-Correlated to General Financial Markets Will Eliminate Benefits of Diversification 
Historically, managed futures and foreign exchange generally have been non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and
bonds. Non-correlation means that there is no statistically valid relationship between the past performance of futures and forward contracts on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative
correlation, where the performance would be exactly opposite between two asset classes. Because of this non-correlation, Series J can be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice-versa.
The futures and forward markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in futures and forward trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. If Series J does not perform in a manner non-correlated with the
general financial markets or does not perform successfully, you will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in the Units and Series J may have no gains to offset your losses from other investments.   


 

(15)
Broad Indices May Perform Quite Differently From Individual Investments  In the discussion under “Investment Factors,” the concepts of overall portfolio diversification and non-correlation of asset classes are discussed and illustrated by the use of a generally accepted index
that represents each asset category. Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index and MSCI EAFE Index; bonds are represented by the Lehman Long-Term Government Bond Index; futures funds are represented by the Barclay CTA Index, and currencies are
represented by the Barclay Currency Index. Because each index is a dollar-weighted average of the returns of multiple underlying investments, the overall index return and risk may be quite different from the return of any individual investment. For
example, the “Barclay CTA Index” is an unweighted index that attempts to measure the performance of the CTA industry. The Index measures the combined performance of all CTAs that have more than four years of past performance. For purposes
of calculating the Index, the first four years of a CTA’s performance history is ignored. Accordingly, such index reflects the volatility and risk of loss characteristics of a very broadly diversified universe of advisors and not of a single
fund or advisor. Therefore, the performance of Series J will be different than that of the Barclay CTA Index and the Barclay Currency Index.   


 

(16)
Advisors Trading Independently of Each Other May Reduce Profit Potential and Insurance Risks Through Offsetting Positions  The Advisors trade entirely independently of each other. Two Advisors may, from time to time, take opposite positions, eliminating any possibility that an
investor that holds Units in Series J may profit from these positions considered as a whole but incurring the usual expenses associated with taking 
  
-18- 


Table of Contents

such positions. The Advisors’ programs may, at times, be similar to one another thereby negating the benefits of investing in more than one Advisor by
purchasing Units of Series J, which may, in fact, increase risk. Two or more Advisors may compete with each other to acquire the same position, thereby increasing the costs incurred by each of them to take such position. It is also possible that two
or more Advisors, although trading independently, could experience drawdowns at the same time, thereby negating the potential benefit associated with exposure to more than one Advisor and more than one program. Series J’s multi-advisor
structure will not necessarily control the risk of speculative futures or forward trading. Multi-advisor funds may have significant volatility and risk despite being relatively diversified among trading advisors.   


 

(17)
Trading on Commodity Exchanges Outside the United States is Not Subject to U.S. Regulation  Each of the Advisors is expected to engage in some or all of its trading on commodity exchanges outside the United States. Trading on such
exchanges is not regulated by any United States governmental agency and may involve certain risks not applicable to trading on United States exchanges. In trading contracts denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Series J will be subject
to the risk of adverse exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the functional currencies of such contracts. Investors could incur substantial losses from trading on foreign exchanges by Series J to which such Investors would not have been
subject had the Advisors limited their trading to U.S. markets.  On an annual basis, each of the below programs traded approximately
the following percentage of assets on foreign exchanges:   







 Program
  
Range
 

 Graham Global Diversified at 150% Leverage
  
30-40
%*

 Eagle Momentum Program
  
30-40
%

 Ortus Major Currency Program
  
0
%
 The above ranges are only approximations with respect to each offered program. Actual percentages
may be either lesser or greater than above-listed. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  *Currently, in its
allocation of maximum exposures to different markets and sectors, the exposure of Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage allocated to trades on foreign exchanges is set by its system at approximately 30-40%, meaning that if identifiable
trends existed in all the markets Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage trades over an entire year, the approximate percentage range of assets of Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage allocated for trading on foreign
exchanges would be approximately 30-40%. The actual percentage of Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage assets traded on foreign exchanges over any period of time, however, depends greatly on trading conditions and can therefore vary
widely. For example, to the extent there are no trends on domestic exchanges, Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage would minimize its trading on them, thereby increasing the actual percentage of Graham’s Global Diversified at 150%
Leverage assets traded on foreign exchanges. It is therefore quite possible that though the theoretical allocation to foreign markets is set at approximately 30-40% of its assets, Graham’s Global Diversified at 150% Leverage’s actual
percentage trading on foreign exchanges for a given period may be much higher, in consequence of domestic markets offering fewer trading opportunities.   


 

(18)
Various Actual and Potential Conflicts of Interest May Be Detrimental to Unitholders  The Trust is subject to actual and potential conflicts of interests involving the Managing Owner, the Advisors, various brokers and selling agents. The
Managing Owner, the Advisors, and their respective principals, all of which are engaged in other investment activities, are not required to devote substantially all of their time to the Trust’s business, which also presents the potential for
numerous conflicts of interest with the Trust. As a result of these and other relationships, parties involved with the Trust have a financial incentive to act in a manner other than in the best interests of the Trust and its Unitholders. The
Managing Owner has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest. Consequently, investors will be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the
Managing Owner attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Managing Owner to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to Series J.   
-19- 


Table of Contents
The Trust may be subject to certain conflicts with respect to its Clearing Broker, its Futures Broker,
and any executing broker including, but not limited to, conflicts that result from receiving greater amounts of compensation from other clients, purchasing opposite or competing positions on behalf of third party accounts traded through the Clearing
Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers.  The Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents will be entitled to ongoing
compensation as a result of their clients remaining in Series J, so a conflict exists between their interest in maximizing compensation and in advising their clients to make investment decisions in such clients’ best interests.  The Managing Owner and the Selling Agent are both owned by Kenmar Holdings Inc., or KHI, which could give rise to conflicts of interest because their
compensation in each role is based on the Net Asset Value of Units outstanding. Like the employees of the Correspondent Selling Agents, the employees of the Selling Agent may have a conflict of interest between acting in the best interest of their
clients and assuring continued compensation to their employer.  KHI has entered into a loan agreement with UBS Loan Finance, LLC, an
affiliate of UBS Securities, among other things, to facilitate the Selling Agent’s payment of the initial service fee with respect to the Class I Units. UBS Loan Finance may make or deny a loan to KHI in its sole discretion. In the event of a
default by KHI, UBS Loan Finance may call any or all outstanding loans. Moreover, UBS Loan Finance may terminate the loan agreement or call any or all outstanding loans at any time in its sole discretion. The ability of the Managing Owner and the
Selling Agent to continue to operate the Trust and Series J and to offer the Units may be adversely impacted in the event that UBS Loan Finance call any outstanding loan, terminates the loan agreement or refuses to make any loan to KHI. 
 


 

(19)
Unitholders Taxed Currently  Unitholders are
subject to tax each year on their allocable share of the income or gains (if any) of Series J, whether or not they receive distributions. Moreover, the Managing Owner does not intend to make any distributions to Unitholders in respect of Series J.
Consequently, Unitholders will be required either to redeem Units or to make use of other sources of funds to discharge their tax liabilities in respect of any profits earned by Series J.  In comparing the profit objectives of Series J with the performance of more familiar securities in which one might invest, prospective investors must
recognize that if they purchased equity or debt, there probably would be no tax due on the appreciation in the value of such holdings until disposition. In the case of Series J, on the other hand, a significant portion of any appreciation in the Net
Asset Value per Unit must be paid in taxes by the Unitholders every year, resulting in a substantial cumulative reduction in their net after-tax returns. Because Unitholders will be taxed currently on their allocable share of the income or gains of
Series J, if any, Series J may trade successfully but investors nevertheless would have recognized significantly greater gains on an after-tax basis had they invested in conventional stocks with comparable performance.  The performance information included in this Prospectus is presented exclusively on a pre-tax basis.   


 

(20)
Limitation on Deductibility of “Investment Advisory Fees”  Non-corporate Unitholders may be required to treat the amount of Incentive Fees and other expenses of Series J as “investment advisory fees” which may be subject to substantial restrictions on deductibility
for federal income tax purposes. In the absence of further regulatory or statutory clarification, the Managing Owner is not classifying these expenses as “investment advisory fees,” but this is a position to which the Internal Revenue
Service, the IRS, may object. If a substantial portion of the fees and other expenses of Series J were characterized as “investment advisory fees,” an investment in Series J might no longer be economically viable.   


 

(21)
Taxation of Interest Income Irrespective of Trading Losses  The Net Asset Value per Unit reflects the trading profits and losses as well as the interest income earned and expenses incurred by Series J. However, losses on Series J’s trading will be almost exclusively
capital losses, and capital losses are deductible against ordinary income only to the extent of $3,000 per year in the case of non-corporate taxpayers. Consequently, if a non-corporate Unitholder had, for example, an allocable trading (i.e.,
capital) loss of $10,000 in a given fiscal year and allocable interest (i.e., ordinary) income (after reduction for expenses) of $5,000, the Unitholder would have incurred a net loss in the Net Asset Value of such Unitholder’s Units
equal to $5,000 but would 
  
-20- 


Table of Contents

recognize taxable income of $2,000 (assuming a 40% tax rate). The limited deductibility of capital losses for non-corporate Unitholders could result in
such Unitholders having a tax liability in respect of their investment in Series J despite incurring a financial loss on their Units.   


 

(22)
Possibility of a Tax Audit of Both Series J and the Unitholders  There can be no assurance that the tax returns of Series J will not be audited by the IRS. If such an audit results in an adjustment, Unitholders could themselves be audited as well as being required to pay additional
taxes, interest and possibly penalties.  PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS AND COUNSEL WITH
RESPECT TO THE POSSIBLE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF AN INVESTMENT IN SERIES J; SUCH TAX CONSEQUENCES MAY DIFFER IN RESPECT OF DIFFERENT INVESTORS.   


 

(23)
Failure or Lack of Segregation of Assets May Increase Losses  The Commodity Exchange Act requires a futures commission merchant, or FCM or Clearing Broker, to segregate all funds received from customers from such broker’s proprietary assets. If the Clearing Broker fails to
do so, the assets of Series J might not be fully protected in the event of their bankruptcy. Furthermore, in the event of the Clearing Broker’s bankruptcy, Series J could be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available
funds segregated on behalf of the Clearing Broker’s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to Series J (for example, Treasury bills deposited by Series J with the Clearing Broker as margin) was held by
the Clearing Broker. The Clearing Broker has been the subject of certain regulatory and private causes of action. The material actions are described under “The Clearing Broker and Futures Broker.”  In the event of the FCM’s, bankruptcy, Series J may recover a pro-rata share or none of its assets.   


 

(24)
Default by Counterparty and Credit Risk Could Cause Substantial Losses  Dealers in forward contracts are not regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act and are not obligated to segregate customer assets. As a result, Unitholders do not have such basic protections with respect to the trading
in forward contracts by Series J. This lack of regulation in these markets could expose Series J in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by the counterparties.  Series J also faces the risk of non-performance by the counterparties to the over-the-counter contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to
these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. The
clearing member, clearing organization or other counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations, in which case Series J could suffer significant losses on these contracts.   


 

(25)
Regulatory Changes or Actions May Alter the Nature of an Investment in the Trust  Considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non-traditional investment pools, in particular commodity pools such as Series J,
publicly distributed in the United States. There has been significant international governmental concern expressed regarding, for example, (i) the disruptive effects of speculative trading on the central banks’ attempts to influence
exchange rates and (ii) the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general. There is a possibility of future regulatory changes altering, perhaps to a material extent, the nature of an investment in Series
J.  The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. In
addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the
establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. The regulation of futures and forward transactions in the United States is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. The effect
of any future regulatory change on the Trust is impossible to predict, but could be substantial and adverse.   
-21- 


Table of Contents


 

(26)
Trust Trading is Not Transparent  The
trading decisions in respect of Series J are made by one or more Advisors. While the Managing Owner receives daily trade confirmations from the Clearing Broker and foreign exchange dealers, such information is not provided to Unitholders and Series
J’s trading results are reported to the Unitholders monthly. Accordingly, an investment in Series J does not offer you the same transparency, i.e., an ability to review all investment positions daily, that a personal trading account
offers. The Managing Owner may (but is under no obligation to) provide estimated daily or weekly values to Unitholders.   


 

(27)
Lack of Independent Experts Representing Investors  The Managing Owner has consulted with counsel, accountants and other experts regarding the formation and operation of the Trust and Series J. No counsel has been appointed to represent you in connection with the offering of the Units.
Accordingly, you should consult your own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in Series J.   


 

(28)
Forwards, Swaps, Hybrids and Other Derivatives are Not Subject to CFTC Regulation  Series J may trade foreign exchange contracts in the interbank market. Since forward contracts are traded in unregulated markets between principals, the
commodity pools also assume the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance. In the future, Series J may also trade swap agreements, hybrid instruments and other off-exchange contracts. Swap agreements involve trading income streams such as fixed
rate or floating rate interest. Hybrids are instruments that combine features of a security with those of a futures contract. The dealer market for off-exchange instruments is becoming more liquid. Because there is no exchange or clearing house for
these contracts, the Trust will be subject to the credit risk and nonperformance of the counterparty. Additionally, because these off-exchange contracts are not regulated by the CFTC, Series J will not receive the protections that are provided by
the CFTC’s regulatory scheme.  There may be an additional risk due to the fact Series J may trade foreign exchange contracts
off-exchange and, as such, does not have protection of an exchange. There is also the additional risk that the assets held with the Clearing Broker for trading off-exchange foreign currencies are not required to be segregated.   


 

(29)
Foreign Exchange Currency Trading is Not Subject to CFTC Regulation  Certain Advisors (Graham and Ortus, in particular) will trade their programs by entering into spot and forward transactions involving currencies with United States and foreign banks and currency dealers. As with the
risks involved in forward contracts (see above), trading in spot and forward foreign exchange transactions is not regulated by the CFTC and such contracts are not traded on or guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house.   


 

(30)
Possibility of Termination of the Trust or Series J Before Expiration of its Stated Term  As managing owner, the Managing Owner may withdraw from the Trust upon 120 days’ notice, which would cause the Trust and each Series to terminate
unless a substitute managing owner were obtained. Other events, such as a long-term substantial loss suffered by Series J, could also cause such Series to terminate before the expiration of its stated term. This could cause you to liquidate your
investments and upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio. If the registrations with the CFTC or memberships in the NFA of the Managing Owner or the Clearing Broker were revoked or suspended, such entity would no longer be
able to provide services to the Trust.   


 

(31)
Losses by an Advisor Could Deplete All of the Assets of Series J, Including Assets that Were Allocated for Management by Another Advisor  Because Series J allocates its assets to Managed Accounts, it is theoretically possible that catastrophic losses by a single Advisor to a Managed Account
could deplete all the assets of Series J, even those assets that were allocated for management to other Advisors. Catastrophic losses by an Advisor to a Managed Account in excess of the amount of the assets allocated to such Advisor could occur as a
result of the high degree of embedded leverage in the instruments being traded and the trading strategies being employed by each of the Advisors. If such losses were to occur, they could be liabilities of Series J generally and all of the assets of
Series J could be available to the Trust’s creditors to satisfy claims attributable to the Advisor whose strategies resulted in such catastrophic losses.

Table of Contents

SERIES J AND ITS OBJECTIVES  
Objectives   


 
•
 
 Significant profits over time   


 
•
 
 Performance volatility commensurate with profit potential   


 
•
 
 Controlled risk of loss   


 
•
 
 Diversification within a traditional portfolio, typically consisting entirely of “long” equity and debt positions and reduced dependence on a single
nation’s economy, by accessing global financial, commodity and other non-financial futures markets.  Series
J’s potential for aggressive capital growth arises from the profit possibilities offered by the global futures, forward and options markets and the skills of the professional trading organization(s) selected to manage the assets of Series J.
The fact that Series J can profit from both rising and falling markets adds an element of profit potential that is not present in long-only strategies. However, Series J can also incur losses from both rising and falling markets that adds to the
risk of loss. In addition to its profit potential and risk of loss, Series J also could help reduce the overall volatility, or risk, of a portfolio. By investing in markets that operate independently from U.S. stock and bond markets (and therefore,
may be considered as non-correlated), Series J may provide positive returns even when U.S. stock and bond markets are experiencing flat to negative performance and may provide negative returns even when U.S. stock and bond markets are experiencing
flat to positive performance. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance would be exactly opposite between a Series and U.S. stock and bond markets.  Series J is structured to substantially eliminate the administrative burden that would otherwise be involved if you engaged directly in futures or
forward transactions. Among other things, you will receive directly from the Managing Owner monthly unaudited financial reports and an annual audited financial statement (setting forth, in addition to certain other information, the Net Asset Value
per Unit, trading profits or losses and the expenses of Series J for the period) as well as all tax information relating to Series J necessary for you to complete your federal income tax returns. The approximate Net Asset Value per Unit may be
available at times other than month-end from the Managing Owner upon request.  The Managing Owner makes no guarantee that the investment
objectives for Series J will be achieved.  
Investment Philosophy  Series J is managed by the Managing Owner:   


 
•
 
 selects Clearing Brokers and, in conjunction with the Selling Agent, selects Correspondent Selling Agents for Series J and selects the Advisor or Advisors for
Series J;   


 
•
 
 monitors the trading activity and performance of each Advisor for compliance with such Advisor’s own trading policies and risk control strategies;
  


 
•
 
 selects the Trust’s administrator and the Trust’s auditor;   


 
•
 
 determines if an Advisor should be removed or replaced;   


 
•
 
 negotiates advisory fees and brokerage commissions; and   


 
•
 
 performs such other services as the Managing Owner believes that Series J may from time to time require.  The Managing Owner believes that an effective means of controlling the risks of futures, forward and options trading is by using a portfolio of Advisors.
The Trust affords you an opportunity to maintain an equal exposure to each of the three Advisors, rebalanced quarterly. However, no assurance can be given that you will successfully diversify your exposure to these risks by purchasing Units of
Series J.  
Diversification  Market Diversification  As global markets and investing become more complex, the inclusion of professionally managed futures may continue to increase in traditional portfolios of
stocks and bonds managed by advisors seeking improved balance and diversification. The

globalization of the world’s economy has the potential to offer significant investment opportunities, as major political and economic events continue to
have an influence, in some cases a dramatic influence, on the world’s markets, creating risk but also providing the potential for profitable trading opportunities. By allocating a portion of the risk segment of their portfolios to selected
advisors specializing in futures, forward and options trading, investors have the potential, if their futures investments are successful, to enhance their prospects for improved performance as well as to reduce the volatility of their portfolios
over time and the dependence of such portfolios on any single nation’s economy.  Additionally, by utilizing three Advisors
simultaneously, Series J will provide multiple timing parameters and different sector focuses, producing a portfolio that may be quite different from that of a single-advisor fund.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

Table of Contents
Notes to Performance Information  In reviewing the descriptions of the performance of Series J, prospective investors should understand that such performance is “net” of all
fees and charges, and includes interest income.  Investors should also note that Bridgewater was the trading advisor for one-third of the
assets of Series J through April 30, 2007 and that Ortus was appointed as the trading advisor for such portion of Series J’s assets as of May 1, 2007. Therefore, you should not rely on the past performance of Series J as an indication
of future performance.   


1.
Worst Monthly Percentage Drawdown is the largest monthly percentage loss experienced by Series J in any calendar month covered by the performance summary. “Loss”
for these purposes is calculated on the basis of the loss experienced by Series J, expressed as a percentage of the total equity (including “notional” equity) of Series J. Worst Monthly Percentage Drawdown information includes the month
and year of such drawdown, and is as of February 29, 2008.   


2.
Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown is the largest percentage decline (after eliminating the effect of subscriptions and redemptions) experienced by Series J during the period
covered by the performance summary from any month-end Net Asset Value, without such month-end Net Asset Value being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent month-end. Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown is calculated on the basis of the loss experienced by
Series J, expressed as a percentage of the total equity (including “notional” equity) in Series J, and is as of February 29, 2008.  
MARKET FOR THE TRUST’S UNITS, DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE TRUST’S UNITS AND RELATED UNITHOLDER MATTERS  Information with respect to the offering of Interests and the use of proceeds is incorporated by reference to Note 1 to Series J’s 2007 audited financial statements, copies of which are included in this Prospectus.  A significant secondary market for the Limited Units has not developed, and is not expected to develop in the future. There are also certain restrictions
set forth in the Trust Agreement limiting the ability of a Unitholder to transfer Units. However, Limited Units may be redeemed on a monthly basis, but Class I Units are subject to a redemption fee if transacted within one year of the effective date
of purchase. Redemptions are calculated based on the then current Net Asset Value per Interest as of the close of business on the last business day of the month in which the redemption request is effected.  There are no material restrictions upon the Trust’s present or future ability to make distributions in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
Agreement. No distributions have been made since inception and no distributions are anticipated in the future.  As of February 1,
2008, there were 1,979 Series J Unitholders of record owning 777,088.80 Interests, which include 8,348.2323 General Units.  
SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  The following table presents selected financial data of Series J for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005. This data should be read in conjunction with Series J’s 2007 audited financial statement and the notes thereto,
copies of which are included in this Prospectus. Bridgewater was the trading advisor for one-third of the assets of Series J through April 30, 2007 and Ortus was appointed as the trading advisor for such portion of Series J’s assets as of
May 1, 2007. Therefore, you should not rely on the past performance of Series J set forth below as an indication of future performance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
Critical Accounting Policies  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. Series J’s application of these policies involves judgments
and actual results may differ from the estimates used.  The Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in
preparing Series J’s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments involves a critical accounting policy. The market values of futures (exchange traded) contracts is verified by the
Administrator, which obtains valuation data from third party data providers (such as Bloomberg and Reuters) and compares those prices with the Clearing Broker. The market value of currency swap and forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is
extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3pm on the last Business Day of the reporting period. All values assigned by the Administrator and confirmed by the Managing Owner are final and conclusive as to all Unitholders.
 As such, if actual results vary from estimates used, they are anticipated not to have a material impact on the financial statements and
related disclosures.  Series J records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a
component of trading profits (losses) in the Statements of Income (Loss). Generally, fair values are based on quoted market prices; however, in certain circumstances, significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining fair value in the
absence of an active market closing price.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources  General  As of the date of this Prospectus, 100% of Series J’s total net assets have been allocated to commodities and foreign exchange trading through the
Managed Accounts. A significant portion of the Net Asset Value is likely to be held in U.S. Treasury bills and cash, which will be used as margin for Series J’s trading in commodities and foreign exchange. The percentage that U.S. Treasury
bills will bear to the total net assets will vary from period to period as the market values of commodity interests change. The balance of the net assets will be held in Series J’s commodity or foreign exchange trading accounts. The Clearing
Broker credits Series J with interest on 100% of its average daily equity maintained in its accounts with the Clearing Broker during each month.  Series J’s commodities and foreign exchange contracts may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in certain
commodity futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as “daily limits.” During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract for a particular
commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the commodity can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Commodity futures prices have
occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent Series J from promptly liquidating its commodity futures positions.  Because Series J’s business is to trade futures and forward contracts, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market
risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk).  You should refer to Series J’s
2007 audited financial statement and the notes thereto, copies of which are included in this Prospectus, for a further discussion on the credit and market risks associated with Series J’s futures contracts.  Market Risk  Trading in
futures and forward contracts (including foreign exchange) involves Series J entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which will
typically be many times that of Series J’s Net Assets being traded, will significantly exceed Series J’s future cash requirements since Series J intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, Series J is
generally subject only to the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, Series J considers the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net

Table of Contents

unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk that is associated with Series J’s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross
or face amount of the contracts held. However, should Series J enter into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it would be required to make delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at
prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Because the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities will expose Series J to unlimited risk.  Series J’s exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors including the volatility of interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates, the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of Series J’s speculative trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could
result in monthly losses considerably beyond Series J’s experience to date and could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors’ capital.  Credit Risk  By entering into
futures or forward contracts, Series J is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and on most foreign futures exchanges is the
clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should
significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. There is
concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by Series J as Series J will utilize only one commodity broker. Series J has entered into a master netting agreement with the commodity broker and, as a result, will present unrealized gains
and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial position. The amount of risk associated with counterparty nonperformance of all of Series J’s contracts will be the net unrealized gain included in the statement
of financial condition; however, counterparty nonperformance on only certain of Series J’s contracts may result in greater loss than nonperformance on all of Series J’s contracts. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing
member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to Series J.  The Managing Owner attempts to minimize these market and credit risks by
requiring Series J and its Advisors to abide by various trading limitations and policies, which include limiting margin accounts, trading only in liquid markets and permitting the use of stop-loss provisions. The Managing Owner monitors compliance
with these trading limitations and policies that include, but are not limited to:   


 
•
 
 executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties;   


 
•
 
 limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined;   


 
•
 
 generally limiting transactions to contracts that will be traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions.
 Series J’s commodity broker, when acting as Series J’s futures commission merchant in accepting orders for the
purchase or sale of domestic futures and options on contracts, is required by Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to Series J, all assets of Series J relating to domestic
futures and options trading and the commodity broker is not allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the commodity broker. In addition, the CFTC regulations also require the commodity broker to secure assets of Series J related to
foreign futures and options trading. There are no segregation requirements for assets related to forward trading.  Series J does not have,
nor does it expect to have, any capital assets.  Series J  Series J commenced operations on December 1, 2005 with gross proceeds of $31,024,443 allocated to commodities trading. Additional contributions
raised through the continuous offering from the sales of Interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and the period December 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006 resulted in additional gross proceeds to
Series J of $68,449,410, $46,887,024 and $77,911,467, respectively.

Redemptions of Limited Interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006
and the period from December 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 were $14,894,690, $9,704,575 and $0, respectively. Redemptions of General Interests for the years ended December 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and the period from
December 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 were $0, $1,000 and $0, respectively.  Bridgewater was the trading advisor for one-third of
the assets of Series J through April 30, 2007, and Ortus was appointed as the trading advisor for such portion of Series J’s assets as of May 1, 2007. Therefore, you should not rely on the past performance of Series J as an indication
of future performance.  
Results of Operations  Market Commentary  Year Ended December 31, 2007  The global economy endured the
unfolding of the subprime credit crisis for most of 2007. August 2007 will forever be etched in the financial pantheon alongside 1998 and 1987 as defining events of their respective decades. The US economy has cooled considerably since the
beginning of the year and many economists are signifying a “recessionary like” outlook at best in the coming months, not the “soft landing” that was anticipated. While the US economy proved volatile throughout the year, the rest
of the world appeared to be going strong.  During 2007, single-family housing starts and permits hit sixteen-year lows as starts fell over
5% and are approximately 24% below 2006. The Home Builders Confidence Index witnessed the lowest drawdown in nineteen years. In November, UK housing prices showed their greatest monthly dive in twelve years as the subprime crisis clearly impacted
non-US markets. Inflation concerns led to the Bank of England, or BOE, to cut rates late in 2007.  In the US, the unemployment rate
unexpectedly jumped to 5.0% during the fourth quarter as private sector payrolls fell, signaling the first decline in four years. For the first time since September 2003, fewer than half of the industries surveyed added jobs.  Currencies  While the US
dollar managed periodic strength during December, the dollar ended 2007 with staggering losses to major rivals. The final 2007 tally saw the euro, pound and yen gaining over 10%, 6% and 2%, respectively. After witnessing a record monthly low in
November, the Dollar Index ended the year over 76.5. Throughout the year, emerging nations gained greater confidence in their domestic economic strength. Many, especially in Asia, slowly abandoned the managed dollar peg.  The pound finished the year with gains on the dollar, despite losses in December as a result of a BOE rate decrease. The euro had a strong year and
benefited from perceptions that the European Central Bank, or ECB, would not be lowering rates any time soon as ECB President Jean Claude Trichet issued a series of hawkish comments, mainly as related to inflation concerns. European Union economic
data was mixed to weak, including a twenty-two month low reading of the German IFO Business Confidence Index.  The yen closed out 2007 up
2% for the year on the US dollar. Japanese economic data persisted as lackluster and those calling for a rate increase have now mostly backed away from that forecast. The yuan extended its yearlong gradual advance in December as the Peoples Bank of
China continued to contract. Since abandonment of the US dollar peg in January 2005, the yuan has risen 12% to the dollar. The Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars posted gains on the year against the US dollar.  Energies  It was a tremendous
year for the petroleum sector as crude oil prices rose more than 40% within the Dow Jones AIG Index and closed 2007 over $95. Crude briefly reached the ominous $100 level but the market failed to hold that level in initial efforts. Geopolitical
events were supportive during the year, encouraging the high volatility patterns. Supply/demand fundamentals have been trending weaker and the market saw periodic selling as related to concerns surrounding slowing US and global growth. The US dollar
remained a key influence and the dollar’s demise was a key factor in crude’s run. Overall demand for commodities as an asset class was supportive, particularly in the Peoples Republic of China and in India.  Reformulated gasoline soared throughout the year and topped off with a year-to-date gain of over 45% within the Dow Jones AIG Index. Heating oil
performed well in 2007 and closed up 5.5% within the same index. Distillate inventories remained below the five-year average and Department of Energy

Table of Contents

inventories ran 6% under last year despite relatively moderate weather conditions.  Agriculturals  Clearly, 2007 was a superior year for commodities as
evidence by stronger readings in the major indices. The 19-component Dow Jones AIG Index witnessed a yearly gain of over 11%. Commodities attracted significant interest as an alternative asset class throughout 2007. Commodities closed the year at
prices that have not been seen since the summer of 1996. One key fundamental factor contributing to corn’s growth, besides the evident global demand for ethanol, is the increased quality of living in developing countries such as China and
India. On the production side, perhaps with the exception of soybeans, wherever crop interchangeability allows, corn will continue to steal acres from competing agricultural products.  Soybean prices finished the year over $12.50, which is second to historical highs set in June of 1973. The fundamentals for soybeans remain demand
driven. China’s need for beans, bean oil and bean meal is so massive that all importation taxes and tariffs on all three have been dropped, which is a rare move. On the supply side, the battle for global acreage will hinge on the relative value
of competing crops. In 2007, the wheat market realized an outstanding 87% increase in prices from 2006, setting new all time record prices. This gain is despite the historic drought in Australia, one of the world’s largest producers of the
grain. On the whole, cotton improved in 2007 ending the year with over a 22% increase, at a level that has not been seen since early 2004.  Indices  The major US equity indices slumped in the fourth quarter under the weight of the subprime credit crisis
but still tallied gains for the year. For 2007, the Dow Jones rose over 6%, the S&P 500 added 3.5%, while the tech heavy NASDAQ was the leading performer with a 10% gain. The fourth quarter sell-off was a result of traders becoming increasingly
concerned about the economy in general and housing in particular. Some doubted the Federal Reserves, or the Fed, resolve to address the economic issues in the face of growing inflation concerns. Also, interest and demand for commodities as an
alternative asset class weighed on the equity sector.  To a lesser extent, European equities echoed the weak tone of the US during the
fourth quarter. However, the German DAX showed strong gains of 22% during 2007. The CAC and FTSE scored much lower gains of 1% and 4%. The broad based Pan-European Dow Jones STOXX 600 suffered minor losses as markets outside of the big three
struggled.  Equities soared in Asia with the Hang Seng Index, Shanghai Composite, Kospi Index and Australian All Ordinaries setting record
highs during 2007. During the fourth quarter, volatility was rampant across Asian equities. While the Hang Seng performed extremely well, with almost a 40% gain on the year, it was a different story for Japan as the NIKKEI lost over 11%, resulting
in the first decline in the past five years. Despite the International Monetary Fund lowering Japan’s growth rate in November, business investment remained expansionary and many market participants view a Japanese recession as unlikely.
 Interest Rates  With inflation concerns and the global credit crisis taking center stage during the second half of the year, the Fed reacted aggressively on September 18 and cut both the Fed Funds rate by 50 basis points from 5.25% to 4.75% and the
discount rate to 5.25%. After this action, the yield curve showed significant steepening. The 2 and 10 year benchmark notes ended the year lower than 2006. The Federal Reserve indicated possible future US rate hikes in the coming months. The TED
spread continued to rise through November.  After a pair of rate hikes in the first half of the year, the ECB held steady at 4.00% through
year-end and the euro benefited from perceptions that the ECB seems to be in a holding pattern. The BOE issued three quarter-point rate increases in the first half of 2007. Forced to deal with the Northern Rock Crisis, declines in consumer
confidence, housing declines and weakness in the service sector during the second half of the year, the BOE slashed their rate by a quarter-point in December to end the year at 5.50%.  The Bank of Japan, or BOJ, raised rates in the first quarter of the year and held the rate steady through the end of the year. A rash of lackluster
economic data weighed on BOJ officials but they kept the rates unchanged. The Peoples Bank of China drained liquidity and gradually hiked interest rates throughout 2007.

Metals  Base metals had a rather difficult 2007. The dismal housing market, poor construction data in the US and UK and the sliding US dollar had a significant impact. Zinc was the worst performer among the nineteen
components of the Dow Jones AIG Index, with annual losses over 43%. Aluminum and nickel witnessed steep losses over 18% and 16% within the Dow Jones AIG Index, respectively. In December, copper had a rough month but still posted an annual gain of
over 4.5%.  Precious metals, on the other hand, recorded tremendous gains during 2007. Gold sky rocketed to a near twenty-eight year high
and finished 2007 up over 32%. This trend was fueled by the weak dollar, soaring oil prices, subprime credit woes and several geopolitical events, including the recent developments in Pakistan. Gold saw spotty selling per the yen carry trade and
other margin needs during the second half of the year. Silver traded with more volatility than gold and experienced less flight-to-safety demand and ended the year topping a 9% profit. Platinum had a positive year as Asian demand for the metal held
strong.  Softs and Livestock  Citrus finished up 2007 on the rally side following forecasts of freezing temperatures in the sunshine state. However, this rally could not offset losses realized throughout the year. Sugar and coffee had a rather
difficult year as well. Within the Dow Jones AIG Index sugar and coffee were down more than 14% and 6%, respectively. Following negative 2006 performance, cocoa rebounded in 2007, achieving a 17% return on the year.  2007 proved less than kind to livestock prices as both cattle and hogs suffered losses. Live cattle were down more than 6% within the Dow Jones AIG
Index. Korea rejected a series of shipments of US beef on trepidation of mad-cow disease concerns. Hogs were the second worst performer within the Dow Jones AIG Index with a 30% loss.  Year Ended December 31, 2006  General Economy
 The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) ceased raising rates in the fourth quarter. The perception remains that although the economy is
slowing, there is no danger of a recession and that a soft landing is the most likely scenario. Range trading may be the dominant pattern for the next few months as prices react to the economic data. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-Year note
finished November at an 11-month low. A weaker U.S. dollar failed to dampen enthusiasm for U.S. Treasuries. The latest data available shows capital flows to the U.S. rose in October.  On the employment front, job growth accelerated in December as non-farm payrolls rose while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5%. This is down from
4.9% at the start of 2006. Of some concern was a 0.5% jump in average hourly earnings, taking them up 4.2% over the past 12 months. Overall, the employment picture persists as healthy but the construction, manufacturing and retail sectors all lost
jobs in December.  Regarding U.S. inflation, the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) was unchanged and the Core CPI, which factors out the
more volatile food and energy prices, was also flat. This is the lowest reading for the core rate since November 2005. There were clearly no inflation worries in this data. The Producer Price Index (PPI) was not as controlled, climbing 2.0%, the
most since 1974. The surge was caused by a jump in energy, car and truck prices.  Housing has been a major economic concern in
2006. November Housing Starts rose following a big drop in October. November Housing Permits, however, fell slightly. Over the past 11 months, Housing Starts were 12.5% below 2005 levels while Housing Permits were off 14.1%. Homebuilders’
confidence, as indicated by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Index fell in December.  The overall consumer confidence picture remained mixed with the
high end and electronics sectors doing well. November Retail Sales rose 1.0%. The unusually warm weather hurt clothing sales in department stores. Third quarter Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic growth, was revised downwards to the
lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2005. Home building remains the main drag on growth.  While the Fed was on hold with respect to
interest rate policy, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE) and the Peoples Bank of China (PBC) all raised interest rates. British housing prices and CPI growth continue to be high. Germany continues to exhibit growth, and leads
the increasingly strong Eurozone. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) remained cautious, with no additional rate hikes following the July increase to 0.25%. The

economy appears mixed, with consumer spending still less than the economy requires. The Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia and New Zealand central
bank all remained on hold in December.  Currencies  The euro strengthened versus the U.S. dollar in 2006, reversing the pattern from 2005. The euro also strengthened against the Japanese yen, achieving
record levels in December. Germany, the engine of Eurozone growth, has been the strongest European economy this year. Interest rate differential factors supported the euro through much of the fourth quarter of 2006. Of great significance, central
banks around the globe have initiated a policy of diversification out of the U.S. dollar and into the euro, the British pound, and to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen.  The British pound ended the year slightly off its high, after rising approximately 14% versus the U.S. dollar. British housing prices have been surging and the CPI came in above the BOE’s target.  The Japanese yen fell against the U.S. dollar, euro and British pound during the fourth quarter of 2006. Japan exited its deflationary era in 2006,
although the fourth quarter saw less than robust growth on the consumer side. Other Asian currencies were better performers, with the Korean won having a particularly solid December and fourth quarter.  The Peoples Bank of China continues to tighten the reins on the economy. Most recently, the PBC increased the reserve requirement ratio for banks and
raised the base interest rate 50 points to 6.72%. The yuan has shown an accumulative appreciation of about 3.7% since the July 2005 revaluation.  Energies  Crude oil was strong during the first half of the year and weakened during the second half, with the
exception of a brief respite during November. Crude ended December around $60 per barrel, which contrasts to its mid-July peak of nearly $78 per barrel. Record warm weather in key consuming regions in the U.S. put pressure on the market during the
fourth quarter, as did a generally benign geopolitical scene and poor member compliance with OPEC’s announced production cuts.  The
unusually warm weather kept heating oil under pressure during December. Heating oil will be dependent on a general recovery in commodity prices and a sudden weather shift in coming weeks. Department of Energy gasoline inventories are 0.5% below last
season. The driving season was extended by the warm weather conditions.  Natural gas fell during the fourth quarter with the weather
weighing heavily on investor sentiment. Inventories are still burdensome and demand is slowing rather than rising during the normally strong seasonal demand time frame. What remains to be seen is whether the markets have discounted the majority of
these bearish fundamentals.  Grains  While December’s performance was mixed, corn trended upwards for the fourth quarter as a whole. The last week of the month, quarter, and year saw the posting of a multi-year high, with the final price for 2006
settling at the highest weekly close on the charts since the drought-driven summer rally in July of 1996. The main drivers behind the re-awakening of corn prices were threefold: 1) an increase in overseas demand due to improving global economic
conditions; 2) the expansion of the production of ethanol; and 3) the ongoing increase in hedge fund and money managers’ investing in alternative non-correlated asset classes. For the quarter as a whole, despite a large trading range, the wheat
market put in somewhat disappointing, albeit upward trending performance. The uncertainty caused by ongoing drought conditions in Australia, the relatively high price for wheat and tight global stocks had an effect on supply and demand. The trend
for soybean prices was higher for the fourth quarter of 2006. Export demand for soybeans, soybean oil and soybean meal all appear to be increasing. As corn production is increasingly diverted to the production of ethanol, substitute feedstuffs, with
soybeans as the closest surrogate, may also feel the upward pull of prices. As the global supply of foreign cotton sold out late in the year, prices began to move higher from mid-November through the end of the year. The lethargy that characterized
most of 2006 was a product of a massive carryover of last year’s crop, along with last summer’s unfortunate elimination of a marketing program which left U.S. cotton uncompetitively priced.  Indices  U.S. equities
recorded their best gains in three years during the fourth quarter of 2006. The weakness in real estate that may have caused a shift into equities, large levels of global liquidity, a drop in oil prices, a quiet geopolitical atmosphere, solid

earnings and a brisk mergers and acquisitions calendar all added to the positive performance. A shift out of commodities also aided the tone of global
equities. Blue chips, financials, oil and big caps did well, and at the end of the quarter technology names took a leading role.  It was
also a very good December, fourth quarter and year for the European equity markets. Markets in Germany, the U.K. and France all ended higher for the fourth quarter. Heavy merger and acquisition activity was a major feature in Europe, along with a
solid run of earnings and significant fund inflows. The strong U.S. market was also a psychological plus. The prospect of further rate hikes from the ECB, and to a lesser extent the BOE, failed to diminish enthusiasm.  Asian/Pacific Rim equities also recorded solid 2006 gains, despite volatile trading. Record highs were achieved in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand
during the final session of the year as well as for China’s Shanghai Composite. A growing Japanese economy served to buoy enthusiasm and a modest 0.25% base interest rate was supportive. Thailand’s SET Index had a very volatile month after
the central bank attempted to impose controls on capital for foreign investors in the stock market, but that was quickly reversed when the SET tumbled 15%, and prices subsequently recovered. However, Thailand has seen continuing political unrest.
 Interest Rates  As expected, the Fed remained on hold at its December 12 meeting. The minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting were virtually the same as the November meeting, indicating that the FOMC unanimously agreed
that inflation persists as the primary concern to the economy. However, at the same time they stated the economy might have been a bit softer than previously thought.  In the international arena, the ECB increased rates 25 basis points in December and the BOE raised rates 25 basis points in November. The BOJ made just one move to 0.25% in 2006. Japanese consumer data has been a bit
sluggish; something the BOJ will keep in focus. The Peoples Bank of China is currently engaged in a tightening process, and is actively draining liquidity by increasing reserve requirements.  Metals  A weak U.S. dollar helped support gold for most of the quarter
but during late December the dollar showed signs of a consolidation rally and gold fell. Plunging energy prices had a negative impact on gold prices as well. Silver traded at its best levels in more than six months during the quarter, but ended the
year off its highs. For the year, silver significantly outperformed gold. Speculative participation was heavy throughout the quarter, setting the stage for high volatility. A steady increase in inventories weighed on copper prices in the fourth
quarter. A lessening of labor concerns, particularly in Chile and Canada, and the fact that China’s buying pace slowed in 2006 added to the negative tone. Zinc supplies remained tight and strong demand continued. Aluminum prices held up well in
the fourth quarter in the face of a general commodity weakness. Nickel was one of the strongest performers in the metals group due to tight supply and a strong pattern of stainless steel demand.  Softs  Forecasts for a
significant global supply surplus of sugar weighed on sentiment, causing prices to decline 29% on the year. This made sugar the weakest agricultural commodity in the Dow Jones/AIG Index. Coffee prices remained relatively flat for 2006 and overall
global coffee demand was solid. Scaled back cocoa crop prospects for the Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer, added to the commodity’s recent bullish tone. The political situation in the Ivory Coast continues fairly quiet but civil
unrest remains a potential factor. The cattle market traded sideways for most of the fourth quarter until severe weather conditions reduced cattle supply and caused prices to rise in the second half of December. Hog supply was ample during the
quarter as the US entered a seasonally slow demand period. On the bright side, the most recent USDA estimate is that US pork exports will rise in 2007 to follow the 2006 increase.  Year Ended December 31, 2005  2005 was an eventful year in the
global economic markets. The rise in global energy prices to historic highs was a primary factor that dominated the global economy, along with many other economic, geopolitical and social issues.  The U.S. equity markets lagged most foreign equity markets in 2005. The Dow Jones Industrial Index had its first annual loss since 2002, while the

technology oriented Nasdaq Index had a modest 1% gain and the S&P 500 Index gained 3% for the year. Overall corporate earnings exceeded expectations for
most of the year, including the third and fourth quarters. The impact of several hurricanes, high energy prices and rising interest rates were among the negative factors for the year.  European equity markets out-performed the U.S. equity markets by a significant margin for much of the year, with the fourth quarter being particularly
strong. Among the three major indices, the German DAX gained 27%, the French CAC 40 gained 23% and the British FTSE 100 was up 17%. Asian equities were stronger than European equities, as South Korea’s Kospi increased 54% and Japan’s
Nikkei rose 40%. The Nikkei finished the year with seven consecutive monthly gains. Australia’s All Ordinaries increased 17%.  One of
the notable themes in U.S. interest rates was a flattening yield curve and a gradual trend toward inversion. The inversion finally occurred in December as the 10-year finished with a 4.39% yield versus 4.40% for the 2-year. The inversion was the
first in six years. This pattern occurred in the face of 13 consecutive 25 point Federal Open Market Committee rate hikes to 4.25%. In Europe, the European Central Bank raised rates 25 points to 2.25% but this was not considered an indication of a
cycle of rate hikes as European economic growth, while improved, remained fairly modest.  The U.S. dollar ended stronger in 2005, not
withstanding a volatile trading pattern during the year. For the year, the U.S. dollar rose approximately 15% against the Japanese yen and the Euro. The interest rate differential was the primary factor behind the U.S. dollar’s solid
performance. The British pound finished 2005 lower due to weakness in the U.K. economy. As a result of rate increases by the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar gradually gained versus the U.S. dollar, ending the year up 4.1%. The Australian dollar
declined in 2005 despite rate hikes and strong equity markets. The Russian ruble decreased approximately 3.4% for the year. The full impact of the revaluation of the Chinese renminbi at midyear has yet to be realized.  Crude oil and related products were among the largest gainers in the commodities markets for 2005. Energy prices peaked in the summer, around the time of
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and declined in October and November. Weather was a contributing influence to the decrease as above normal temperatures continued through the end of the year. Global demand, however, was ever increasing, with China and
India in the forefront.  In the metals, gold prices steadily advanced in 2005, particularly in the final quarter of the year. Strong
physical and investment demand, particularly from the Far East, was a yearlong feature. European central banks were reserved sellers and a number of other central banks, such as Russia and OPEC nations, increased the amount of gold in their reserve
asset portfolios. Additionally, gold assumed the role as an alternative currency in 2005 as traders shied away from the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Euro. Silver prices tracked gold for much of the year due to strong physical demand from India in
particular. In the base metals, copper prices rose significantly as strong Chinese demand remained a driving force throughout the year.

value, or NAV, per Interest of Class I as of December 31, 2007 was $105.40, an increase of 7.33% from the December 31, 2006 NAV per Interest of $98.20, which was an increase of 0.84% from the December 31, 2005 Net Asset Value per
Interest of $97.38, and which in turn was a decrease of 2.62% from the December 1, 2005 Net Asset Value per Interest of $100.00. The Net Asset Value per Interest of Class II as of December 31, 2007 was $105.76, an increase of 9.36% from
the December 31, 2006 NAV per Interest of $96.71, which was a decrease of 3.29% from the beginning Net Asset Value per Interest of $100.00 as of the start of trading on May 1, 2006. The CISDM CPO Asset Weighted Index (formerly known as the
Zurich Fund/Pool Qualified Universe Index) returned for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and for the one-month ended December 31, 2005 were approximately 8.55%, 8.30% and (0.57)%, respectively. The CISDM CPO Asset Weighted Index is
the dollar weighted, total return of all commodity pools tracked by Managed Account Reports, LLC. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  Registrant’s average net assets during the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately $72,697,000. Registrant’s net assets increased by approximately $18,042,000 during 2007 as compared to 2006 and
increased by approximately $24,038,000 during 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase in average net assets during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was due to new subscriptions and net income.

Registrant’s trading gains (losses) before commissions and related fees for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005 were approximately $10,112,000, $2,277,000 and $(733,000), respectively. A detailed discussion of the trading results for the
year ended December 31, 2007 is presented below.  Interest income is earned on the average daily equity maintained in its accounts at
competitive interest rates and, therefore, varies monthly according to interest rates, trading performance, contributions and redemptions. Interest income during the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately $3,053,000, which was increased
by approximately $447,000 during 2007 as compared to 2006, increased by approximately $2,337,000 during 2006 as compared to the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005. During the period December 1,
2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005, interest income includes interest earned on subscription monies held in escrow prior to December 1, 2005. The increase in interest income during the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006 was due to increased average net assets.  Commissions and other transaction fees, which consist of NFA, exchange and clearing fees
as well as floor brokerage costs and give-up charges, are based on the number of trades the Trading Advisors execute, as well as which exchange, clearing firm or bank on, or through, which the contract is traded. Commissions and other transaction
fees during the year ended December 31, 2007 was approximately $318,000, which decreased by approximately $42,000 as compared to 2006, increased by approximately $333,000 in 2006 as compared to the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of
operations) to December 31, 2005. The decrease in commissions during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due to reduced trading costs and the increase in commissions during the year ended December 31, 2006 was due to a full year of
trading activity in 2006.  All trading decisions for Registrant are made by the Trading Advisors (either directly or through the Trading
Vehicles). Trading Advisor fees are calculated on the portion of Registrant’s net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor at the end of each month, and therefore, are affected by monthly trading performance, contributions and redemptions.
Management fees to the trading advisors during the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $1,689,000, which increased by approximately $262,000 during 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately $1,364,000 during 2006 as
compared to the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005. The increase in Management fees during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due to increased average net assets. The increase in Management
fees during the year ended 2006 was due to a full year of trading activity in 2006.  Registrant pays the Managing Owner a management fee
calculated on Registrant’s Net Asset Value at the beginning of each month, and therefore, such fee is affected by monthly trading performance, contributions and redemptions. Management fees to the Managing Owner during the year ended
December 31, 2007 were approximately $368,000, which increased by approximately $85,000 during 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased by approximately $270,000 during 2006 as compared to the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of
operations) to December 31, 2005. The increase in Management fees to the Managing Owner during the years ended 2007 and 2006 was due to increased average net assets and a full year of trading activity in 2006 respectively  Registrant pays a service fee with respect to Class I Units, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12 of
2% (2% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Class I Units as of the beginning of the month. The service fee is paid directly by Registrant to the Selling Agent, Kenmar Securities Inc., an affiliate of the Managing Owner. The
Selling Agent is responsible for paying all service fees owing to the correspondent selling agents, who are entitled to receive from the Selling Agent an initial service fee equal to 2% of the initial Net Asset Value per Unit of each Class I Unit
sold by them, payable on the date such Class I Units are purchased and, commencing with the 13th month after the purchase of a Class I unit, an
ongoing monthly service fee equal to 1/12th of 2% (2% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the beginning of the month of the Class I
Units sold by them. All Unitholders will also pay Kenmar Securities Inc. a monthly sales commission equal to 1/12 of 1% (1% annually) of the Net Asset Value of the outstanding Units as of the beginning of each month. Service fees and sales
commissions during the year ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $1,378,000 and $737,000, respectively. Service fees and sales commissions during the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $1,105,000 and $567,000,
respectively and $52,000 and $26,000, respectively, for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of

operations) to December 31, 2005. The increase of service fees and sales commissions was approximately $273,000 and $170,000 during 2007 as compared to
2006 due to increased average net assets.  Incentive fees are based on the “New High Net Trading Profits” generated by the
Trading Advisors, as defined in the Advisory Agreements between Registrant (either directly or through the Trading Vehicles) and the Trading Advisors. Incentive fees were approximately $2,186,000 and $594,000 for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Incentive fees were $0 for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005.  Operating expenses were approximately $537,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007, which is an increase of approximately $112,000 from $425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006, due to increased average net assets. Operating
expenses were approximately $155,000 for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005. These expenses include accounting, audit, registrar, and transfer agent, tax and legal fees as well as printing and
postage costs related to reports sent to Limited Interests.  Offering costs were approximately $368,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2007, which is an increase of approximately $83,000 from $285,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to increased average net assets. Offering costs were approximately $13,000 for the period December 1, 2005
(commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005. Offering costs are advanced by the Managing Owner and subject to reimbursement by the Trust, subject to certain limitations. For a further discussion of these payments, see Note 2.E. of
Registrant’s 2007 Annual Report.  Bridgewater was the trading advisor for one-third of the assets of Series J through April 30,
2007, and Ortus was appointed as the trading advisor for such portion of Series J’s assets as of May 1, 2007. Therefore, you should not rely on the past performance of Series J as an indication of future performance.  
Inflation  Inflation has had no material impact on operations or on the financial condition of Series J for
the years ended December 31, 2007 or December 31, 2006 or for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2005.  
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  As of the date of this Prospectus, Series J has not utilized, nor does Series J expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate
off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no loan guarantee arrangements or off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related
to certain risks service providers, such as Series J’s accountants, undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of Series J. While Series J’s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these
general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on Series J’s financial position.  Series J’s
contractual obligations are with the Advisors and the commodity brokers. Payments made under the Trust’s agreements with the Advisors are a fixed rate, calculated as a percentage of Series J’s “New High Net Trading Profits.”
Management Fee payments made to the Managing Owner are calculated as a fixed percentage of Series J’s Net Asset Value. Commission payments to the commodity broker are on a contract-by-contract, or round-turn, basis. As such, the Managing Owner
cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as Net Asset Values are not known until a future date. These agreements are effective for one-year terms, renewable automatically for
additional one-year terms unless terminated. Additionally, these agreements may be terminated by either party for various reasons.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
Introduction  Past Results Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance  Series J is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and substantially all
of Series J’s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to Series J’s main line of business.  Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair market value of Series J’s open positions and, consequently, in Series J’s earnings and
cash flow. Series J’s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the
diversification effects among Series J’s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.  Series J rapidly
acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular futures market scenario will affect performance, and Series J’s past performance is not
necessarily indicative of its future results.  Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Trust could reasonably be
expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of Series J’s speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by Series J of market movements far exceeding expectations could result in actual trading or
non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Trust’s experience to date (i.e., “risk of ruin”). In light of the foregoing, as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the
quantification included in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Trust’s losses in any market sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Trust’s attempts to manage its market
risk.  Standard of Materiality  Materiality as used in this section is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage, optionality and multiplier features of Series
J’s market sensitive instruments.  
Quantifying Series J’s Trading Value at Risk  Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements 
The following quantitative disclosures regarding Series J’s market risk exposures contain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934).  Series J’s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded by the Advisors are quantified below in terms of Value at
Risk. Due to Series J’s mark-to-market accounting, any loss in the fair value of Series J’s open positions is directly reflected in Series J’s earnings (realized or unrealized) and cash flow (at least in the case of exchange-traded
contracts in which profits and losses on open positions are settled daily through variation margin).  Exchange maintenance margin
requirements have been used by Series J as the measure of its Value at Risk. Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in
95%-99% of any one-day interval. The maintenance margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given
futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation. Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial
margin includes a credit risk component, which is not relevant to Value at Risk.  In the case of market sensitive instruments that are not
exchange-traded (almost exclusively currencies in the case of Series J), the margin requirements for the equivalent futures positions have been used as Value at Risk. In those rare cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available,
dealers’ margins have been used.

In quantifying Series J’s Value at Risk, 100% positive correlation in the different positions held
in each market risk category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine each trading category’s aggregate Value at Risk. The diversification effects
resulting from the fact that the Trust’s positions are rarely, if ever, 100% positively correlated have not been reflected.  Series
J’s Trading Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors  The following table presents the trading value at risk associated with
Series J’s open positions by market sector at December 31, 2007 and 2006. All open position trading risk exposures of Series J have been included in calculating the figure set forth below. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, Series J had
total capitalization of approximately $79 million, and $67 million, respectively.

 Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk  The notional value of the market sector instruments held by Series J is typically many times the applicable maintenance margin requirement (maintenance
margin requirements generally range between approximately 1% and 10% of the face value) as well as many times the total capitalization of Series J. The magnitude of Series J’s open positions creates a “risk of ruin” not typically
found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of its positions, certain market conditions, although unusual, but historically recurring from time to time, could cause Series J to incur severe losses over a short period of time. The
foregoing Value at Risk table, as well as the past performance of Series J give no indication of this “risk of ruin.”  Non-Trading Risk  Series J has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these
balances (as well as any market risk they represent) are immaterial.  
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures  The following qualitative disclosures
regarding Series J’s market risk exposures — except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how Series J manages its primary market risk exposures — constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Series J’s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used
by the Managing Owner and the Advisors for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks are one of which could cause the actual results of Series J’s risk controls to differ materially from the
objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market
participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of Series J. There can be no assurance that Series J’s current
market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be

prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in Series J.  Based on average trading value at risk during the year ended December 31, 2007, Series J experienced a decrease in its value at risk, relative to
capitalization levels, as compared with the value at risk at December 31, 2006. The decrease was a portfolio-wide occurrence with the exception of currencies. The value at risk in the stock index sector declined the most, followed by a decrease
in interest rates and commodities.  
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure  The means by which the Managing Owner and
the Advisors, severally, attempt to manage the risk of Series J’s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded.  The Advisors attempt to minimize market risk exposure by applying their own risk management trading policies, which include the diversification of trading assets into various market sectors. Additionally, the Advisors have an oversight
committee broadly responsible for evaluating and overseeing the Advisors’ trading policies. The oversight committee meets periodically to discuss and analyze issues such as liquidity, position size, capacity, performance cycles, and new product
and market strategies.  The Managing Owner attempts to minimize market risk exposure by requiring the Advisors to abide by various trading
limitations and policies. The Managing Owner monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies which include, but are not limited to, limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined
and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions. Additionally, the Managing Owner shall automatically terminate an Advisor to Series J if the Net Asset Value of
the assets allocated to such Advisor declines by 40% during any year or since the commencement of trading activities. Furthermore, the Trust Agreement provides that the Trust or, as the case may be, Series J will liquidate its positions, and
eventually dissolve, if the Trust or Series J experiences a decline in the Net Asset Value of 50% in any year or since the commencement of trading activities. In each case, the decline in Net Asset Value is after giving effect for distributions,
contributions and redemptions. The Managing Owner may impose additional restrictions (through modifications of such trading limitations and policies) upon the trading activities of the Advisors as it, in good faith, deems to be in the best interest
of the Trust or Series J.  
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposures  At December 31, 2007, Series J’s
primary exposure to non-trading market risk resulted from foreign currency balances held in the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Australian dollars and Canadian dollar. As discussed above, these balances, as well as any risk they represent, are
immaterial.  At December 31, 2006, Series J’s primary exposure to non-trading market risk resulted from foreign currency balances
held in the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Australian dollars and Canadian dollar. As discussed above, these balances, as well as any risk they represent, are immaterial.  
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure  On September 14,
2007, the Board of Directors of the Managing Owner dismissed Deloitte & Touche LLP, or D&T, as the registered public accounting firm for the Trust.  The reports of D&T on the Trust’s financial statements as of and for the two most recent fiscal years (ending December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005) did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainties, audit scope, or accounting principles.  During the
Trust’s two most recent fiscal years (ending December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005) and during the period from the end of the most recently completed fiscal year through September 19, 2007, the Trust has had no disagreements
with D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&T, would have caused it to make a reference to the
subject matter thereof in its report on the financial statements of the Trust for such periods. During the two most recent fiscal years (ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005) and through September 19, 2007, there were no
reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).

Table of Contents
On October 15, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Managing Owner, approved the engagement of Eisner
LLP, or Eisner, as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust. During the Trust’s two most recent fiscal years and the interim period prior to engaging Eisner, neither the Trust, the Managing Owner, nor anyone on their
behalf consulted Eisner, on behalf of the Trust, regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction (either completed or proposed), the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Trust’s financial statements,
or any matter that was either the subject of a “disagreement,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, or a “reportable event,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
THE ADVISORS  
General  All direct investment decisions for Series J are made by the three Advisors selected and monitored
by the Managing Owner. The assets of Series J are allocated equally among the three Advisors and rebalanced quarterly. Each current Advisor is, and it is anticipated that any subsequent Advisor, if any, will be, registered with and regulated by the
CFTC or exempt from such registration. The registration of any Advisor with the CFTC and its membership in the NFA must not be construed to mean that any regulatory body has recommended or approved the Advisor or Series J.  Although the following descriptions of each of the Advisors and their trading methods and strategies are general and are not intended to be
exhaustive, such descriptions address the material aspects of each Advisor’s program that is offered by the Trust. Trading methods are proprietary and complex, so only the most general descriptions are possible. Furthermore, certain Advisors
may have chosen to refer to specific aspects of their trading systems, methods and strategies, which aspects may also be applicable to other Advisors which did not choose to make explicit reference to these aspects of their own strategies. As a
result, contrasts in the descriptions set forth herein may not, in fact, indicate a substantive difference between the trading methods and strategies involved. While the Managing Owner believes that the description of the Advisors’ methods and
strategies included herein may be of interest to prospective investors, such persons must be aware of the inherent limitations of such description.  This section contains brief biographical outlines and performance summaries of the Series J’s Advisors. The success of Series J is dependent upon the success of the Advisors retained by or on behalf of Series J
from time to time to trade for its account. In terms of attempting to reach an investment decision regarding Series J, however, it is difficult to know how to assess Advisor descriptions and performance summaries, as trading methods are proprietary
and confidential and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Furthermore, the performance summaries provide only a brief overview of the Advisors’ performance histories and have not been audited.  To the best of the Managing Owner’s knowledge, none of the Advisors or their principals owns any Units in Series J.  Certain Advisors trade “notional” equity for clients — i.e., trading such clients’ accounts as if more equity were committed to
such accounts than is, in fact, the case. Series J’s accounts may, at the Managing Owner’s discretion, permit the Advisors to trade the accounts on a basis that includes notional equity.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. FURTHERMORE, THE RATES OF RETURN EARNED WHEN AN ADVISOR IS MANAGING A LIMITED AMOUNT OF
EQUITY MAY HAVE LITTLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE RATES OF RETURN THAT SUCH ADVISOR MAY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE MANAGING LARGER AMOUNTS OF EQUITY.  THE
ADVISORS’ PERFORMANCE SUMMARIES APPEARING IN THIS PROSPECTUS HAVE IN NO RESPECT BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE CHARGES TO THE TRUST. CERTAIN OF THE ACCOUNTS INCLUDED IN SUCH PERFORMANCE SUMMARIES PAID FEES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND IN SOME
CASES MATERIALLY LOWER THAN, THOSE CHARGED TO THE TRUST.  TRADING OF FUTURES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS IS SPECULATIVE
AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ADVISORS WILL TRADE PROFITABLY OR AVOID INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES.

Futures and Foreign Exchange Trading Methods in General  Systematic and Discretionary Trading
Approaches  Futures and foreign exchange traders may generally be classified as either systematic or discretionary.  A systematic trader will generally rely to some degree on judgmental decisions concerning, for example, what markets to follow and commodities to trade,
when to liquidate a position in a contract which is about to expire and how large a position to take in a particular commodity. However, although these judgmental decisions may have a substantial effect on a systematic trader’s performance, his
primary reliance is on trading programs or models that generate trading signals. The systems utilized to generate trading signals are continuously evolving, but the trading instructions generated by the systems being used are followed without
significant additional analysis or interpretation. Discretionary traders, while they may utilize market charts, computer programs and compilations of quantifiable fundamental information to assist them in making trading decisions, make such
decisions on the basis of their own judgment and “trading instinct,” not on the basis of trading signals generated by any program or model.  Each approach involves certain inherent risks. Systematic traders may fail to capitalize on market trends that their systems would otherwise have exploited due to judgmental decisions made by them in the context of
applying their generally mechanical trading systems. Discretionary traders may decide to make trades which would not have been signaled by a trading system and which result in substantial losses. Furthermore, any trading system or trader may suffer
substantial losses by misjudging the market. Systematic traders tend to rely more on computerized programs than do discretionary traders. In addition, due to their use of computers, systematic traders are generally able to incorporate more data into
a particular trading decision than are discretionary traders. However, when fundamental factors dominate the market, trading systems may suffer rapid and severe losses due to their inability to respond to such factors until such factors have had a
sufficient effect on the market to create a trend of enough magnitude to generate a reversal of trading signals, by which time a precipitous price change may already be in progress, preventing liquidation at anything but substantial losses.
 Technical and Fundamental Analysis  In addition to being distinguished from one another by the criterion of whether they trade systematically or on the basis of their discretionary evaluations of the markets, trading advisors are also distinguished as
relying on either “technical” or “fundamental” analysis, or on a combination of the two. Systematic traders tend to rely on technical analysis, because the data relevant to such analysis is more susceptible to being isolated and
quantified to the extent necessary to be successfully incorporated into a program or mathematical model than is most “fundamental” information, but there is no inconsistency in attempting to trade systematically on the basis of fundamental
analysis. The fundamental information that can be evaluated by a formalized trading system is, however, limited to some extent in that it generally must be quantifiable in order to be processed by such a system.  Technical analysis is not based on anticipated supply and demand factors; instead, it is based on the theory that the study of the commodities markets
themselves will provide a means of anticipating future prices. Technical analysis operates on the theory that market prices at any given point in time reflect all known factors affecting the supply and demand for a particular commodity.
Consequently, technical analysis focuses not on evaluating those factors directly but on an analysis of market prices themselves, theorizing that a detailed analysis of, among other things, actual daily, weekly and monthly price fluctuations, volume
variations and changes in open interest is the most effective means of attempting to predict the future course of price movements.  Fundamental analysis, in contrast, is based on the study of factors external to the trading markets that affect the supply and demand of a particular commodity in an attempt to predict future price levels. Such factors might include
weather, the economy of a particular country, government policies, domestic and foreign political and economic events, and changing trade prospects. Fundamental analysis theorizes that by monitoring relevant supply and demand factors for a
particular commodity, a state of current or potential disequilibrium of market conditions may be identified that has yet to be reflected in the price level of that commodity. Fundamental analysis assumes that markets are imperfect, that information
is not instantaneously assimilated or disseminated and that econometric models can be constructed that generate equilibrium prices that may indicate that current prices are

inconsistent with underlying economic conditions and will, accordingly, change in the future.  Trend-Following  “Trend-following” traders gear their trading approaches towards positioning themselves to take advantage of major price movements, as opposed to traders who seek to achieve overall profitability by making numerous small profits on
short-term trades, or through arbitrage techniques. “Trend-following” traders assume that most of their trades will be unprofitable. Their objective is to make a few large profits, more than offsetting their more numerous but smaller
losses, from capitalizing on major trends. Consequently, during periods when no major price trends develop in a market, a “trend-following” trader is likely to incur substantial losses.  Risk Control Techniques  An important
aspect of any speculative futures strategy relates to the control of losses, not only the ability to identify profitable trades. Unless it is possible to avoid major drawdowns, it is very difficult to achieve long-term profitability.  Traders often adopt fairly rigid “risk management” or “money management” principles. Such principles typically restrict the size of
positions that will be taken as well as establish “stop-loss” points at which losing positions must be liquidated. It is important for prospective investors to recognize in reading the descriptions of the Advisors’ various risk
control techniques that none is “fail safe,” and none can, in fact, assure that major drawdowns will be avoided. Not only do estimates of market volatility themselves require judgmental input, but also market illiquidity can make it
impossible for an account to liquidate a position against which the market is moving strongly, whatever risk management principles are utilized. Similarly, irrespective of how small the initial “probing” positions taken by an Advisor are,
unless it trades profitably, innumerable small losses incurred in the course of such “probing” can quickly accumulate into a major drawdown. The Advisors’ risk management principles should, accordingly, be seen more as a discipline
applied to their trading in highly speculative markets than as an effective protection against loss.  Not only are trading methods
proprietary, but they often are also continually evolving. Prospective investors and Unitholders will generally not be informed of a change in an Advisor’s trading approach, unless Managing Owner is informed of such change and considers such
change to be material.  In addition to the continually changing character of trading methods, the commodity markets themselves are
continually changing. Each Advisor may, in its sole discretion, elect to trade any available futures or forward contract, option or related instrument — both on United States markets and abroad — even if such Advisor has never previously
traded in that particular contract or market.  Leveraging  Futures trading is highly leveraged, as is each Advisor’s trading program. The average assets as margin with respect to Series J is 16.67%. This
number is historical in nature and represents a composite of the average range of assets as margin used by the Advisors. The number may deviate either below or above the disclosed range. Any change by Managing Owner in the leverage of Series J is
noted in Series J’s monthly reports.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

Monthly rate of return for any month in the Advisors’ performance summaries is, in general, the net performance of the relevant program divided by the beginning of the
month net assets in such program.  Monthly rates of return, in accordance with CFTC regulations and NFA rules, are shown only
for the specific programs to be traded by the Advisors for the Trust. In the accompanying performance descriptions, and with respect to performance information calculated prior to May 1, 2004, certain Advisors adopted a method of computing rate
of return and performance disclosure, referred to as the “Fully-Funded Subset” method, pursuant to an Advisory (the “Fully-Funded Subset Advisory”) published in February 1993 by the CFTC. To qualify for the use of the
Fully-Funded Subset method, the Fully-Funded Subset Advisory required that certain computations be made in order to arrive at the Fully-Funded Subset and that the accounts for which performance was so reported meet two tests which were designed to
provide assurance that the Fully-Funded Subset and the resultant rates of return were representative of the particular trading program.  Effective May 1, 2004, monthly rate of return is calculated by certain Advisors by dividing net performance by the program’s or account’s aggregate nominal account size.  The monthly rates of return for each Advisor, in certain cases, are calculated on the basis of assets under management including proprietary capital.
However, the Advisors believe that the inclusion of such capital has had no material effect on their monthly rates of return.

Compound rate of return is calculated by multiplying on a compound basis each of the monthly rates of return and not by adding or averaging such monthly rates of return. For
periods of less than one year, the results are for the period indicated.

Investment Programs  Each Graham investment program is built around one or more of Graham’s
trend-following trading systems. Graham’s trend systems are designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can occur during periods of price trends in a diverse number of U.S. and international markets. The trend
systems establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by Graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring. The trend systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent
trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the historical trading patterns of the particular market. The trend systems also employ proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that seek to
benefit from sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure.  Global Diversified Program (GDP)  GDP features the first trend system that Graham developed, which began trading client accounts in 1995. It utilizes multiple computerized trading models
and offers broad diversification in both financial and non-financial markets, trading in approximately 65 global markets. GDP’s trend system is primarily long-term in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an
acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action, the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to
years of historical data on each market.  Graham Selective Trading Program (GST)  GST features a Graham trend system developed in 1997, which utilizes an appreciably different trading system than other Graham trend systems. The GST
trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating a high probability that a significant directional move will occur. Although the GST trend system does not trade against the
market trend, this model should be distinguished from a true trend-following strategy inasmuch as it will only participate in specific types of market moves that meet the restrictive criteria of the model, typically requiring a substantial increase
in volatility.  The K4 Program (K4)  The K4 trend system was developed in 1998 and commenced trading operations in January 1999. Like the GST trend system, the K4 trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very
specific characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant directional move will occur. The K4 trend system normally enters or exits a position only when a significant price and volatility spike takes place. It is
designed to have a high percentage of winning trades and it normally maintains a neutral position in approximately 50% of the markets in the portfolio.  The Multi-Trend Program  The Multi-Trend Program provides access through one single investment to all
of the above-mentioned Graham investment programs, including the trend system and other component strategies of each investment program. As of January 1, 2007, the Multi-Trend Program allocates 33.3% of its assets equally to each of GDP, GST
and K4. As market conditions or other circumstances change, Graham may alter the weightings of the individual programs and add (or subtract) other programs to the Multi-Trend Program, as it deems appropriate.  
Trading  Trading Policies  Graham trades actively in both U.S. and foreign markets, primarily in futures contracts, forward contracts, spot contracts and associated derivative instruments such as options and swaps. Graham engages in exchange
for physical (EFP) transactions, which involve the exchange of a futures position for the underlying physical commodity without making

an open, competitive trade on an exchange. Graham also may take long and short positions in equity securities, fixed income securities, hybrid instruments,
options, warrants, customized contractual agreements and other financial instruments as it endeavors to achieve superior results for investors and enhanced portfolio diversification. Graham at times will trade certain instruments as a substitute for
futures or options traded on futures exchanges. Instruments and contracts not traded on any organized exchange may be entered into with banks, brokerage firms or other financial institutions or commodity firms as counterparties. Graham has complete
flexibility in the instruments and markets in which it may invest.  In connection with its programs’ systematic trading, Graham may
employ discretion in determining the leverage and timing of trades for new accounts and the market weighting and participation. In unusual or emergency market conditions, Graham may also utilize discretion in establishing positions or liquidating
positions or otherwise reducing portfolio risk where Graham believes, in its sole discretion, that it is in the potential best interest of its clients to do so. While such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently, no assurance can be given
that Graham’s discretionary actions in these programs will enhance performance.  At standard leverage, and given competitive market
terms by clearing brokers and counterparties for major institutional customers, Graham’s investment programs normally require between 10% and 30% of an account’s equity to meet initial margin requirements, with initial margin requirements
over time expected to average 13% to 20%.  Graham reserves the right in extraordinary market conditions to reduce leverage and portfolio
risk if it feels in its sole discretion that it is in the potential best interest of its clients to do so. While such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently, no assurance can be given that Graham’s actions will enhance performance.
 Markets Traded  Graham
trades actively on a 24-hour basis on most global exchanges as well as the 24-hour interbank market for foreign exchange both in the U.S. and abroad. From time to time, Graham adds to or deletes markets from its trading programs as ongoing research
and future market conditions warrant. Graham may decide to trade certain markets and contracts to the exclusion of others in its trading programs, depending on Graham’s views from time to time. The decision to add or subtract markets from any
investment program shall be at the sole discretion of Graham. Clients will not be informed of these changes as they occur.  Graham uses
both quantitative and qualitative analysis in evaluating its investment programs in terms of both absolute performance and risk-adjusted return. It reviews the Sharpe ratio, Sterling ratio, average drawdown, and many other measures of risk in
determining which trading technique offers the best risk and volatility characteristics. Graham has also developed extremely sophisticated proprietary software to study optimal portfolio weighting strategies, and the effect of specific markets on
the performance, risk, correlation, and volatility characteristics of its investment programs. The actual weighting and leverage used in each market will change over time due to liquidity, price action and risk considerations. Graham also devotes
considerable attention to risk management at the portfolio level to ensure balance between markets and that the overall leverage used by Graham is consistent with Graham’s conservative views on risk.  Performance Record  Investors should
note that the composite performance records include individual accounts that may have materially different rates of return on amounts actually invested, even though they are traded according to the same investment program. This is caused by material
differences among accounts, such as: (1) procedures governing timing for the commencement of trading and means of moving toward full funding of new accounts; (2) the period during which accounts are active; (3) client trading
restrictions; (4) ratio of trading size to level of actual funds deposited with the futures commission merchant, or FCM, (i.e., the extent of notional equity); (5) the degree of leverage employed; (6) the size of the account,
which can influence the size of positions taken and restrict the account from participating in all markets available to an investment program; (7) the amount of interest income earned by an account, which will depend on the rates paid by the
FCM on equity deposits and the amount of equity invested in interest-bearing obligations; (8) the amount of management and incentive fees paid and the amount of brokerage commissions paid; (9) the timing of orders to open or close
positions; (10) market conditions, which influence the quality of trade executions; (11) variations in fill prices; and (12) the timing of additions and withdrawals. Notwithstanding these material differences, each

composite performance record is a valid representation of the accounts included therein.  References to total assets managed by Graham in a particular program or overall, or rate of return on net assets, include any notional equity and may
include client and proprietary funds. Notional equity represents the additional amount of equity that exceeds the amount of equity actually committed to Graham for management. Because notionally funded accounts are more highly leveraged than
fully-funded accounts, they incur magnified gains and losses on their actual investment (which does not include notional equity) compared to fully-funded accounts.  The Rate of Return percentage for each month is obtained by dividing the net income for the month by the net asset value as of the beginning of the month (including contributions made at the start of the month). In
months where asset changes are made mid-month, rates of return are calculated for each segment of the month and compounded. For this purpose, “net income” represents the gross income for the month in question, net of all expenses and
performance allocations. The Rate of Return percentage for each year is determined by calculating the percentage return on an investment made as of the beginning of each year. Specifically, a running index is calculated monthly, compounded by the
rate of return, the annual percentage being the change in this index for the year divided by the year’s initial index.  Graham advises
exempt accounts for qualified eligible clients the performance of which is not included in the composite performance record.  [Remainder of

There have never been any civil, criminal or administrative actions against Eagle or its principals.  
Trading Approach  Systematic Trading Approach  Eagle is offering clients advisory services pursuant to a systematic, model driven, trading approach. The approach is designed to capture and participate
in trading opportunities and structural changes in the markets. The systematic trading approach is designed to identify and participate in intermediate and long term price changes in markets. Systematization of strict trading rules is used to
incorporate money management principles and volatility adjustment features. Decisions to initiate or liquidate positions are dependent upon computer-generated signals which are based on mathematical analysis of closing market prices and the
incorporation of predetermined risk parameters. Volatility adjustment features are designed to trigger profit-taking decisions and to adjust participation in markets which exhibit excessive volatility.  
Trading Programs  Eagle’s systematic trading approach has served as a conceptual framework for the
development of its trading programs. Each system is based on defining the market structures and situations it attempts to capture by formulation of trading rules that will best achieve its goals. These goals are then analyzed with the use of
substantial market data to confirm that the rules can be consistently applied in actual trading. Once the systems are used in actual trading, they are constantly monitored and the trading rules are reevaluated to identify any need for refinements or
modifications. The systems are designed to trade on a fully invested basis in markets exhibiting price behavior which correspond to the market structure and situations they attempt to achieve, while avoiding markets characterized by excessive
volatility or sharp price corrections. Sharp price corrections or high volatility will generally trigger a scale down or even complete liquidation of positions.  Eagle’s trading programs incorporate the trading concepts embedded in its systematic trading approach.  Eagle Momentum Program  The Eagle Momentum Program, or EMP, is a computerized, technical trading system developed, based on
Eagle’s extensive experience in observing and trading the global futures markets, to capture short and intermediate term trading opportunities in markets that exhibit strong price momentum. The current environment for each market is evaluated,
based on its recent trading range, volatility, and overall price behavior. The trading program utilizes trading rules which are based on pattern recognition and money management techniques on both the individual market and portfolio levels.
EMP’s discipline in evaluating market behavior and the attention given to market volatility as well as its risk control tend to screen participation to markets which provide good risk to reward potential. EMP will primarily be involved in
markets that exhibit a rapid move away from the current trading range and exit quickly when the momentum fades. This exit strategy attempts to dynamically adjust exposure before major corrections occur, thus capturing the lion’s share of the
profits.  The adoption of the trading philosophy to a computerized trading system was done by applying rule based techniques to confirm the
trading concept over an extensive body of historical market data and by constantly monitoring and reevaluating the rules in actual trading. The program currently covers 30 commodities, currencies, stock indices and global fixed income markets.
 Set forth is a list of the futures markets that the Eagle Momentum Program currently tracks and in which it may trade. Eagle in its sole
discretion reserves the right to change the markets and exchanges in which it trades. The following parenthetical numbers reflect the approximate sector allocations of the EMP as of February 29, 2008. Due to the short to intermediate nature of
EMP, positions and sector allocations can change considerably from one month to another.

Eagle trades the Eagle Momentum Program on behalf of the Trust. Trading for clients pursuant to the Eagle
Momentum Program commenced in October 2003 and is detailed in Capsule A. Prior to October 2003, Eagle’s proprietary assets were traded under the Eagle Momentum Program. Complete performance results for this program are shown on pages 133
through 134 of Part Two Statement of Additional Information.  Trading pursuant to the Eagle-Global System commenced in August 1995 and is
detailed in Capsule B. Trading pursuant to the Eagle Yield Enhancement program commenced in August 2000 and is detailed in Capsule C. Eagle commenced exclusive management of client’s accounts pursuant to the Eagle System in August 1993 and is
detailed in Capsule D. Trading for clients pursuant to the Eagle Matrix commenced in October 2003 and is detailed in Capsule E. Trading for clients pursuant to the Eagle Risk Allocation Program commenced in June 2004 and is detailed in Capsule F.
Trading of two customized multi-strategy programs commenced in October 2006 and is detailed in Capsules G and H.  Each of the Capsules
represents composite performance for all accounts managed pursuant to a specific Trading Program and therefore, does not reflect (except when the Capsule covers one account) the actual performance of any one of the accounts. Within each Trading
Program all of the accounts were traded pursuant to the same signals generated by the Trading Program. The material differences between and among such accounts and their relative performance are caused by the size of each account, its use of
notional funds, the number of contracts traded by the account, the date each account started trading, the brokerage commission rates charged, and the management and incentive fees paid by the account. The Capsules do not include proprietary or
experimental accounts.  Through March 2004, the rates of return set forth below in Capsules A, B, D and E are based on the fully-funded
subset of Eagle’s accounts managed pursuant to the Trading Program as detailed in CFTC advisory 93-13. This means that (i) Eagle Trading is managing some accounts which are fully-funded and others which are funded at less than 100%, but
only fully-funded accounts are shown; (ii) the value of the Fully-Funded accounts included in the subset constitutes at least 10% of the cash and other margin qualifying assets, or Actual Funds, plus the amount by which the
account’s trading level exceeds the Actual Funds, or Nominal Account Size; and (iii) there are no material differences in the gross trading profit (loss) between the Fully-Funded subset and the Nominal Account Size. Starting April
2004, pursuant to NFA Compliance Rule 2-34, rates of return calculated for all accounts include notional funding.  Capsule C sets forth
actual monthly rate of return of Eagle Yield Enhancement from August 2000 based on Nominal Account size. This information is based on the actual trading of client accounts that were funded at various levels (5%—100%) of Nominal Account
size.  The rates of return shown in Capsule C are those of the Yield Enhancement Program, and include partial interest income, reflecting
actual interest received on the cash in the accounts. For fully-funded accounts, rates of return will be higher than those shown in Capsule C reflecting the interest earned on the full value of such accounts.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

ORTUS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LIMITED  Ortus Capital Management (Cayman) Limited is a company incorporated in the
Cayman Islands on June 27, 2003 with limited liability. It is exempted by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority from the requirement to obtain a license under the Securities Investment Business Law (2003 Revision). It has appointed Ortus
Capital Management Limited as an investment adviser to provide recommendations, investment advice, and implementation assistances to it. Ortus Capital Management Limited is a company incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability and was licensed
by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong on August 29, 2003 to carry on type 9 regulated activity - asset management. Because Ortus trades only foreign exchange contracts, and does not trade futures, neither Ortus Capital
Management (Cayman) Limited nor Ortus Capital Management Limited are registered with the CFTC. If Ortus expects to trade futures, it will comply with CFTC regulations. As used herein, Ortus shall refer to Ortus Capital Management (Cayman) Limited,
Ortus Capital Management Limited or both.  Ortus trades its Major Currency Program for Series J as described below. For past performance of
Ortus, see pages 74 through 75.  
Investment Philosophy  Ortus believes that in order to utilize its capital most effectively, it is important
to take advantage of the opportunities available in multiple financial markets. Although Ortus’ investment activities span across global financial markets (including global and regional currencies, global fixed income and equity markets, and
commodity markets), the investment strategies are based on the same underlying investment philosophy.  The investment philosophy focuses on
the inter-relationship and interplay between any given financial market and its underlying economic fundamentals, that is, the inter-dependence between the financial side and the real side. The real sides of major financial markets are intrinsically
inter-related although they often have their own characteristics. For example the global economy is inter-related through trades of goods and services as well as flows of capital through global financial markets, and each economy has its own
structural characteristics; in the case of an individual stock, the fundamental or the real side includes, among other things, the company’s balance sheet and operating performance, it also includes, among other things, strengths of its
competitors and macro environment in which it operates.  Intuitively, there is a positive association between the financial side and the
real side. For example, a positive shock in a country’s performance is usually associated with an appreciation of the country’s currency; a positive surprise in a company’s performance is usually associated with a rise in the
company’s stock price. However, it is not fruitful and not enough only to understand this positive association between the two sides.  It is far more important to understand and to measure the feedback relationship between the real side and the financial side over various time horizons. At the early stage of an upward trend in an asset price, there is usually an asymmetric
sensitivity of the asset price with respect to the fundamental news. This asymmetric response to news is consistent with an old saying referring to a bull market in stocks: “Good news is good news and no news is good news.” Certainly at
this stage of price dynamics, the feedback from the real side to the financial side is positive and dramatic. Uninformed market participants, having observed the asymmetric price action, can derive certain perceptions about future price dynamics
that affect the demand for the asset, thus creating a tendency for the asset price to trend. A trend may actually occur if there is also a positive feedback from the financial side to the real side. In many cases, such reverse positive feedbacks do
exist, that is, the underlying fundamentals do benefit from firming asset prices. For example, if the US dollar strengthens due to capital flows from the rest of the world, the US economy will usually benefit from such capital flows because capital
inflows to the US lower the cost of capital. Thus, a momentum is set in motion in both the real and the financial side, creating great investment opportunities. At the end of an upward price trend, there is an opposite and asymmetric price
sensitivity with respect to fundamental news. In this case, good news may not be good news and bad news is really bad.  Ortus relies on its
own proprietary models to capture the essence of the positive association and feedback relationship between asset prices and their underlying economic fundamentals over various time horizons, and to evaluate the risk/reward profile of investment
opportunities. The approach is based on innovations and rigorous applications of financial theories and takes into account structural details, inter-relationships, as well as feedback relationships. The same investment philosophy can be applied to

Table of Contents

stock markets, fixed income markets, commodities markets, as well as to currency markets. Depending on the nature of such inter-relationship and interplay
for any given market, the resulting investment horizon can range from a few months to several years. Intuitively, the investment strategies move capital from less “productive” sectors/regions to more “productive” sectors/regions
in the global economy based on Ortus’ proprietary models which identify and evaluate the “productiveness” of capital by taking into account reward as well as risk. Ortus also relies on its own proprietary risk management strategies
that are an integral part of the investment strategies. The risk management strategies aim to maximize upside potential while damping downside shocks. Innovative risk measurement and dynamic strategies to optimally control the portfolio drawdowns
are employed to ensure that the portfolio return distribution is skewed to the right, not left (i.e. the high return side, not the low return side).  The resulting investment style has the following characteristics: (1) systematic, quantitative, and model driven; (2) based on independent, extensive, and continuous research; and (3) disciplined and
quantitative risk management.  
Investment Process and Risk Management  The investment process consists mainly of (1) opportunity
identification and evaluation, or market view formation; (2) risk management (portfolio optimization and optimal drawdown control, and other risk management); and (3) ongoing monitoring, calibration and review.  Market View Formation  Ortus applies
its proprietary models to the global financial markets, and calibrates its models as the markets and economies evolve over time. The data inputs that Ortus uses are available publicly, including economic and monetary data, fiscal and monetary
policies, company and/or industry specific data, and financial market data (such as stock prices, exchange rates, interest rates, implied volatility, implied correlations, etc.). Both current and historic data are employed. Ortus also pays special
attention to special events or situations (such as the internet bubble) that may induce abnormal global capital flows. The market views are expressed in terms of the expected moves, risks associated, and the correlations among markets over various
time horizons. That is, the market views are represented by joint probability distributions of asset returns over various time horizons, which is in sharp contrast to the common approach that is focused on point estimates of asset prices.
 Market views are monitored and reviewed as market conditions change.  Risk Management – Portfolio Optimization  Based on the market views which have taken into account the risks and correlations for various markets under consideration over various time horizons, Ortus constructs its investment portfolio based on its proprietary portfolio optimization
models to optimize the risk/reward profile of Ortus’ capital. The portfolio optimization is part of the risk management strategy and is related to other risk management measures described below.  Risk Management – Optimal Drawdown Control and Determination of Portfolio Size  Market risks are measured by their impact on Net Asset Value, or NAV. The traditional measure such as leverage ratios may not capture the true nature of
exposure to risks. In addition to the risk allocation by portfolio optimization, Ortus aims to optimally control the drawdown of NAV (as measured from the previously achieved NAV peak) to within a comfortable limit. Ortus relies on its own optimal
risk management strategies to dampen downside shocks to NAV. As a result, at any time the total size of the portfolio depends, among other things, on the position of the current NAV relative to its previous high, risk tolerance, the size of capital
(i.e. the current NAV), and market conditions.  Ongoing Monitoring and Review  The investment process is a dynamic and continuous process. Various dimensions of the investment strategy are monitored and reviewed regularly. Portfolio
and model adjustments may be necessary when market conditions change.  
Markets and Instruments  The investment strategies are normally implemented through the most liquid segments
of the global capital markets that include fixed income markets, equity markets, commodity markets, as well as global and regional currency markets. The capital is allocated to any given market according to, among other things, the relative
attractiveness of its risk/reward profile, its relationship with other markets, and the liquidity of the market. Ortus invests

in, holds, sells (including through short sales), trades and otherwise deals in securities, futures, and over-the-counter financial products in global
financial markets for investment as well as for risk management purposes. Although Ortus may employ a wide range of financial instruments such as securities, futures, options, warrants, fixed income products and variable income products, bank
deposits, forwards, swaps, and other over-the-counter derivative products, it primarily uses simple plain-vanilla instruments with substantial liquidity such as listed futures contracts and short-term currency forward contracts. Ortus will seek to
use the most efficient instruments to implement any particular strategy.  Currently, the markets involved and instruments used are currency
spot transactions and currency forward and swap transactions (with tenors not longer than 12 months) among major currencies. In addition, Ortus may invest a small portion of its capital in other public or private investment funds or managed accounts
if strategic and economic reasons exist to do so.

USE OF PROCEEDS  The proceeds of the offering of the Units are used by Series J to engage in the speculative
trading on futures, forward, options and related markets through allocating such proceeds to the applicable Advisor.  To the extent Series
J trades in futures contracts on U.S. exchanges, the assets deposited by Series J with its Clearing Brokers as margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of
instruments — principally U.S. government obligations.  To the extent that Series J trades in futures, forward, options and related
contracts on markets other than regulated U.S. futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin positions held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments of a credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC
for investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in “customer segregated fund accounts.”  As of the date of this Prospectus, the Trust places 100% of the Net Asset Value of Series J in segregated accounts in the name of the Trust on behalf of
Series J with the Clearing Broker or another eligible financial institution in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills to margin positions of all commodities combined. Such funds are segregated pursuant to CFTC rules.  The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator, will be responsible for the cash management activities of the Trust, including investing in
U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agencies issues.  In addition, assets of Series J not required to margin positions may be maintained in
United States bank accounts opened in the name of the Trust on behalf of Series J and may be held in U.S. Treasury bills (or other securities approved by the CFTC for investment of customer funds).  Series J receives 100% of the interest income earned on its assets.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

1.
The foregoing breakeven analysis assumes that the Units have a constant month-end Net Asset Value. Calculations are based on $5,000 as the Net Asset Value per Unit. See
“Charges” beginning on page 78 for an explanation of the expenses included in the “Breakeven Table.” 


2.
Class II Units may be offered and sold only to investors who are represented by approved Correspondent Selling Agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services
rendered in connection with an investment in the Trust (such arrangements commonly referred to as “wrap-accounts”). Class II Unitholders are not charged any Service Fee. 


3.
Based on assumptions herein, the Advisor’s Incentive Fee is 0.90% for Class I and 0.50% for Class II. 


 4.
 Investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class I Units of Series J before the first anniversary of the purchase of
such Units will be subject to a redemption charge (which amount is reflected in this Service Fee item) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Net Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by
(ii) the number of months remaining before the first anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by (iii) 1/12th of
2.00%. 


 5.
 Each Unit purchased pays to Kenmar Securities Inc. in arrears a monthly Sales Commission equal to 1/12th of 1.00% (1.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value of the outstanding Units as of the beginning of the month. 


6.
Administrative expenses are currently estimated to be 0.75%. Actual expenses may be higher or lower. The Managing Owner expects that as the Net Asset Value of Series J increases,
the administrative expenses of Series J will decline as a percentage of Series J’s Net Asset Value. 


7.
Expense levels are assumed to be at maximum amount. Actual expenses may be lower. 


8.
Although the actual rates of brokerage commissions and transaction related fees and expenses are the same for all Advisors, the total amount of brokerage commissions and trading
fees varies from Advisor to Advisor based upon the trading frequency of the Advisors and the specific futures contracts traded. The estimates presented in the table above are prepared using historical data about the Advisors’ trading
activities. 


9.
Interest income is currently estimated to be earned at a rate of 1.15%, although such interest income is variable based on short-term interest rates. 


10.
For purposes of this breakeven analysis, we have assumed (i) that the Advisors will have identical performance and identical incentive fees, (ii) that the Advisors will
generate a weighted average rate of brokerage commissions and other expenses equal to 0.23%, and (iii) a weighted average Advisor’s base fee of 2.17%. In actuality, the Advisors’ performance and incentive fees will be divergent among
the Advisors, the Advisors will generate a weighted average rate of brokerage commissions and other expenses which could be higher or lower than 0.23% and, because Advisors’ base fees are assessed monthly while Series J will rebalance
quarterly, weighted average Advisors’ base fees could be higher or lower than 2.17%.

Table of Contents

CHARGES  
Management Fee  Series J pays to the Managing Owner in
arrears a monthly management fee equal to 1/12th of 0.50% (0.50% per annum) of the Net Asset Value (defined below) of Series J as of the beginning
of the month.  “Net Asset Value” is the total assets in Series J less total liabilities of Series J, each determined on the basis
of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, consistently applied under the accrual method of accounting.  
Advisors’ Fees  Series J pays to Graham in
arrears a monthly base fee equal to 1/12th of 2.50% (2.50% per annum) on the portion of the assets of Series J under the management of Graham as of
the end of the month. Series J pays to each of Eagle and Ortus in arrears a monthly base fee equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) on the
portion of the assets of Series J under the management of such Advisors as of the end of the month. The aggregate Advisors’ base fees paid by Series J are expected roughly to approximate the weighted average of the Advisors’ base fees or
2.17%.  Series J pays an incentive fee of 20% of New High Net Trading Profits (defined below), including realized and unrealized gains and
losses, as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar quarter. Series J will pay such incentive fee separately with respect to each of its Advisors based on New High Net Trading Profits generated by such Advisor, regardless of the
profitability of Series J as a whole. The incentive fees will be paid quarterly in arrears.  Below is a sample calculation of how the
performance fee is determined:  Assume that Series J paid an incentive fee to an Advisor at the end of the second quarter of 2007 and assume
that such Advisor achieved “New High Net Trading Profits (as defined in the next paragraph) of $200,000 during the third quarter of 2007. The New High Net Trading Profits would be $200,000 and the Advisor’s incentive fee payable by your
Series would be $40,000 (0.2 x $200,000). Now assume Series J paid an incentive fee to an Advisor at the end of the third quarter of 2007 but did not pay an incentive fee to such Advisor at the end of the second quarter of 2007 because such Advisor
had trading losses for Series J of $100,000. If such Advisor achieved trading profits for Series J of $200,000 at the end of the third quarter of 2007, such Advisor’s New High Net Trading Profits for the quarter would be $100,000 ($200,000 -
$100,000 loss carryforward) and the Advisor’s incentive fee would be $20,000 (0.2 x $100,000). Please note that this simplified example assumes that no investors have added or redeemed Units during this sample time frame. Such capital changes
require that the calculation be determined on a “per unit” basis.  “New High Net Trading Profits” (for purposes of
calculating an Advisor’s incentive fees) will be computed as the close of business of the last day of each calendar quarter, or the Incentive Measurement Date, and will include such profits (as outlined below) since the immediately preceding
Incentive Measurement Date (or, with respect to the first Incentive Measurement Date, since commencement of operations of Series J or the date the Advisor commenced trading activities for Series J), or each an Incentive Measurement Period. New High
Net Trading Profits for any Incentive Measurement Period will be the net profits, if any, from the Advisor’s trading during such period (including (i) realized trading profit (loss) plus or minus (ii) the change in unrealized trading
profit (loss) on open positions), and will be calculated after the determination of certain transaction costs attributable to the Advisor’s trading activities and the Advisor’s management fee, but before deduction of any incentive fees
payable during the Incentive Measurement Period. New High Net Trading Profits will not include interest earned or credited on the assets allocated to the Advisor. New High Net Trading Profits will be generated only to the extent that the cumulative
New High Net Trading Profits achieved by the Advisor exceed the highest level of cumulative New High Net Trading Profits achieved by such Advisor as of a previous Incentive Measurement Date. Except as set forth below, net losses from prior quarters
must be recouped before New High Net Trading Profits can again be generated. If a withdrawal or distribution occurs or if the Advisory Agreement is terminated at any date that is not an Incentive Measurement Date, the date of the withdrawal or
distribution or termination will be treated as if it were an Incentive Measurement Date, but any incentive fee accrued in respect of the withdrawn assets on such date shall not be paid to the Advisor until the next scheduled Incentive Measurement
Date. New High Net Trading Profits for an Incentive Measurement Period shall exclude capital contributions allocated to the Advisor in an Incentive Measurement Period, distributions or 
  
-78- 


Table of Contents

redemptions paid or payable from the Advisor’s account during an Incentive Measurement Period, as well as losses, if any, associated with redemptions,
distributions, and reallocations of assets during the Incentive Measurement Period and prior to the Incentive Measurement Date (and any loss carryforward attributable to the Advisor will be reduced in the same proportion that the value of the assets
allocated away from the Advisor comprises of the value of the assets allocated to the Advisor prior to such allocation away from the Advisor). In calculating New High Net Trading Profits, incentive fees paid for a previous Incentive Measurement
Period will not reduce cumulative New High Net Trading Profits in subsequent periods.  
Sales Commission  Series J pays to the Selling Agent
in arrears a monthly Sales Commission equal to 1/12th of 1.00% (1.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value of the outstanding Units as of the beginning
of each month. This sales commission is in addition to the Service Fee charged in respect of Class I Units.  
Brokerage Commissions and Fees  Series J pays to the Clearing Broker all brokerage commissions, including
applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with Series J’s trading activities. On average, total charges paid to the Clearing Broker are expected to
be less than $10.00 per round-turn trade, although the Clearing Broker’s brokerage commissions and trading fees will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis. The exact amount of such brokerage commissions and trading fees to be incurred
is impossible to estimate and will vary based upon a number of factors including the trading frequency of each Advisor, the types of instruments traded, transaction sizes, degree of leverage employed and transaction rates in effect from time to
time. Based upon the Advisors’ historical trading activities, the Managing Owner does not expect brokerage commissions and fees to exceed 1.50% of the Net Asset Value of Series J in any year.  
Extraordinary Fees and Expenses  Series J pays all its extraordinary fees and expenses, if any, and its
allocable portion of all extraordinary fees and expenses of the Trust generally, if any, as determined by the Managing Owner. Extraordinary fees and expenses are fees and expenses that are non-recurring and unusual in nature, such as legal claims
and liabilities and litigation costs and any permitted indemnification payments related thereto. Extraordinary fees and expenses shall also include material expenses that are not currently anticipated obligations of the Trust or of managed futures
funds in general, such as the payment of partnership taxes or governmental fees associated with payment of such taxes. Routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses will not be deemed extraordinary expenses. Any fees and expenses
imposed on the Trust due to the status of an individual shall be paid by such individual or Series J, not the Managing Owner.  
Routine Operational, Administrative and Other Ordinary Expenses  Series J pays all of its routine
operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses and its allocable share of all routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses of the Trust generally, as determined by the Managing Owner including, but not limited to,
accounting and computer services, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and accounting fees and expenses, tax preparation expenses, filing fees, printing, mailing and duplication costs. Such routine expenses are currently estimated to be
0.50%. Actual expenses may be higher or lower. The Managing Owner expects that as the Net Asset Value of Series J increases, the routine expenses of Series J will decline as a percentage of its Net Asset Value.  
Organization and Offering Expenses  Expenses incurred in connection with organizing of the Trust and the
initial offering of Units were $1,454,441, of which $1,384,181 was allocated to Series J. Such organizational and initial offering expenses were paid by the Managing Owner, subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in 36 monthly
payments during each of the first 36 months of the Trust’s operations; provided, however, that in no event shall the Managing Owner be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses in an aggregate amount in excess of 2.5% of the aggregate
amount of all subscriptions accepted by the Trust during the initial offering period and the first 36 months of the Trust’s operations. If a Series terminates prior to completion of the foregoing reimbursement, or the full amount of such
expenses has not been fully reimbursed by the end of such 36 month period, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to receive any further reimbursement in respect of such expenses and such Series will have no 
  
-79- 


Table of Contents

further obligation to make reimbursement payments in respect of such expenses from such Series. As of February 29, 2008, Series J has reimbursed the
Managing Owner $735,896 for organization and initial offering expenses.  The Managing Owner also will be responsible for the payment of all
offering expenses of each Series incurred during the offering; provided, however, that the amount of such offering expenses paid by the Managing Owner shall be subject to reimbursement by such Series, without interest, in up to 36 monthly
payments during each of the first 36 months following the month in which such expenses were paid by the Managing Owner. If such Series terminates prior to the completion of any such reimbursement, or the full amount of such expenses has not been
fully reimbursed by the end of such 36 month period, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to receive, and such Series will not be required to pay, any unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of the date of such termination. Through
February 29, 2008, expenses incurred in connection with ongoing offering of Units are $1,142,522, of which $1,085,360 has been allocated to Series J. Ongoing offering costs incurred through November 30, 2006 in the amount of $599,062 will
not be reimbursed to the Managing Owner. Through February 29, 2008, no reimbursement has been paid to the Managing Owner for ongoing offering costs incurred for the period December 1, 2006 through February 29, 2008 in the amount of
$486,298.  In no event will the aggregate amount of payments by Series J in any month in respect of reimbursement of organizational and
offering expenses (whether incurred prior to or during the offering) exceed 0.50% per annum of the Net Asset Value of Series J as of the beginning of such month.  Organization and offering expenses means those expenses incurred in connection with the formation, qualification and registration of the Trust and the Units and in offering, distributing and processing the Units under
applicable Federal and state law, and any other expenses actually incurred and, directly or indirectly, related to the organization of the Trust or the initial and continuous offering of the Units, including, but not limited to, expenses such as:
  


 
•
 
 initial and ongoing registration fees, filing fees, escrow fees and taxes   


 
•
 
 costs of preparing, printing (including typesetting), amending, supplementing, mailing and distributing the Registration Statement, the exhibits thereto and the
Prospectus during the initial offering period and the offering   


 
•
 
 the costs of qualifying, printing, (including typesetting), amending, supplementing, mailing and distributing sales materials used in connection with the offering
and issuance of the Units during the initial offering period and the offering   


 
•
 
 travel, telegraph, telephone and other expenses in connection with the offering and issuance of the Units during the initial offering period and the offering
  


 
•
 
 accounting, auditing and legal fees (including disbursements related thereto) incurred in connection therewith and   


 
•
 
 any extraordinary expenses (including, but not limited to, legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs and any permitted indemnification associated therewith)
related thereto.  Organizational and offering expenses have been and will be allocated among the Series as determined by
the Managing Owner to be fair and equitable, provided that any such expenses attributable to a single Series have been and shall be borne by such Series alone.  The Managing Owner will not allocate to the Trust or a Series of the Trust, the indirect expenses of the Managing Owner.  
Service Fees – General  The Selling Agent and the Managing Owner have selected the Correspondent Selling
Agents to assist in the making of offers and sales of Units and to provide customary ongoing services to the Trust and its Unitholders for commodities related brokerage services. Such ongoing services may include, without limitation:   


 
•
 
 advising Unitholders of the Net Asset Value of the Trust, of Series J and of their Units in Series J;   


 
•
 
 responding to Unitholders’ inquiries about monthly statements and annual reports and tax information provided to them;   


 
•
 
 advising Unitholders whether to make additional capital contributions to the Trust or to redeem their Units;   


 
•
 
 assisting with redemptions of Units;   


 
•
 
 providing information to Unitholders with respect to futures and forward market conditions; and   


 
•
 
 providing further services that may be requested by Unitholders.   

-80- 


Table of Contents
Any Correspondent Selling Agent that will receive any ongoing service fees with respect to Units sold by
it must be duly registered with the NFA as a futures commission merchant or introducing broker. Any associated person of such a Correspondent Selling Agent must be registered with the NFA as an associated person having taken the Series 3 and/or
Series 31 Commodity Brokerage Exam or having been “grandfathered” as an associated person qualified to do commodities brokerage.  
Class I – Service Fee  Series J pays to the
Selling Agent a Service Fee in respect of the Class I Units of Series J, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) of the Net
Asset Value per Unit of the outstanding Class I Units at the beginning of the month for services provided to the Trust and its Unitholders. The Service Fee is compensation which remains payable with respect to the Class I Units for as long as such
Units are outstanding. Payment of the Service Fee is subject to rules, regulations and interpretations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (formerly the National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, Inc.).  The Correspondent Selling Agents are entitled to receive from the Selling Agent in respect of
Class I Units sold by them an initial service fee for commodities brokerage related services in an amount equal to two percent (2.00%) of the initial Net Asset Value of each Class I Unit sold by the Correspondent Selling Agents, payable on the
date such Units are purchased and, commencing with the thirteenth month after the purchase date of a Class I Unit, an ongoing monthly service fee equal to 1/12th of 2.00% (2.00% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Unit at the beginning of the month of each Class I Unit sold by the Correspondent Selling Agents. In exchange for paying the Correspondent Selling Agents the
initial service fee in advance, the Selling Agent will retain the Service Fee paid by the Trust in respect of each Class I Unit during the first twelve months after the date of purchase. Thereafter, the entire amount of the Selling Fee will be paid
over to the Correspondent Selling Agent by the Selling Agent.  The aggregate amount to be paid by the Trust to the Selling Agent under the
foregoing arrangement may be more or less than the amount paid to the Correspondent Selling Agent by the Selling Agent in respect of the same Class I Unit. If the aggregate amount paid to the Selling Agent by the Trust during such twelve month
period in respect of a Class I Unit exceeds the amount paid to the Correspondent Selling Agent by the Selling Agent on the original purchase date of such Class I Unit, the Selling Agent will not be required to repay any such excess to the Trust. If
the amount paid to a Correspondent Selling Agent by the Selling Agent on the original purchase date of a Class I Unit exceeds the aggregate amount paid to the Selling Agent by the Trust during such twelve month period in respect of such Class I
Unit, the Trust will not be required to pay any such excess to the Selling Agent.  
Class II  Class II Units may only be offered to investors who are represented by approved Correspondent
Selling Agents who are directly compensated by the investor for services rendered in connection with an investment in the Trust (such arrangements commonly referred to as “wrap-accounts”).  Investors who purchase Class II Units will not be charged any Service Fee in respect of such Class II Units.  
Redemption Charge  There is no redemption charge in respect of Class II Units.  A Class I Unitholder who redeems a Class I Unit prior to the first anniversary of the purchase of
such Unit will be subject to a redemption charge in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Net Asset Value per Unit on the redemption date of the Units being redeemed, multiplied by (ii) the number of months remaining before the first
anniversary of the date such Units were purchased, multiplied by (iii) 1/12th of 2.00%. There is no redemption charge for Class I Units on or
after the first anniversary of their purchase.  Redemption charges do not reduce Net Asset Value or New High Net Trading Profit for any
purpose, only the amount that Unitholders receive upon redemption.  In the event that an investor acquires Units at more than one closing
date, the redemption charge will be calculated on a “first-in, first-out” basis for redemption purposes (including determining the amount of any applicable redemption charge).   
-81-

The redemption charge is paid by the redeeming Unitholder to the Selling Agent.  The Managing Owner believes that the fee structure of the Trust described above complies with sections IV.C.1, IV.C.2 and IV.C.3c of the NASAA
Guidelines.  
WHO MAY SUBSCRIBE  The Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents selling Units in the Trust are
obligated to make every reasonable effort to determine that the purchase of Units is a suitable and appropriate investment for each subscriber, based on information provided by the subscriber regarding his or its financial situation and investment
objective.  A PURCHASE OF THE UNITS SHOULD BE MADE ONLY BY THOSE PERSONS WHOSE FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL PERMIT THEM TO BEAR THE RISK OF A
TOTAL LOSS OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE TRUST. AN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT.  Investors
should not purchase Units with the expectation of tax benefits in the form of losses or deductions. If losses accrue to a Series, your distributive share of such losses will, in all probability, be treated as a capital loss and generally will be
available only for offsetting capital gains from other sources. To the extent that you have no capital gains, capital losses can be used only to a very limited extent as a deduction from ordinary income.      The Managing Owner sends each Unitholder a monthly statement that includes a description of performance of Series J during the prior month and sets
forth, among other things, the brokerage commissions, the Advisors’ base fee and Incentive Fee in respect of Series J during such month and on a year-to-date basis.  
THE CLEARING BROKER  AND FUTURES BROKER  Series J’s clearing broker is UBS Securities. UBS Securities also acts as the Series’ futures broker. UBS Securities has not been involved in
the organization of the Trust and does not take any part in the Trust’s ongoing management. UBS Securities is not affiliated with the Managing Owner, nor is UBS Securities responsible for the activities of the Managing Owner. UBS Securities
principal business address is 677 Washington Blvd, Stamford, CT 06901. UBS Securities is registered in the U.S. with the NASD as a broker-dealer and with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant. UBS Securities is a member of various U.S. futures
securities exchanges. UBS Securities was involved in the 2003 Global Research Analyst Settlement. This settlement is part of the global settlement that UBS Securities and nine other firms have reached with the SEC, NASD, NYSE and various state
regulators. As part of the settlement, UBS Securities has agreed to pay $80,000,000 divided among retrospective relief, for procurement of independent research and for investor education. UBS Securities has also undertaken to adopt enhanced policies
and procedures reasonably designed to address potential conflicts of interest arising from research practices. UBS Securities will act only as a clearing broker for both Series and as such will be paid commissions for executing and clearing trades
on behalf of both Series. UBS Securities has not passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this Prospectus. UBS Securities neither will act in any supervisory capacity with respect to the Managing Owner nor participate in the management of the
Managing Owner, the Trust or Series J.      Additional or replacement
clearing brokers or futures brokers may be appointed in respect of the account of Series J in the future.  
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  
General  The Managing Owner has not established any formal procedure to resolve conflicts of interest.
Consequently, investors will be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Managing Owner attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
for the Managing Owner to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to Series J.  Prospective
investors should be aware that the Managing Owner presently intends to assert that Unitholders have, by subscribing to Series J, consented to the following conflicts of interest in the event of any proceeding alleging that such conflicts violated
any duty owed by the Managing Owner to investors.

Table of Contents

The Managing Owner  Other Investment Products Sponsored by the Managing Owner and its Affiliates
 The Managing Owner and its affiliates sponsor and operate other commodity pools and alternative investment products. The Managing Owner
and its principals and affiliates have investments in certain of such products. The Managing Owner has a conflict of interest in allocating its own resources among different clients. The Managing Owner cannot and will not devote all of its time or
resources to the management of the business and affairs of the Trust but intends to devote sufficient time and resources properly to manage the business and affairs of the Trust consistent with its fiduciary duties to the Trust and the Managing
Owner’s other clients.  Registrations of Certain Principals of the Managing Owner with Affiliates  Certain principals of the Managing Owner are registered with affiliates of the Managing Owner. Such principals have a conflict of interest in allocating
their time among the Managing Owner and its affiliates, and each of the Managing Owner’s and such affiliates’ clients. Such principals cannot and will not devote all of their time or resources to the management of the business and affairs
of the Trust but intend to devote sufficient time and resources properly to manage the business and affairs of the Trust consistent with their duties to the Trust and the other clients of the Managing Owner and its affiliates.  
The Advisors  Other Clients and Business Activities of the Advisors  The Advisors and their principals each devote their business time to ventures in addition to managing the assets of Series J.  The Advisors may have a conflict of interest in rendering advice to Series J because of other accounts managed or traded by them or their affiliates,
including accounts owned by their principals, which may be traded differently from the account of Series J. The Advisors may have financial incentives to favor certain accounts over Series J.  Brokers and Dealers Selected by Advisors  Certain of the Advisors may require, as a condition of their retention, that the account of Series J which they trade must trade through specific executing brokers with which such Advisors have ongoing business dealings. Such Advisors may
have a conflict of interest between insisting on the use of such brokers and using the brokers most advantageous for Series J.  Certain of
the Advisors may execute a number of the trades for the account of Series J which they trade through affiliated floor brokers or foreign exchange dealers, which will be compensated for their trading services.  
The Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and Executing Brokers  Any clearing broker, including the Clearing
Broker, any futures broker, including the Futures Broker, and any executing broker selected by an Advisor may act from time to time as a commodity broker for other accounts with which it is affiliated or in which it or one of its affiliates has a
financial interest. The compensation received by the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers from such accounts may be more or less than the compensation received for brokerage and forward trading services provided to Series J. In
addition, various accounts traded through the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers (and over which their personnel may have discretionary trading authority) may take positions in the futures markets opposite to those of Series J
or may compete with Series J for the same positions. The Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers may have a conflict of interest in their execution of trades for Series J and for other customers. The Managing Owner will, however,
not retain any clearing broker or futures broker for Series J which the Managing Owner has reason to believe would knowingly or deliberately favor any other customer over Series J with respect to the execution of commodity trades.  The Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers will benefit from executing orders for other clients, whereas Series J may be harmed to the
extent that the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers have fewer resources to allocate to Series J’s accounts due to the existence of such other clients.  Certain officers or employees of the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and executing brokers 
  
-83- 


Table of Contents

may be members of United States commodities exchanges and/or serve on the governing bodies and standing committees of such exchanges, their clearinghouses
and/or various other industry organizations. In such capacities, these officers or employees may have a fiduciary duty to the exchanges, their clearinghouses and/or such various other industry organizations that could compel such employees to act in
the best interests of these entities, perhaps to the detriment of Series J.  
Selling Agents  The Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents to be selected for Series J will
receive the service fee in respect of Class I Units sold by them. The individual registered representatives of the Selling Agents and the Correspondent Selling Agents will themselves receive a significant portion of the compensation paid to the
Selling Agents. Consequently, they will have a conflict of interest both in recommending the purchase of Units by their clients and in counseling clients as to whether to redeem.  
Proprietary Trading/Other Clients  The Managing Owner, the Advisors, the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker
and their respective principals and affiliates may trade in the commodity markets for their own accounts and for the accounts of their clients, and in doing so may take positions opposite to those held by Series J or may compete with Series J for
positions in the marketplace. Such trading may create conflicts of interest on behalf of one or more such persons in respect of their obligations to Series J. Records of proprietary trading and trading on behalf of other clients will not be
available for inspection by Unitholders.  Because the Managing Owner, the Advisors, the Clearing Broker, the Futures Broker and their
respective principals and affiliates may trade for their own accounts at the same time that they are managing the accounts of Series J, prospective investors should be aware that, as a result of a neutral allocation system, testing a new trading
system, trading their proprietary accounts more aggressively or other activities not constituting a breach of fiduciary duty, such persons may from time to time take positions in their proprietary accounts which are opposite, or ahead of, the
positions taken for Series J.  
Ancillary Business Arrangements Between the Managing Owner and Certain Advisors  The Managing Owner and some
of the Advisors may have business arrangements between them that do not directly relate to the Trust’s business. For example, the Managing Owner or its affiliates may sponsor other investment funds that employ one or more of the Advisors. In
addition, an affiliate of the Managing Owner may act as the selling agent for an investment fund operated by one or more of the Advisors. These business arrangements may present a disincentive for the Managing Owner to terminate such Advisors even
though termination may be in the best interest of Series J for which they trade.  
No Distributions  The Managing Owner has discretionary authority over all distributions made by the Trust. In
view of the Trust’s objective of seeking significant capital appreciation, the Managing Owner currently does not intend to make any distributions. Greater management fees will be generated to the benefit of the Managing Owner and the Advisors
if the Trust’s assets are not reduced by distributions to the Unitholders.  
Receipt of Soft Dollars  Certain of the Advisors may receive services or products provided by a commodity
broker, a practice known as receiving “soft dollars.” Such services of products may be used to provide appropriate assistance to such Advisors in making investment decisions for its clients, which may include research reports or analysis
about particular commodities, publications, database software and services, quotation equipment and other products or services that may enhance such Advisors’ investment decision making. As a result, such Advisor has a conflict of interest
because it receives valuable benefits from a commodity broker, and the transaction compensation charged by the broker might not be the lowest available.  Neither the Managing Owner nor any of its principals receive any “soft dollar” compensation.  
Incentive Fees  The Incentive Fee arrangement between Series J and its Advisors may create an incentive for
the Advisors to make trading decisions that are more speculative or subject to a greater risk of loss than would be the case if no such arrangement existed.

Unified Counsel  In connection with this offering, the Trust and the Managing Owner have been represented by
unified counsel. To the extent that this offering could benefit by further independent review, such benefit will not be available in this offering.  
UBS Securities LLC  Kenmar Holdings Inc., the parent company of the Managing Owner and the Selling Agent, has
entered into a loan agreement with UBS Loan Finance, LLC, an affiliate of UBS Securities, whereby UBS Loan Finance may make loans to KHI, among other things, to facilitate the Selling Agent’s payment of the initial service fee with respect to
the Class I Units. UBS Loan Finance may make or deny a loan in its sole discretion. In the event of a default by KHI, UBS Loan Finance may call any or all outstanding loans. Moreover, UBS Loan Finance may terminate the loan agreement or call any or
all outstanding loans at any time in its sole discretion.  While the existence of this credit facility could be thought to have influenced
the selection or continued retention of UBS Securities to serve as the clearing and futures broker on behalf of the Series, the provision of the credit facility was not a material inducement regarding selection or continued retention of UBS
Securities to serve as the clearing and futures broker of the Series.  
REDEMPTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  Series J is intended as a long-term “buy and hold” investment.
The objective of Series J is to achieve significant profits over time while controlling the risk of loss. However, there can be no assurance that Series J will meet its objectives, and Unitholders may exacerbate their losses by “buying and
holding” an investment in the Units of Series J in the event that Series J sustains a prolonged period of losses.  A Unitholder
may redeem any or all of his or her Units as of the close of business on the last Business Day of any calendar month — beginning with the end of the first month following such Unitholder’s purchase of such Units — at Net Asset Value,
provided that the Request for Redemption is received by the Managing Owner by 10:00 AM New York time at 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye Brook, New York 10573, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the end of such month excluding the last
Business Day of the month. For example, if the last Business Day of the month is a Friday, notice must be received by the Managing Owner by 10:00 AM New York time on the Friday of the immediately preceding week. Redemption requests received before
the foregoing deadline may be withdrawn before the foregoing deadlines. The Managing Owner may, in its sole discretion and for good cause, waive notice deadlines for redemptions. Your minimum redemption request may be the lesser of either $1,000 or
ten (10) Units; provided that, if you are redeeming less than all your Units, your remaining Units must have an aggregate Net Asset Value of at least $5,000. If you only redeem some of your Units, and as a result, your account balances fall
below the minimum investment amount (i.e., $5,000) you may be compulsorily redeemed at the Managing Owner’s sole discretion. The Net Assets of Series J are its assets less its liabilities determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Net Asset Value per Unit of Series J is equal to the Net Assets of Series J divided by the number of Units of Series J outstanding as of the date of determination.  In the event that an investor acquires Units at more than one time, his or her Units are treated on a “first-in, first-out” basis for purposes
of determining whether (or what) redemption charges apply.  To redeem Units, Unitholders may contact their respective Correspondent Selling
Agent (in writing if required by such Correspondent Selling Agent). Correspondent Selling Agents must notify the Managing Owner in writing in order to effectuate redemptions of the Units. A signature guarantee may be required by your Correspondent
Selling Agent or the Managing Owner. However, a Unitholder who no longer has a Correspondent Selling Agent account must request redemption in writing (signature guaranteed unless waived by the Managing Owner) by corresponding with the Managing
Owner.  The Managing Owner may declare additional redemption dates, including Special Redemption Dates that involve a suspension of
trading, upon notice to the Unitholders.  Redemption proceeds generally will be paid out within fifteen (15) Business Days of
redemption. However, in special circumstances, including, but not limited to, default or delay in payments due to Series J from banks or other persons, Series J may in turn delay payment to persons requesting redemption of Units of the proportionate
part of the redemption value of their Units equal to the proportionate part of the Net Assets of Series J represented by the sums that are the subject of such default or delay. No such 
  
-85- 


Table of Contents

delays have been imposed to date by any fund sponsored by the Managing Owner or its affiliates.  The Net Asset Value per Unit as of the date of redemption may differ substantially from the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the date by which irrevocable
notice of redemption must be submitted.  The Managing Owner has not made, and has no intention of making, any distribution from the profits
or capital of Series J to its Unitholders.  Unitholders do not need to redeem all their Units in order to redeem some of their Units.
 
THE TRUST, THE SERIES, THE TRUSTEE  AND THE MANAGING OWNER; CERTAIN  MATERIAL TERMS OF THE TRUST  DECLARATION  The following summary describes in brief certain aspects of the operation of the Trust and the Series, the
Trustee’s and the Managing Owner’s respective responsibilities concerning the Trust and the Series and the material terms of the Declaration of Trust. Prospective investors should carefully review the Declaration of Trust attached hereto
as Exhibit A and consult with their own advisers concerning the implications to such prospective subscribers of investing in a Series of a Delaware Statutory Trust. Capitalized terms used in this section and not otherwise defined shall have such
meanings assigned to them under the Declaration of Trust.  
Principal Office; Location of Records  The Trust is organized in a series as a statutory trust under the
Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The Trust is administered by the Managing Owner, whose office is located 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye Brook, New York 10573, telephone: (914) 307-7000. The records of the Trust, including a list of the
Unitholders of each Series and their addresses, are located at the foregoing address, and available for inspection and copying (upon payment of reasonable reproduction costs) by Unitholders of such Series or their representatives for any purposes
reasonably related to a Unitholder’s interest as a beneficial owner of such Series during regular business hours as provided in the Declaration of Trust. The Managing Owner will maintain and preserve the books and records of the Trust for a
period of not less than six years. Pursuant to the Fund’s agreement with Spectrum, Spectrum is required to prepare and maintain many of the books and records that the Managing Owner would otherwise be required to prepare and maintain. Spectrum
will maintain and preserve the books and records of the Trust for a period of not less than six years.  The Trust is formed and will be
operated in a manner such that each Series will be liable only for obligations attributable to such Series and Unitholders of a Series will not be subject to the losses or liabilities of the other Series. If any creditor or Unitholder in a Series
asserted against the Trust a valid claim with respect to its indebtedness or Units, the creditor or Unitholder would only be able to recover money from that particular Series and its assets and from the Managing Owner and its assets. Accordingly,
the debts, liabilities, obligations, claims and expenses, or collectively, Claims, incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing solely with respect to a particular Series will be enforceable only against the assets of that Series and against the
Managing Owner and its assets, and not against the other Series or the Trust generally or any of their respective assets. The assets of a particular Series include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the
Trust on account of and for the benefit of that Series, including, without limitation, funds delivered to the Trust for the purchase of Units in a Series. This limitation on liability is referred to as the “Inter-Series Limitation on
Liability.” The Inter-Series Limitation on Liability is expressly provided for under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which provides that if certain conditions (as set forth in Section 3804(a)) are met, then the debts of a particular
Series will be enforceable only against the assets of such Series and not against the assets of the other Series or the Trust generally.  In furtherance of the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability, every party, including the Unitholders, the Trustee and all parties providing goods or services to the Trust, a Series or the Managing Owner on behalf of the Trust or a Series,
will acknowledge and consent in writing to:   


 
•
 
 the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability with respect to such party’s Claims or Units;   


 
•
 
 voluntarily reduce the priority of its Claims against and Units in the Trust or a Series or their respective assets, such that its Claims and Units are junior in
right of repayment to all other parties’ Claims against and Units in the Trust or a Series or their respective assets, except that (a) Units in the particular Series that such party purchased pursuant to a Subscription Agreement or similar

  
-86-

agreement and (b) Claims against the Trust where recourse for the payment of such Claims was, by agreement, limited to the assets of a particular
Series, will not be junior in right of repayment, but will receive repayment from the assets of such particular Series (but not from the assets of the other Series or the Trust generally) equal to the treatment received by all other creditors and
Unitholders that dealt with such Series; and   


 
•
 
 a waiver of certain rights that such party may have under the United States Bankruptcy Code, if such party held collateral for its Claims, in the event that the
Trust is a debtor in a chapter 11 case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, to have any deficiency Claim (i.e., the difference, if any, between the amount of the Claim and the value of the collateral) treated as an unsecured Claim against
the Trust generally or the other Series.  
Certain Aspects of the Trust and the Series  Each Series of the Trust is the functional equivalent of a
limited partnership; prospective investors should not anticipate any legal or practical protections under Delaware Statutory Trust Act greater than those available to limited partners of a limited partnership.  No special custody arrangements are applicable to a Series of the Trust that would not be applicable to a limited partnership, and the existence of a
trustee should not be taken as an indication of any additional level of management or supervision over a Series of the Trust. To the greatest extent permissible under Delaware law, the Trustee acts in an entirely passive role, delegating all
authority over the operation of each Series of the Trust to the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner is the functional equivalent of a sole general partner in a limited partnership.  Although Units of beneficial interest in a Series need not carry any voting rights, the Declaration of Trust gives Unitholders of each Series voting
rights in respect of the business and affairs of such Series comparable to those typically extended to limited partners in publicly-offered futures funds.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS PROSPECTUS, THERE IS ONLY ONE SERIES OF THE TRUST – SERIES J.  
The Trustee  Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware banking corporation, is the sole Trustee of the Trust and
each Series. The Trustee’s principal offices are located at Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890-0001. The Trustee is unaffiliated with the Managing Owner or the Selling Agents. The Trustee’s duties and
liabilities with respect to the offering of the Units and the administration of each Series of the Trust are limited to its express obligations under the Declaration of Trust.  The rights and duties of the Trustee, the Managing Owner and the Unitholders are governed by the provisions of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and by
the Declaration of Trust.  The Trustee serves as the sole trustee of the Trust and each of the Series in the State of Delaware. The Trustee
will accept service of legal process on the Trust or a Series of the Trust in the State of Delaware and will make certain filings under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act The Trustee does not owe any other duties to the Trust, the Managing Owner or
the Unitholders of a Series. The Trustee is permitted to resign upon at least sixty (60) days’ notice to the Trust, provided, that any such resignation will not be effective until a successor Trustee is appointed by the Managing Owner. The
Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustee is compensated by each Series of the Trust, and is indemnified by each Series of the Trust against any expenses it incurs relating to or arising out of the formation, operation or termination of such
Series or the performance of its duties pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, except to the extent that such expenses result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee. The Managing Owner has the discretion to replace the
Trustee.  The Managing Owner and the Series have signed the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is a part, and only the assets
of the Series and the Managing Owner are subject to issuer liability under the federal securities laws for the information contained in this Prospectus and under federal and state laws with respect to the issuance and sale of the Units. Under such
laws, neither the Trustee, either in its capacity as Trustee or in its individual capacity, nor any director, officer or controlling person of the Trustee is, or has any liability as, the issuer or a director, officer or controlling person of the
issuer of the Units. The Trustee’s liability in connection with the issuance and 
  
-87- 


Table of Contents

sale of the Units is limited solely to the express obligations of the Trustee set forth in the Declaration of Trust.  Under the Declaration of Trust, the Trustee has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of
each Series of the Trust. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. In addition, the Managing
Owner has been designated as the “tax matters partner” of each Series of the Trust for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Unitholders of a Series have no voice in the operations of such Series, other than
certain limited voting rights as set forth in the Declaration of Trust. In the course of its management, the Managing Owner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, appoint an affiliate or affiliates of the Managing Owner as additional managing
owners (except where the Managing Owner has been notified by the Unitholders that it is to be replaced as the managing owner) and retain such persons, including affiliates of the Managing Owner, as it deems necessary for the efficient operation of
the Trust and each of the Series.  Because the Trustee has delegated substantially all of its authority over the operation of each Series
of the Trust to the Managing Owner, the Trustee itself is not registered in any capacity with the CFTC.  
The Managing Owner  Background and Principals  Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. is the Managing Owner and commodity pool operator of the Trust and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenmar Holdings

its affiliates focus on the design and management of investment programs in the hedge fund and managed futures sector. The registration of the Managing Owner with the CFTC and its membership in the NFA must not be taken as an indication that
either the CFTC or the NFA has recommended or approved either the Managing Owner or the Trust.  The Managing Owner and/or its
Affiliates have agreed to purchase and maintain an interest in each Series in an amount not less than 1% of the Net Asset Value of such Series or $25,000, whichever is greater. As of February 29, 2008, the Managing Owner has subscribed for
7,615.94 Series J, Class I General Units and 862.63 Series J, Class II General Units.  Messrs. Shewer and Goodman, as the sole indirect

by Mr. Marc S. Goodman. No other principal of the Managing Owner owns any Units in the Trust or Series J.  Effective
October 1, 2004, the Managing Owner assumed responsibility as the commodity pool operator and managing owner of nine (9) public commodity pools and four open-ended investment companies, which were exempted commodity pools in Ireland.

Owner’s hallmark is its extensive due diligence and emphasis on vigilant management of its portfolios of traders. The Managing Owner analyzes trading and performance on a daily basis and performs ongoing due diligence with respect to each
trader it retains, including the Advisors. This detailed analysis identifies sources of profits and losses for each trader each day, enabling management to make highly informed decisions regarding the performance of each such trader (including the
Trust’s Advisors).  Based on the Managing Owner’s perception of market conditions, Advisor performance and other factors, the
Managing Owner may determine to remove or replace an Advisor or shift to another trading program of an existing Advisor if profitability, risk assumptions or other significant factors indicate that replacement is in the best interests of the
Unitholders of the Trust.  Naturally, these activities require a strong knowledge of trading and markets. The Managing Owner operates and
updates continuously a database that tracks over 600 different trading programs offered by traders around the globe. Added to these quantitative data are qualitative assessments based on detailed trader interviews and analysis of trades, trading
performance and trading strategies.  Fiduciary Obligations of the Managing Owner  As managing owner of the Trust, the Managing Owner is effectively subject to the same restrictions imposed on “fiduciaries” under both statutory
and common law. The Managing Owner has a fiduciary responsibility to the Unitholders to exercise good faith, fairness and loyalty in all dealings affecting the Trust, consistent with the terms of the Trust’s Second Amended and Restated
Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement dated as of September 27, 2005, or the “Declaration of Trust.” The Trust is referred to as the “Trust” in the Declaration of Trust that is attached hereto as Exhibit A. The general
fiduciary duties which would otherwise be imposed on the Managing Owner (which would make the operation of the Trust as described herein impracticable due to the strict prohibition imposed by such duties on, for example, conflicts of interest on
behalf of a fiduciary in its dealings with its beneficiaries), are defined and limited in scope by the disclosure of the business terms of the Trust, as set forth herein and in the Declaration of Trust (to which terms all Unitholders, by subscribing
to the Units, are deemed to consent).  The Trust, as a publicly-offered “commodity pool,” is subject to the Statement of Policy
of the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. relating to the registration, for public offering, of commodity pool interests, or the NASAA Guidelines. The NASAA Guidelines explicitly prohibit a managing owner of a commodity pool
from “contracting away the fiduciary obligation owed to investors under the common law.” Consequently, once the terms of a given commodity pool, such as the Trust, are established, the managing owner is effectively precluded from changing
such 
  
-93- 


Table of Contents

terms in a manner that disproportionately benefits the managing owner, as any such change could constitute self-dealing under common law fiduciary standards,
and it is virtually impossible to obtain the consent of existing investors of the Trust to such self-dealing (whereas, given adequate disclosure, new investors subscribing to a pool should be deemed to evidence their consent to the business terms
thereof by the act of subscribing).  The Declaration of Trust provides that the Managing Owner and its affiliates shall have no liability
to the Trust or to any Unitholder for any loss suffered by the Trust arising out of any action or inaction of the Managing Owner or its affiliates or their directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members or employees, or the Managing Owner
Related Parties, if the Managing Owner Related Parties, in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust, and such course of conduct did not constitute negligence or misconduct by the Managing Owner
Related Parties. The Trust has agreed to indemnify the Managing Owner Related Parties against claims, losses or liabilities based on their conduct relating to the Trust, provided that the conduct resulting in the claims, losses or liabilities for
which indemnity is sought did not constitute negligence or misconduct and was done in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Trust. The NASAA Guidelines prescribe the maximum permissible extent to which the
Trust can indemnify the Managing Owner Related Parties and prohibit the Trust from purchasing insurance to cover indemnification that the Trust itself could not undertake directly.  
Fiduciary and Regulatory Duties of the Managing Owner  An investor should be aware that the Managing Owner
has a fiduciary responsibility to the Unitholders to exercise good faith and fairness in all dealings affecting the Trust.  Under Delaware
law, a beneficial owner of a business trust (such as a Unitholder of the Trust) may, under certain circumstances, institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated beneficial owners, or a class action, to recover damages
from a managing owner of such business trust for violations of fiduciary duties, or on behalf of a business trust (a “derivative action”) to recover damages from a third party where a managing owner has failed or refused to institute
proceedings to recover such damages. In addition, beneficial owners may have the right, subject to certain legal requirements, to bring class actions in federal court to enforce their rights under the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Beneficial owners who have suffered losses in connection with the purchase or sale of their beneficial interests may be able to recover such losses from a
managing owner where the losses result from a violation by the managing owner of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Under certain circumstances, Unitholders also have the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the CFTC against the Managing Owner (a registered commodity pool operator), the Clearing Brokers (registered futures commission
merchants) and the Advisors (registered commodity trading advisors), as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Private rights of action are conferred by the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. Investors in commodities and in commodity pools may, therefore, invoke the protections provided by such legislation.  There are substantial and inherent conflicts of interest in the structure of the Trust that are, on their face, inconsistent with the Managing
Owner’s fiduciary duties. One of the purposes underlying the disclosures set forth in this Prospectus is to disclose to all prospective Unitholders these conflicts of interest so that the Managing Owner may have the opportunity to obtain
investors’ informed consent to such conflicts. Prospective investors who are not willing to consent to the various conflicts of interest described under “Conflicts of Interest” and elsewhere are ineligible to invest in the Trust. The
Managing Owner presently intends to raise such disclosures and consent as a defense in any proceeding brought seeking relief based on the existence of such conflicts of interest.  The foregoing summary describing in general terms the remedies available to Unitholders under federal and state law is based on statutes, rules and
decisions as of the date of this Prospectus. This is a rapidly developing and changing area of the law. Therefore, Unitholders who believe that they may have a legal cause of action against any of the foregoing parties should consult their own
counsel as to their evaluation of the status of the applicable law at such time.

Investment of the Managing Owner in the Trust  The Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates have agreed to
purchase and maintain an interest in each Series in an amount not less than 1% of the Net Asset Value of such Series or $25,000, whichever is greater. As of February 29, 2008, the Managing Owner and its Affiliates have subscribed for 7,615.94
Series J, Class I General Units and 862.63 Series J, Class II General Units.  
Management; Voting by Unitholders  The Unitholders take no part in the management or control, and have no
voice in the operations of the Trust, Series J or their respective businesses. Unitholders, voting together as a single series, may, however, remove and replace the Managing Owner as the managing owner of the Trust and Series J, and may amend the
Declaration of Trust, except in certain limited respects, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding Units then owned by Unitholders (as opposed to by the Managing Owner and its affiliates). The owners of a majority of the outstanding
Units then owned by Unitholders may also compel dissolution of the Trust and Series J. The owners of 10% of the outstanding Units then owned by Unitholders have the right to bring a matter before a vote of the Unitholders. The Managing Owner has no
power under the Declaration of Trust to restrict any of the Unitholders’ voting rights. Any Units purchased by the Managing Owner or its affiliates, as well as the Managing Owner’s general liability interest in Series J, are non-voting.
 The Managing Owner has the right unilaterally to amend the Declaration of Trust as it applies to Series J provided that any such amendment
is for the benefit of and not adverse to the Unitholders of Series J or the Trustee and also in certain unusual circumstances — for example, if doing so is necessary to effect the intent of Series J’s tax allocations or to comply with
certain regulatory requirements.  In the event that the Managing Owner or the Unitholders vote to amend the Declaration of Trust in any
material respect, the amendment will not become effective prior to all Unitholders having an opportunity to redeem their Units.  
Recognition of the Trust and the Series in Certain States  A number of states do not have “business
trust” statutes such as that under which the Trust has been formed in the State of Delaware. It is possible, although unlikely, that a court in such a state could hold that, due to the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary in such
jurisdiction, the Unitholders, although entitled under Delaware law to the same limitation on personal liability as stockholders in a private corporation for profit organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, are not so entitled in such
state. To protect Unitholders against any loss of limited liability, the Declaration of Trust provides that no written obligation may be undertaken by a Series of the Trust unless such obligation is explicitly limited so as not to be enforceable
against any Unitholder personally. Furthermore, each Series itself indemnifies all its Unitholders against any liability that such Unitholders might incur in addition to that of a beneficial owner. The Managing Owner is itself generally liable for
all obligations of each Series of the Trust and will use its assets to satisfy any such liability before such liability would be enforced against any Unitholder individually.  
Possible Repayment of Distributions Received by Unitholders; Indemnification by Unitholders  The Units are
limited liability investments; investors may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment. However, Unitholders of a Series could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate
of such Series any distribution they received at a time when such Series was in fact insolvent or in violation of the Declaration of Trust. In addition, although the Managing Owner is not aware of this provision ever having been invoked in the case
of any public futures fund, Unitholders of a Series agree in the Declaration of Trust that they will indemnify such Series for any harm suffered by it as a result of   


 
•
 
 Unitholders’ actions unrelated to the business of such Series,   


 
•
 
 transfers of their Units in violation of the Declaration of Trust, or   
-95- 


Table of Contents


 
•
 
 taxes imposed on such Series by the states or municipalities in which such investors reside.  The foregoing repayment of distributions and indemnity provisions (other than the provision for Unitholders of a Series indemnifying such Series for
taxes imposed upon it by the state or municipality in which particular Unitholders reside, which is included only as a formality due to the fact that many states do not have business trust statutes so that the tax status of a Series of the Trust in
such states might, theoretically, be challenged — although the Managing Owner is unaware of any instance in which this has actually occurred) are commonplace in publicly-offered commodity pools as well as other trusts and limited partnerships.
 
Transfers of Units Restricted  A Unitholder may, subject to compliance with applicable federal and state
securities laws, assign such Unitholder’s Units upon notice to the Trust and the Managing Owner. No assignment will be effective in respect of the Trust or the Managing Owner until the first day of the month succeeding the month in which such
notice is received. No assignee may become a substituted Unitholder except with the consent of the Managing Owner and upon execution and delivery of an instrument of transfer in form and substance satisfactory to the Managing Owner. No Units may be
transferred where, after the transfer, either the transferee or the transferor would hold less than the minimum number of Units equivalent to an initial minimum purchase, except for transfers by gift, inheritance, intrafamily transfers, family
dissolutions, and transfers to affiliates.  There are, and will be, no certificates for the Units. Any transfers of Units will be reflected
on the books and records of the applicable Series of the Trust. Transferors and transferees of Units will each receive notification from the Managing Owner to the effect that such transfers have been duly reflected as notified to the Managing Owner.
 
Reports to Unitholders  Each month the Managing Owner reports such information as the CFTC may require to be
given to the participants in “commodity pools” such as Series J, and any such other information as the Managing Owner may deem appropriate. The Managing Owner also distributes to Unitholders, generally by March 31 of each year,
certified financial statements and, the tax information related to each Series of the Trust necessary for the preparation of their annual federal income tax returns.  The Managing Owner will notify Unitholders of any change in the fees paid by Series J or of any material changes in the basic investment policies or structure of Series J. Any such notification shall include a
description of Unitholders’ voting rights.  
General  In compliance with the Statement of Policy of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, Inc. relating to the registration of commodity pool programs under state securities or “Blue Sky” laws, the Declaration of Trust provides that:   


 
•
 
 the executing and clearing commissions paid by Series J shall be reasonable, and the Managing Owner shall include in the annual reports containing each Series’
certified financial statements distributed to Unitholders each year the approximate round-turn equivalent rate paid on Series J’s trades during the preceding year;   


 
•
 
 no rebates or give-ups, among other things, may be received from Series J by any of the Selling Agents in respect of sales of the Units of Series J, and such
restriction may not be circumvented by any reciprocal business arrangements among any Selling Agents or any of their respective affiliates and Series J;   


 
•
 
 no trading advisor of Series J (including the Managing Owner) may participate directly or indirectly in any per-trade commodity brokerage commissions generated by
Series J; any agreement between Series J and the Managing Owner or any affiliates of the Managing Owner must be terminable by Series J upon no more than sixty (60) days’ written notice;   


 
•
 
 Series J may make any loans, and the funds of Series K will not be commingled with the funds of any other Series or any other person (deposit of the assets of
Series J with a commodity broker, clearinghouse or currency dealer does not constitute commingling for these purposes); and   


 
•
 
 Series J will not employ the trading technique commonly known as “pyramiding.”

Organizational Chart  The chart below sets forth the ownership of the Managing Owner.  
  All entities in the above chart have their principal place of business at 900 King Street, Suite 100, Rye Brook, New York
10573.  
MATERIAL CONTRACTS  
Advisory Agreements  There is an Advisory Agreement among the Managing Owner, each Advisor and Series J
corresponding to such Advisor by which the Managing Owner delegated to each Advisor sole discretion and responsibility to trade commodities for Series J. The Advisor will place trades based on its agreed-upon trading approach, or the Trading
Approach, which is described under the heading “Series J”, and each Advisor has agreed that at least 90% of the gains and income if any, generated by its Trading Approach will largely result from buying and selling commodities or futures,
forwards, currency spot and options on commodities. All trading is subject to the Trust’s Trading Limitations and Policies, which are described under the heading “Trading Limitations and Policies.” The Advisory Agreements will be
effective for one year after trading commences and will be renewed automatically for additional one-year terms unless terminated. Each Advisory Agreement with an Advisor will terminate automatically:   


 
•
 
 if Series J is terminated; or   


 
•
 
 if, as of the end of any Business Day, the Net Asset Value of the assets allocated to such Advisor (as applicable) declines by 40% from the Net Asset Value of such
Managed Account (a) as of the beginning of the first day of the Advisory Agreement or (b) as of beginning of the first day of any calendar year, in each case after appropriate adjustment for distributions, withdrawals, redemptions,
reallocations and additional allocations.  Each Advisory Agreement may be terminated at the discretion of Series J at any
time upon 30 days’ prior written notice to an Advisor. Also, each Advisory Agreement may be terminated at the discretion of Series J upon prior written notice to the Advisor for cause, which may include the following:   


 
•
 
 Series J determines in good faith that the Advisor is unable to use its agreed upon Trading Approach to any material extent;   


 
•
 
 the Advisor’s registration as a CTA (if required) under the CE Act or membership as a CTA

with the NFA is revoked, suspended, terminated or not renewed;   


 
•
 
 Series J determines in good faith that the Advisor has failed to conform and, after receipt of written notice, continues to fail to conform in any material respect,
to (A) the Trading Limitations and Policies, or (B) the Advisor’s Trading Approach;   


 
•
 
 there is an unauthorized assignment of the Advisory Agreement by the Advisor;   


 
•
 
 the Advisor dissolves, merges or consolidates with another entity or sells a substantial portion of its assets, any portion of its Trading Approach utilized by
Series J or its business goodwill, in each instance without the consent of Series J;   


 
•
 
 the Advisor becomes bankrupt or insolvent; or   


 
•
 
 for any other reason if Series J determines in good faith that the termination is essential for the protection of the assets of Series J including, without
limitation, a good faith determination by Series J that such Advisor has breached a material obligation to Series J under the Advisory Agreement relating to the trading of the assets of the Trading Vehicle or Series J, as applicable.
 Each Advisor also has the right to terminate the Advisory Agreement in its discretion at any time for cause in the
event:   


 
•
 
 of the receipt by the Advisor of an opinion of independent counsel satisfactory to the Advisor and Series J that by reason of the Advisor’s activities with
respect to Series J, the Advisor is required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and it is not so registered;   


 
•
 
 the registration of the Managing Owner as a CPO under the CE Act or membership as a CPO with the NFA is revoked, suspended, terminated or not renewed;
  


 
•
 
 Series J imposes additional trading limitation(s) which the Advisor does not agree to follow in its trading of the assets of Series J; or Series J overrides trading
instructions;   


 
•
 
 the assets allocated to the Advisor decrease, for any reason, to less than an amount specified in the particular Advisory Agreement; 
 


 
•
 
 Series J elects to have the Advisor use a different Trading Approach and the Advisor objects;   


 
•
 
 there is an unauthorized assignment of the Advisory Agreement by Series J;   


 
•
 
 the material breach of the Advisory Agreement by Series J after giving written notice to Series J that identifies such breach, and such material breach has not been
cured within ten (10) days following receipt of such notice by Series J;   


 
•
 
 the Advisor provides Series J with written notice as specified in the particular Advisory Agreement; or   


 
•
 
 other good cause is shown and the written consent of Series J is obtained (which shall not unreasonably be withheld).  In addition to the trading management services each Advisor provides pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, each Advisor also is permitted to manage and
trade accounts for other investors (including other public and private commodity pools), and trade for its own account, and for the accounts of its partners, shareholders, directors, officers and employees, using the same Trading Approach and other
information it uses on behalf of Series J, so long as in the Advisor’s reasonable judgment the aggregate amount of capital being managed or traded by the Advisor does not (i) materially impair the Advisor’s ability to carry out its
obligations and duties to Series J pursuant to the Advisory Agreement or (ii) create a reasonable likelihood of the Advisor having to modify materially its agreed upon Trading Approach being used for Series J in a manner which might reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Series J. Each Advisor will, upon reasonable request, permit the Managing Owner or Series J to review at the Advisor’s offices such trading records that the Managing Owner or Series J may
reasonably request.  None of the Advisors nor their officers, directors, partners, shareholders or employees or controlling persons will be
liable to Series J its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees or controlling persons, except by reason of acts or omissions in material breach of the Advisory Agreement or due to their willful misconduct or gross negligence or by
reason of not having acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that such actions or omissions were in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Series J it being understood that none of the Advisors makes any guarantee of profit and

provides no protection against loss, and that all purchases and sales of commodities are for the account and risk of Series J and that the Advisors shall
incur no liability for trading profits or losses resulting therefrom except as set forth above. Each of the Advisors, and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, partners, employees and controlling persons, will be indemnified and held
harmless by Series J and the Managing Owner from and against any losses liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) and amounts paid in settlement of any claims, collectively, Losses, sustained by the
Advisor in connection with any acts or omissions of the Advisor or its partners, officers, directors, shareholders or employees relating to their management of Series J or as a result of any material breach of the Advisory Agreement by Series J or
the Managing Owner, provided that:   


 
•
 
 such Losses were not the result of negligence or misconduct or a material breach of the Advisory Agreement on the part of the Advisor or its partners, officers,
directors, shareholders or employees or controlling persons;   


 
•
 
 the Advisor, and its shareholders, directors, officers, partners, employees and each person controlling the Advisor, acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably
believed by such person to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Series J; and   


 
•
 
 any such indemnification will be recoverable from the assets of Series J; provided. however, that no indemnification shall be permitted for amounts paid in
settlement if Series J does not approve the amount of the settlement (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  Expenses incurred by an indemnified person in defending a threatened or pending civil, administrative or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by Series J in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding
if:   


 
•
 
 the legal action, suit or proceeding, if sustained, would entitle the indemnitee to indemnification under the terms of the Advisory Agreement; and
  


 
•
 
 the Advisor undertakes to repay the advanced funds to Series J in cases in which the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the terms of the Advisory
Agreement.  Series J has the right to offer to settle any indemnity matter with the approval of the applicable Advisor
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  
Brokerage Agreement  The Clearing Broker and the Trust on behalf of Series J entered into a brokerage
agreement, or each, a Brokerage Agreement. As a result the Clearing Broker:   


 
•
 
 acts as the executing and clearing broker with respect to Series J;   


 
•
 
 acts as custodian of Series J’s assets;   


 
•
 
 assists with foreign currency; and   


 
•
 
 performs such other services for the Trust and Series J as the Managing Owner may from time to time request.  As executing and clearing broker for Series J, the Clearing Broker receives each Advisor’s orders for trades. Generally, when an Advisor gives an
instruction either to sell or buy a particular foreign currency forward contract, Series J engages in back-to-back principal trades with the Clearing Brokers in order to carry out the Advisor’s instructions. In back-to-back currency
transactions, a Clearing Broker, as principal, arranges bank lines of credit and contracts to make or to take future delivery of specified amounts of the currency at the negotiated price. The Clearing Broker, again as principal, in turn contracts
with Series J to make or take future delivery of the same specified amounts of currencies at the same price. In these transactions, such Clearing Broker acts in the best interests of Series J.  Confirmations of all executed trades are given to the Trust by the Clearing Broker. The Brokerage Agreement incorporates the Clearing Broker’s
standard customer agreements and related documents, which generally include provisions that:   


 
•
 
 all funds, commodities and open or cash positions carried for Series J will be held as security for their respective obligations to the Clearing Broker;
  


 
•
 
 the margins required to initiate or maintain open positions will be as from time to time established by the Clearing Brokers and may exceed exchange minimum levels;
and   


 
•
 
 each Clearing Broker may close out positions, purchase commodities or cancel orders at any time it 
  
-99-

deems necessary for its protection, without the consent of Series J.  As custodian of Series J’s assets, the Clearing Brokers are responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and
actions taken by Series J during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of Series J.  Administrative functions provided by the Clearing Brokers for Series J include, but are not limited to, preparing and transmitting daily confirmations of
transactions and monthly statements of account, calculating equity balances and margin requirements.  As long as the Brokerage Agreement
between it and the Trust (on behalf of Series J) is in effect, each Clearing Broker will not charge a fee for any of the services it has agreed to perform, except for the agreed-upon brokerage fee.  Each Brokerage Agreement is not exclusive and runs for successive one-year terms to be renewed automatically each year unless terminated. Each Brokerage
Agreement is terminable by the Trust on behalf of Series J or UBS Securities without penalty upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (unless where certain events of default occur or there is a material adverse change in such
Series’ financial position, in which case only prior written notice is required to terminate the Brokerage Agreement).  The Brokerage
Agreement provides that neither UBS Securities nor any of its managing directors, officers, employees or affiliates shall be liable for any costs, losses, penalties, fines, taxes and damages sustained or incurred by Series J other than as a result
of UBS Securities negligence or reckless or intentional misconduct or breach of such agreement.  
Selling Agreement  The Selling Agent has entered into an Amended and Restated Selling Agreement, or Selling
Agent Agreement, with the Trust and the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner and the Selling Agent intend to appoint certain other broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and members of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, or FINRA (formerly the NASD), as additional selling agents, or Correspondent Selling Agents. Each Correspondent Selling Agent has signed a Correspondent Selling Agent Agreement, as amended from time-to-time with the Trust and
the Selling Agent. The Selling Agent and each Correspondent Selling Agent will use their “best efforts” to sell Units. This means that the Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents are not required to purchase any Units or sell
any specific number or dollar amount of Units but will use their best efforts to sell the Units offered.  The Selling Agent and each
Correspondent Selling Agent, in recommending to any person the purchase or sale of Units, will use commercially reasonable efforts to determine, on the basis of information obtained from the prospective purchaser concerning the prospective
purchaser’s investment objectives, the prospective purchaser’s other investments and the prospective purchaser’s financial situation and needs, and any other information known by the Selling Agent or the Correspondent Selling Agent,
as applicable, through the review of its offeree questionnaire completed by such prospective purchaser and maintain in the Selling Agent’s or the Correspondent Selling Agent’s files documents disclosing the basis upon which the
determination of suitability was reached as to each purchaser.  In connection with the offer, sale and distribution of the Units, the
Selling Agent and each Correspondent Selling Agent has agreed that it will comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations, and the rules, policy statements and interpretations of the FINRA, the SEC, the CFTC, state securities administrators
and any other regulatory or self-regulatory body. The Selling Agent and each Correspondent Selling Agent has agreed that it will not execute any sales of Units from a discretionary account over which it has control without prior written approval of
the customer in whose name such discretionary account is being maintained.  The Selling Agent Agreement (and any Correspondent Selling
Agent Agreement) will be terminated at the conclusion of the offering with respect to each Series. Prior to the conclusion of the offering, the Selling Agent Agreement (and any Correspondent Selling Agent Agreement) may be terminated by the Selling
Agent, at the Selling Agent’s option, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice to the Trust and the Managing Owner, in the event:   


 
•
 
 there is, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or
otherwise, of the Trust or the Managing Owner which, in the judgment of the Selling Agent, 
  
-100- 


Table of Contents


 
 
renders it inadvisable to proceed with the offer and sale of the Units;   


 
•
 
 the Registration Statement and/or the Prospectus is not amended promptly after written request by the Selling Agent for it to be so amended because an event has
occurred which, in the opinion of counsel for the Selling Agent, should be set forth in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading;   


 
•
 
 any of the conditions specified in Section 7 (relating to covenants of the Managing Owner) of the Selling Agent Agreement are not fulfilled when and as
required by the Selling Agent Agreement to be fulfilled;   


 
•
 
 there is a general suspension of, or a general limitation on prices for, trading in commodity futures or option contracts on commodity exchanges in the United
States or other commodities instruments, or there is any other national or international calamity or crisis in the financial markets of the United States to the extent that it is determined by the Selling Agent, in its discretion, that such
limitations would materially impede the Trust’s trading activities or make the offering or delivery of the Units impossible or impractical; or   


 
•
 
 there is a declaration of a banking moratorium by Federal, New York or Delaware authorities. In addition, each Selling Agent Agreement may be terminated by written
agreement among the parties to the Selling Agent Agreement.  The Selling Agent and the Correspondent Selling Agents shall
not be liable to the Trust, the Trustee or the Managing Owner for any act or failure to act on behalf of the Trust, if such act or failure to act on the part of the Selling Agent, the Correspondent Selling Agent or their respective principals or
affiliates did not constitute negligence, misconduct or a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Selling Agent or Correspondent Selling Agent, as the case may be, contained in the Selling Agent Agreement or
Correspondent Selling Agent Agreement, as the case may be.  The Managing Owner and the Trust will indemnify and hold harmless the Selling
Agent, the Correspondent Selling Agents and their respective principals and affiliates from and against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage, expense, fine, penalty, cost or expense (including, without limitation, attorneys’ and
accountants’ fees and disbursements), judgments and amounts paid in settlement, or Losses, to which the Selling Agent, the Correspondent Selling Agent or their respective principals and affiliates may become subject arising out of or in
connection with the Selling Agent Agreement or the Correspondent Selling Agent Agreement, as the case may be, the transactions contemplated thereby or the fact that the Selling Agent or Correspondent Selling Agent is or was a selling agent of the
Trust arising out of or based upon:   


 
•
 
 any untrue statement of material fact contained in the Selling Agent Agreement or Correspondent Selling Agent Agreement, as applicable, the Prospectus or any
application or written communication executed by the Managing Owner or the Trust filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Units under the securities laws thereof;   


 
•
 
 any omission from such documents of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; or
  


 
•
 
 any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Managing Owner or the Trust in the Selling Agent Agreement, except to the extent that
any such Losses arise out of, relate to, or are based upon the Selling Agent’s failure to meet the standard of liability applicable to it under the Selling Agent Agreement.  The Selling Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust, the Trustee and the Managing Owner and the Principals and Affiliates of the Trustee
and the Managing Owner from and against all Losses incurred by any of them arising out of or based upon the Selling Agent’s failure to meet the standard of liability set forth in the Selling Agent Agreement.  
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES  The following constitutes the opinion of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP and
summarizes the material federal income tax consequences to United States taxpayers who are individuals.  
Partnership Tax Status of Series J  In the opinion of counsel, Series J will be classified as a partnership
for federal income tax purposes and, based on the Managing Owner’s representations as to the type of income expected to be earned by Series J, will not be treated as a 
  
-101- 


Table of Contents

“publicly-traded partnership” taxable as a corporation.  
Taxation of Unitholders on Profits or Losses  Each Unitholder will be subject to tax on such
Unitholder’s share of Series J’s income and gains, if any, even if such Unitholders do receive any cash distributions or redeem Units. In addition, a Unitholder may be subject to payment of taxes on Series J’s interest income even
though the Net Asset Value per Unit of Series J has decreased due to trading losses. See “--Tax on Capital Gains and Losses; Interest Income” on the following page.  Series J provides each of its Unitholders with an annual schedule of such Unitholder’s share of tax items. Series J generally allocates these items
of gain and loss equally to each Unit. However, when a Unitholder redeems Units, Series J shall allocate capital gains or losses to the Unitholder of Series J so as to reduce or eliminate any difference between the redemption proceeds and the tax
basis of such Units. A Unitholder’s adjusted tax basis in a Unit equals the amount originally paid for the Unit, increased by income or gains allocated to the Unit and decreased (but not below zero) by distributions, deductions or losses
allocated to the Unit.  
Limited Deductibility of Trust Losses and Deductions  A Unitholder may not deduct losses or deductions in
excess of his or her tax basis in his or her Units as of year-end. Generally, a Unitholder’s tax basis in such Unitholder’s Units is the amount paid for such Units reduced (but not below zero) by such Unitholder’s share of any
distributions, losses and deductions and increased by such Unitholder’s share of income and gains. However, a Unitholder subject to “at-risk” limitations (generally non-corporate taxpayers and closely-held corporations) can only
deduct losses to the extent he is “at-risk.” The “at-risk” amount is similar to tax basis, except that it does not include any amount borrowed on a non-recourse basis or from someone with an interest in the Trust.  
Limited Deductibility for Certain Expenses  The Managing Owner does not consider the Incentive Fee, as well
as other ordinary expenses of Series J, to be investment advisory expenses or other expenses of producing income. Accordingly, for tax reporting purposes, the Managing Owner currently treats the ordinary expenses of Series J as ordinary business
expenses not subject to the limitations that apply to investment advisory expenses described below. However, the IRS might contend otherwise and to the extent the IRS recharacterizes these expenses, a Unitholder would have the amount of the ordinary
expenses allocated to him treated accordingly.  Individual taxpayers are subject to material limitations on their ability to deduct
investment advisory fees, unreimbursed expenses of an employee, and certain other expenses of producing income not resulting from the conduct of a trade or business. For individuals who itemize deductions, the expenses of producing such income,
including “investment advisory fees,” are aggregated with unreimbursed employee business expenses, certain other expenses of producing income and deductions, or collectively, the Aggregate Investment Expenses, and such Aggregate Investment
Expenses are deductible only to the extent such amount exceeds 2% of the individual’s adjusted gross income. In addition, Aggregate Investment Expenses in excess of the 2% threshold, when combined with certain other itemized deductions, are
subject to a reduction generally equal to the lesser of one-thrid of 3% of the individual’s adjusted gross income in excess of a certain threshold amount and 80% of certain itemized deductions otherwise allowable for the tax year. Moreover,
such Aggregate Investment Expenses are miscellaneous itemized deductions, which are not deductible by an individual in calculating his or her alternative minimum tax liability.  If the Profit Shares, the Incentive Fee and other expenses of Series J were determined to constitute “investment advisory fees,” an individual
Unitholder’s pro rata share of the amounts so characterized would be included in Aggregate Investment Expenses potentially subject to the deduction limitations described above. In addition, each individual Unitholder’s share of
income from Series J would be increased (solely for tax purposes) by such Unitholder’s pro rata share of the amounts so characterized. Any such characterization by the IRS could require Unitholders to file amended tax returns and pay additional
taxes, plus interest. It is unlikely that tax penalties would be imposed on account of such an IRS characterization.  
Year-End Mark-to-Market of Open Section 1256 Contract Positions  Section 1256 Contracts are futures,
options on futures and stock index options traded on U.S. exchanges and certain foreign currency contracts. Section 1256 Contracts that remain open at the end of 
  
-102- 


Table of Contents

a tax year are treated for tax purposes as if such positions had been sold at year-end and any gain or loss is recognized. The gain or loss on
Section 1256 Contracts is characterized as 40% short-term capital gain or loss and 60% long-term capital gain or loss regardless of how long any given position has been held. Non-Section 1256 Contracts include, among other things, certain
foreign currency transactions and non-U.S. exchange traded futures. Gain or loss on any non-Section 1256 Contracts is recognized when sold by a Series and are primarily short-term gain or loss.  
Tax on Capital Gains and Losses; Interest Income  As described under “— Year-End Mark-to-Market of
Open Section 1256 Contract Positions,” Series J’s trading, not including its cash management which generates primarily ordinary income, generates 60% long-term capital gains or losses and 40% short-term capital gains or losses from
its Section 1256 Contracts and primarily short-term capital gain or loss from any non-Section 1256 Contracts. Individuals pay tax on long-term capital gains at a maximum rate of 15%. Short-term capital gains are subject to tax at the same
rates as ordinary income.  Individual taxpayers may deduct capital losses only to the extent of their capital gains plus $3,000.
Accordingly, Series J could incur significant losses but a Unitholder could be required to pay taxes on such Unitholder’s share of Series J’s interest income.  If an individual taxpayer incurs a net capital loss for a year, he may elect to carry back (up to three years) the portion of such loss that consists of a net loss on Section 1256 Contracts. A taxpayer may deduct
such losses only against net capital gain for a carryback year to the extent that such gain includes gains on Section 1256 Contracts. To the extent that a taxpayer could not use such losses to offset gains on Section 1256 Contracts in a
carryback year, the taxpayer may carry forward such losses indefinitely as losses on Section 1256 Contracts.  
Syndication Expenses  Neither Series J nor any Unitholder of Series J will be entitled to any deduction for
Series J’s syndication expenses, including offering expense reimbursements paid to the Managing Owner and any amounts paid to any Selling Agents, nor can such expenses be amortized by Series J or any Unitholder. Such expenses may be included in
capital losses upon redemption.  
Unrelated Business Taxable Income  Tax-exempt Unitholders of Series J generally will not be required to pay
tax on their share of income or gains of Series J, provided that such Unitholders do not purchase Units with borrowed funds. Certain tax-exempt Unitholders may be subject to special set-aside requirements or excise taxes as to which they should
consult their tax advisers.  
IRS Audits of Series J and Their Respective Unitholders  If Series J is audited, the IRS is required to audit
Series J-related items at the Series level rather than the Unitholder level. The Managing Owner is the “tax matters partner” of Series J with general authority to determine Series J’s responses to a tax audit. If an audit of Series J
results in an adjustment, all Unitholders of Series J may be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties.  
State and Other Taxes  In addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, Series J and its
Unitholders may be subject to various state and other taxes.  
Tax Elections  The Managing Owner has the discretion to make any election available to Series J under the
Code. Such elections may affect the timing and/or character of gains and losses generated by Series J.      Prospective investors are
urged to consult their tax advisers before deciding whether to invest.

PURCHASES BY EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS  Although there can be no assurance that an investment in Series J, or any other managed futures product, will achieve the investment objectives of an
employee benefit plan in making such investment, futures investments have certain features that may be of interest to such a plan. For example, the futures markets are one of the few investment fields in which employee benefit plans can participate
in leveraged strategies without being required to pay tax on “unrelated business taxable income.” See “Federal Income Tax Consequences — ‘Unrelated Business Taxable Income’” at page 103. In addition, because they
are not taxpaying entities, employee benefit plans are not subject to paying annual tax on profits (if any) of Series J.  As a
matter of policy, the Managing Owner will attempt to limit subscriptions to Series J from any employee benefit plan to no more than 10% of the value of the readily marketable assets of such plan (irrespective of the net worth of the beneficiary or
beneficiaries of such plan).  
General  In general, the terms “employee benefit plan” as defined in ERISA and “plan” as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provide retirement benefits or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer’s employees and their beneficiaries. Such plans and
accounts include, but are not limited to, corporate pension and profit sharing plans, “simplified employee pension plans,” KEOGH plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), individual retirement accounts described in
Section 408 of the Code and medical plans.  Each Plan Fiduciary must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances
that are relevant to an investment in Series J, including the role that an investment in such Series would play in the Plan’s overall investment portfolio. Each Plan Fiduciary, before deciding to invest in Series J, must be satisfied that such
investment is prudent for the Plan, that the investments of the Plan, including the investment in Series J, are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses and that an investment in Series J complies with the Plan and related trust.
 EACH PLAN FIDUCIARY CONSIDERING ACQUIRING UNITS MUST CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL AND TAX ADVISERS BEFORE DOING SO. AN INVESTMENT IN
SERIES J IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. SERIES J IS NOT INTENDED AS A COMPLETE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.  
“Plan Assets”  A regulation issued under ERISA, or the ERISA Regulation, contains rules for
determining when an investment by a Plan in an entity will result in the underlying assets of such entity being assets of the Plan for purposes of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (i.e., “plan assets”). Those rules provide that
assets of an entity will not be considered assets of a Plan that purchases an equity interest in the entity if certain exceptions apply, including (i) an exception applicable if the equity interest purchased is a “publicly-offered
security”, or the Publicly-Offered Security Exception, and (ii) an exception applicable if the investment by all “benefit plan investors” is not “significant,” or the Significant Participation Exception. A Series will
rely on the Significant Participation Exception until such time as such Series satisfies the conditions of the Publicly-Offered Security Exception. Series J currently satisfies the conditions of, and relies on the exception provided by, the
Publicly-Offered Security Exception.  The Significant Participation Exception applies if investments by benefit plan investors are not
significant. The term “benefit plan investors” includes all Plans (i.e., all “employee benefit plans” as defined in and subject to ERISA and all “plans” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code), all
“employee benefit plans” and “plans” as defined in but not subject to either ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and all entities that hold “plan assets” due to investments made in such entities by already described
benefit plan investors. In addition, all or a portion of an investment made by an insurance company using assets from its general account may be treated as a benefit plan investor. Investments by benefit plan investors will be deemed not significant
if benefit plan investors own, in the aggregate, less than 25% of the total capital of each class of equity interests in the entity (determined by not including the investments of persons with discretionary authority or control over the assets of
such entity, of any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets, and “affiliates” (as defined in the regulations issued under ERISA) of such persons).   
-104- 


Table of Contents
During any time that Series J is relying on the Significant Participation Exception in order to avoid
causing assets of Series J to be “plan assets,” the Managing Owner intends to restrict the aggregate investment by benefit plan investors to under 25% of the total capital of each class of equity interests of Series J (not including the
investments of the Trustee, the Managing Owner, any of the Advisors, any person who provides investment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to the assets of Series J, and any entity that is directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of such entities (including a partnership or any other similar entity for which the Managing Owner is the general partner (or the functional equivalent thereof) or provides
investment advice), and each of the principals, officers and employees of any of the foregoing entities who has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of such entity or of the Trust). Furthermore, because the
25% test is ongoing, it not only restricts additional investments by benefit plan investors, but also can cause the Managing Owner to require that existing benefit plan investors withdraw from Series J in the event that other investors withdraw. If
rejection of subscriptions or such mandatory withdrawals are necessary, as determined by the Managing Owner, to avoid causing the assets of the Trust to be “plan assets,” the Managing Owner will effect such rejections or withdrawals in
such manner as the Managing Owner, in its sole discretion, determines.  The Publicly-Offered Security Exception applies if the equity
interest is a security that is (1) “freely transferable,” (2) part of a class of securities that is “widely held” and (3) either (a) part of a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), or (b) sold to the Plan as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and
the class of which such security is a part is registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days (or such later time as may be allowed by the SEC) after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer in which the offering of such security occurred. The
ERISA Regulation states that the determination of whether a security is “freely transferable” is to be made based on all relevant facts and circumstances. The ERISA Regulation specifies that, in the case of a security that is part of an
offering in which the minimum investment is $10,000 or less, the following requirements, alone or in combination, ordinarily will not affect a finding that the security is freely transferable: (i) a requirement that no transfer or assignment of
the security or rights in respect thereof be made that would violate any federal or state law; (ii) a requirement that no transfer or assignment be made without advance written notice given to the entity that issued the security; and
(iii) any restriction on substitution of an assignee as “a limited partner of a partnership, including a general partner consent requirement, provided that the economic benefits of ownership of the assignor may be transferred or assigned
without regard to such restriction or consent” (other than compliance with any of the foregoing restrictions). Under the ERISA Regulation, a class of securities is “widely held” only if it is of a class of securities owned by 100 or
more investors independent of the issuer and of each other. A class of securities will not fail to be widely held solely because subsequent to the initial offering the number of independent investors falls below 100 as a result of events beyond the
issuer’s control.  The Publicly Offered Security Exception applies with respect to Units of Series J. First, the Units of Series J are
being sold only as part of a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, and were registered under the Exchange Act within 120 days (or such later time as allowed by the SEC) after the end of the fiscal
year of such Series in which the offering of such Units occurred.  Second, it appears that Units of Series J are freely transferable
because the minimum investment is not more than $5,000 and Unitholders may assign their economic interests in such Series by giving written notice to the Managing Owner, provided such assignment would not violate any federal or state securities laws
and would not adversely affect the tax status of such Series. As described in the second preceding paragraph, the ERISA Regulation provides that if a security is part of an offering in which the minimum investment is $10,000 or less, a restriction
on substitution of a limited partner of a partnership, including a general partner consent requirement, will not prevent a finding that the security is freely transferable, provided that the economic benefits of ownership can be transferred without
such consent. Although this provision, read literally, applies only to partnerships, the Managing Owner believes that because the determination as to whether a security is freely transferable is based on the facts and circumstances, the fact that
the Units, which are issued by a series of a statutory trust rather than a partnership, have an identical restriction should not affect a finding that the Series J Units are freely transferable.

Third, the Units of Series J expected owned by more than 100 investors who are independent of the Trust
and of each other.  
Ineligible Purchasers  Units may not be purchased with the assets of a Plan if the Managing Owner, any of the
Advisors, the Selling Agents, any Clearing Broker, any of the brokers through which any Advisor requires Series J to trade, Series J or any of their respective affiliates, any of their respective employees or any employees of their respective
affiliates: (a) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such Plan assets; (b) has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to such Plan assets, for a fee, and pursuant to an
agreement or understanding that such advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to such Plan assets and that such advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the Plan; or (c) is an employer
maintaining or contributing to such Plan. A party that is described in clause (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence is a fiduciary under ERISA and the Code with respect to the Plan, and any such purchase might result in a “prohibited
transaction” under ERISA and the Code.  Except as otherwise set forth, the foregoing statements regarding the consequences under ERISA
and the Code of an investment in Series J are based on the provisions of the Code and ERISA as currently in effect, and the existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereunder. No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial or
legislative changes will not occur that will not make the foregoing statements incorrect or incomplete.  ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS ON
BEHALF OF PLANS IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE TRUST, SERIES J, THE MANAGING OWNER, ANY ADVISOR, ANY CLEARING BROKERS, THE SELLING AGENTS OR ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THIS INVESTMENT MEETS SOME OR ALL OF THE RELEVANT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH
RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY ANY PARTICULAR PLAN OR THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN. THE PERSON WITH INVESTMENT DISCRETION SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER ATTORNEY AND FINANCIAL ADVISERS AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF AN INVESTMENT
IN SERIES J UNITS IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR PLAN AND CURRENT TAX LAW.  
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION  
The Offering  Units of Series J are offered continuously to the public — on a “best-efforts”
basis — at their month-end Net Asset Value per Unit. The minimum investment is $5,000 in the aggregate except for (i) trustees or custodians of eligible employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts and (ii) existing
Unitholders subscribing for additional Units, where the minimum investment is $2,000 in the aggregate. The Managing Owner, in its sole discretion, may waive the minimums. Units will be issued as of the commencement of business on the first Business
Day of each month.  
Subscription Procedure  To purchase Units, an investor must complete, execute and deliver a copy of the
Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Pages. Existing investors in a Series must execute new Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Pages and verify their continued suitability to make additional investments and
must have received a current Prospectus for the Trust. Subscription payments may be made by wire transfer or by authorizing a Selling Agent to debit a subscriber’s customer securities account for the amount of his or her subscription. When
a subscriber authorizes such a debit (which authorization is given in the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney), the subscriber is required to have the amount of his or her subscription payment on deposit in his or her account as of the
settlement date specified by the relevant Selling Agent — generally, the fifth Business Day after the date of purchase (the first day of the month immediately following the month during which a subscription is accepted) if the Subscription
Agreement and Power of Attorney is executed and delivered at least five (5) Business Days prior to the end of such month.  The Units
are sold when, as and if subscriptions therefore are accepted by the Managing Owner, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Selling Agent Agreement and to the approval by counsel of certain legal matters.  All subscriptions will be irrevocable by the subscriber, except as set forth below. In the Subscription Agreement, you are required to represent that you
received the Prospectus five (5) days prior to the date of receipt of your Subscription Agreement. We are prohibited from selling Units to 
  
-106- 


Table of Contents

you until five (5) days after you receive the Prospectus. Rejected or revoked subscriptions will be returned with interest. No fees or other amounts
will be deducted from your subscription, which will be returned to you within seven (7) Business Days after such rejection. Subscriptions which are received after the subscription deadline for any month will be deemed to be a subscription to
purchase Units as of the first Business Day of the next succeeding month, subject to acceptance by the Managing Owner, satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Selling Agent Agreement and approval by counsel of certain legal matters.
 All subscribers will receive a confirmation of their purchase from their Selling Agent.  There is no minimum number of Units that must be sold as of the beginning of a given month for any Units to be sold at such time.  
Subscribers’ Representations and Warranties  By executing a Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney
Signature Page, each subscriber is representing and warranting, among other things, that:   


 
•
 
 the subscriber is of legal age to execute and deliver such Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney and has full power and authority to do so;
  


 
•
 
 the subscriber has read and understands Exhibit B to this Prospectus and meets or exceeds the applicable suitability criteria of net worth and annual income set
forth therein; and   


 
•
 
 the subscriber has received a copy of this Prospectus.  These representations and warranties might be used by the Managing Owner or others against a subscriber in the event that the subscriber were to take a position inconsistent therewith.  While the foregoing representations and warranties are binding on subscribers, the Managing Owner believes that to a large extent such representations
and warranties would be implied from the fact that an investor has subscribed for Units. Any subscriber who is not prepared to give such representations and warranties, and to be bound by them, should not invest in the Units.  
LEGAL MATTERS  Legal matters in connection with the Units being offered hereby, including the discussion of
the material income tax considerations relating to the Units, have been passed upon for the Trust, Series J and the Managing Owner by Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP also advises the Managing Owner with respect to its
responsibilities as managing owner of, and with respect to matters relating to, the Trust and Series J.

PERFORMANCE OF COMMODITY POOLS OPERATED BY  THE MANAGING OWNER AND ITS AFFILIATES  
General  The performance information included herein is presented in accordance with CFTC regulations.
Each Series of the Trust differs materially in certain respects from each of the pools whose performance is included herein. The following sets forth summary performance information for all pools operated by the Managing Owner (other than the
Trust and the Series) since January 1, 2002. The Managing Owner has offered certain of these pools exclusively on a private basis to financially sophisticated investors — either on a private placement basis in the United States or offshore
exclusively to non-U.S. persons.  The pools, the performance of which is summarized herein, are materially different in certain respects
from the Series of the Trust, and the past performance summaries of such pools are generally not representative of how a Series of the Trust might perform in the future. These pools also have material differences from one another in terms of number
of advisors, leverage, fee structure and trading programs. The performance records of these pools may give some general indication of the Managing Owner’s capabilities in advisor selection by indicating the past performance of the pools
sponsored by the Managing Owner.  Effective October 1, 2004, the Managing Owner assumed responsibility as the commodity pool operator
and managing owner of nine (9) public commodity pools and four open-ended investment companies, which were exempted commodity pools in Ireland. Effective as of February 29, 2008, the Managing Owner serves as the commodity pool operator and
managing owner of seven (7) public commodity pools (including Series J) and one open-ended investment company, which is an exempted commodity pool in Ireland.  All summary performance information is current as of February 29, 2008 (except in the case of pools dissolved prior to such date). Performance information is set forth, in accordance with CFTC Regulations, since
January 1, 2003 or, if later, the inception of the pool in question. CFTC Regulations require inclusion of only performance information within the five most recent calendar years and year-to-date. Performance information with respect to the
newly acquired pools in which the Managing Owner serves either as managing owner or general partner is disclosed starting as of October 1, 2004.  INVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THAT AFFILIATES OF THE MANAGING OWNER PERFORM ASSET ALLOCATION FUNCTIONS ON BEHALF OF MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND OTHER COMMODITY POOLS SIMILAR TO THOSE PERFORMED BY THE MANAGING OWNER. PURSUANT TO CFTC
REGULATIONS, THE PERFORMANCE OF ACCOUNTS AND OTHER POOLS OPERATED, MANAGED AND/OR SPONSORED BY AFFILIATES OF THE MANAGING OWNER HAS NOT BEEN INCLUDED HEREIN.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND MATERIAL DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN THE POOLS WHOSE PERFORMANCE IS SUMMARIZED HEREIN AND SERIES J.  INVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THAT INTEREST INCOME MAY CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A COMMODITY POOL’S INCOME AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, MAY GENERATE
PROFITS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM COMMODITY TRADING.

1.
Name of Pool.   


2.
Type of Pool:  “Single” means that the assets
are managed by one commodity trading advisor.  * Although multiple commodity trading advisors were used at certain times during the history
of the pool, the pool may not have been a “multi-advisor pool” as defined by the CFTC due to the fact that one of those commodity trading advisors may have been allocated in excess of twenty-five percent of the pool’s funds available
for trading.  ** Commenced trading as a single-advisor pool and assets were subsequently allocated to multiple trading advisors. The pool is
not a “multi-advisor-pool” as defined by the CFTC for the reason discussed above.  *** Commenced trading as a multi-advisor pool
and assets were subsequently allocated to a single trading advisor. The pools are not “multi-advisor-pools” as defined by the CFTC for the reason discussed above.   


3.
Start Date. Pools that were purchased by the Managing Owner have existed prior to the effective date of ownership, October 1, 2004, and performance with respect to such
recently purchased pools has been disclosed starting as of October 1, 2004, as applicable.   


4.
“Close Date” is the date the pool liquidated its assets and ceased to do business.   


5.
“Aggregate Subscript.” is the aggregate of all amounts ever contributed to the pool, including investors who subsequently redeemed their investments.
  


6.
“Current Total NAV” is the Net Asset Value of the pool as of February 29, 2008, unless otherwise noted as of February 29, 2008.   


7.
“Current NAV Per Unit” is the Current Net Asset Value of the pool divided by the total number of units (shares) outstanding as of February 29, 2008, unless otherwise
noted as of February 29, 2008. Current NAV per Unit is based on the value of a hypothetical $1,000 unit of investment over time.  In the case of liquidated pools, the NAV per unit on the date of liquidation of the pool is set forth.   


8.
“% Worst Monthly Drawdown” is the largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading. “Drawdown” as used in this section of the Prospectus means
losses experienced by the relevant pool over the specified period and is calculated on a rate of return basis, i.e., dividing net performance by beginning equity. “Drawdown” is measured on the basis of monthly returns only, and does
not reflect intra-month figures. “Month” is the month of the % Worst Monthly Drawdown.   


9.
“% Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown” is the largest percentage decline in the Net Asset Value per Unit over the history of the pool. This need not be a continuous decline,
but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns. “% Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown” represents the greatest percentage decline from any month-end Net Asset Value per Unit
that occurs without such month-end Net Asset Value per Unit being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent month-end. For example, if the Net Asset Value per Unit of a particular pool declined by $1 in each of January and February, increased by $1 in
March and declined again by $2 in April, a “peak-to-valley drawdown” analysis conducted as of the end of April would consider that “drawdown” to be still continuing and to be $3 in amount, whereas if the Net Asset Value per Unit
had increased by $2 in March, the January-February drawdown would have ended as of the end of February at the $2 level.   


10.
“Period” is the period of the “% Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown.”

THE FUTURES AND FORWARD MARKETS  
Futures and Forward Contracts  Commodity futures contracts in the United States are required to be made on
approved commodity exchanges and call for the future delivery of various commodities at a specified time, place and price. These contractual obligations, depending on whether one is a buyer or a seller, may be satisfied either by taking or making
physical delivery of an approved grade of the particular commodity (or, in the case of some contracts, by cash settlement) or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an equivalent commodity futures contract on the same exchange prior to the
designated date of delivery. Certain futures contracts call for cash settlement rather than settlement by delivery, and the Trust will, in any event, offset virtually all of its futures contracts prior to any actual delivery occurring. 
Currencies may be purchased or sold for future delivery through banks or dealers pursuant to what are commonly referred to as “spot” or
“forward” contracts. Spot contracts settle two days after the trade date; forward contracts have more delayed settlements. Spot and forward contracts are commonly referred to collectively as “cash” contracts. In trading cash
currency contracts for the Trust, banks or dealers act as principals and include their anticipated profit and costs in the prices they quote; such mark-ups are known as “bid-ask” spreads. Brokerage commissions are typically not charged in
cash trading.  
Hedgers and Speculators  The two broad classifications of persons who trade in commodity futures are
“hedgers” and “speculators.” Commercial interests, including farmers, that market or process commodities use the futures markets to a significant extent for hedging. Hedging is a protective procedure designed to minimize losses
that may occur because of price fluctuations, for example, between the time a merchandiser or processor makes a contract to sell a raw or processed commodity and the time he must perform the contract. The commodity markets enable the hedger to shift
the risk of price fluctuations to the speculator. The speculator, unlike the hedger, generally expects neither to deliver nor receive the physical commodity; rather, the speculator risks his or her capital with the hope of making profits from price
fluctuations in commodity futures contracts. Speculators, such as the Trust, rarely take or make delivery of the physical commodity but rather close out their futures positions by entering into offsetting purchases or sales of futures contracts. The
Trust does not anticipate taking or making delivery of any physical commodities.  
Commodity Exchanges  Commodity exchanges provide centralized market facilities for trading in futures contracts
relating to specified commodities. Each of the commodity exchanges in the United States has an associated “clearinghouse.” Once trades made between members of an exchange have been confirmed, the clearinghouse becomes substituted for the
clearing member acting on behalf of each buyer and each seller of contracts traded on the exchange and in effect becomes the other party to the trade. Thereafter, each clearing member firm party to the trade looks only to the clearinghouse for
performance. Clearinghouses do not deal with customers, but only with member firms, and the “guarantee” of performance under open positions provided by the clearinghouse does not run to customers. If a customer’s commodity broker
becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or otherwise defaults on such broker’s obligations to such customer, the customer in question may not receive all amounts owing to such customer in respect of his trading, despite the clearinghouse fully
discharging all of its obligations.  The Advisors retained by the Trust trade on a number of foreign commodity exchanges. Foreign commodity
exchanges differ in certain respects from their United States counterparts and are not subject to regulation by any United States governmental agency. Accordingly, the protections afforded by such regulation are not available to the Trust to the
extent that it trades on such exchanges. In contrast to United States exchanges, many foreign exchanges are “principals’ markets,” where trades remain the liability of the traders involved and the there is no clearinghouse to become
substituted for any party. Many foreign exchanges also have no position limits, with each dealer establishing the size of the positions it will permit individual traders to hold.  To the extent that the Trust engages in transactions on foreign exchanges, it is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the
currencies in which the contracts traded on such foreign exchanges are denominated and United States dollars, as well as the possibility that exchange controls could be imposed in the future.

Table of Contents

Speculative Position and Daily Price Fluctuation Limits  The CFTC and the United States exchanges have
established limits, referred to as “speculative position limits,” on the maximum net long or net short position that any person (other than a hedger) may hold or control in futures contracts or options on futures contracts in particular
commodities. The principal purpose of speculative position limits is to prevent a “corner” on the market or undue influence on prices by any single trader or group of traders. A number of financial markets have replaced “position
limits” with “position accountability,” and the cash currency markets are not subject to such limits. However, speculative position limits continue to be applicable in a number of important markets. These limits may restrict an
Advisor’s ability to acquire potentially profitable positions which such Advisor otherwise would acquire on behalf of the Trust.  Most
United States exchanges limit by regulations the maximum permissible fluctuation in commodity futures contract prices during a single trading day. These regulations establish what are commonly referred to as “daily limits.” Daily limits
restrict the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s settlement price. Because these limits apply on a day-to-day basis, they do not limit ultimate losses, but may reduce or
eliminate liquidity. Daily limits are generally not applicable to currency futures or to forward contracts.  
Margins  Margins represent a security deposit to assure futures traders’ performance under their open
positions. When a position is established, “margin” is deposited and at the close of each trading day “variation margin” is either credited or debited from a trader’s account, representing the unrealized gain or loss on open
positions during the day. If “variation margin” payments cause a trader’s “margin” to fall below “maintenance margin” levels, a “margin call” will be made requiring the trader to deposit additional margin
or have his position closed out.  
INVESTMENT FACTORS  
Investment Factors  Managed Futures is a sector of the futures industry made up of professionals, or commodity
trading advisors (CTAs), who on behalf of their clients manage portfolios made up of futures and forward contracts and related instruments traded around the world. Utilizing extensive resources, markets can be accessed and monitored around the
world, 24 hours a day.  For over 20 years institutions and individuals have made Managed Futures part of their well-diversified portfolios.
In that time period, the industry has grown to approximately $86 billion in assets under management.*  As the industry has grown, so has the number,
liquidity and efficiency of the futures markets globally. Since 1974 the U.S. futures markets have grown from consisting primarily of agricultural contracts to include financial contracts, providing greater diversification and flexibility. The pie
charts below demonstrate this growth of diversity within the futures industry. In 1974 the agricultural sector dominated the trading volume of the industry. By 2004 the agricultural sector represented only 5% of trading while interest rate,
currencies and stock indices contracts represented 91%. These interest rate contracts include contracts on U.S. debt instruments, European debt instruments, and bonds in Asia and Australia.   


*
Managed Futures encompass over 50 markets worldwide, and as a result investors can gain global market exposure in their portfolios as well as add non-financial investments. Thus,
investing in a managed futures fund can be an effective way to globally diversify a portfolio.

 Based on average volume of contracts as of December 2006.    Value of Diversifying  into Managed Futures  Allocating a portion of the risk segment of a portfolio to a managed futures investment, such as the Trust, may add a potentially valuable element
of diversification to a traditionally-structured portfolio. Historically over the long term, the returns recognized on managed futures investments have been non-correlated with the performance of stocks and bonds, suggesting that a successful
managed futures investment may be a valuable complement to a portfolio of stocks and bonds. Diversifying assets among different investments that generate positive but non-correlated returns has the potential to decrease risk without a corresponding
decrease in returns—enhancing the risk/reward profile and overall “efficiency” of a portfolio. Non-correlation is not negative correlation. The performance of the Trust is anticipated to be generally unrelated, but may frequently
be similar, to the performance of the general equity markets.    The following discussion and charts, which
include the Barclay CTA Index, are intended to explain managed futures as an asset category, and to demonstrate the potential value of allocating a small portion of a portfolio to a managed futures investment, such as the Trust. The Barclay CTA
Index is utilized as a broad measure of overall managed futures returns, as compared to other indices that measure the overall returns of stocks and bonds as separate asset classes. The Barclay CTA Index is not the same as an investment in the
Trust, and the Trust may perform quite differently than the Index, just as an individual stock may perform quite differently from the S&P 500 Index.  The black area of the chart below shows the benefit of adding 10% Barclay CTA Index (Managed Futures) to a hypothetical portfolio made up of 60% S&P 500 (US Stocks) and 40% Lehman Gov’t (US Bonds), assuming
an initial investment of $1,000. The combined portfolio showed improved returns over the last twenty-two years and lower volatility (a common measure of risk) than a portfolio made up of stocks and bonds alone.

is represented by the S&P 500 Index and the “Bonds” portion by the Lehman Brothers Government Corporate Bond Index. These are passive indices of equity and debt securities that are generally purchased by investors with an investment
objective of capital preservation, growth or income.  Barclay CTA Index* (Managed Futures) – The Barclay CTA Index is a leading industry
benchmark of representative performance of commodity trading advisors. There are currently 492 programs included in the calculation of the Barclay CTA Index for the year 2008, which is unweighted and rebalanced at the beginning of each year. To
qualify for inclusion in the CTA Index, an advisor must have four years of prior performance history. Additional programs introduced by qualified advisors are not added to the Index until after their second year. These restrictions, which offset the
high turnover rates of trading advisors as well as their artificially high short-term performance records, ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Barclay CTA Index. The current year of performance for the Barclay CTA Index is estimated.
Performance is finalized after year-end. (Source: Barclay’s Website).  The performance for all indices was calculated using compounded
monthly returns. A prospective investor is advised that neither the above graph nor the performance tables in this prospectus should be interpreted to mean that the Trust will obtain similar results or generate any profits whatsoever in the future.

provides these benefits to an investor’s overall portfolio:

•
 
 Potential for both reduced volatility and/or enhanced returns;

Table of Contents
Futures and forwards contracts exhibit more risk than stocks or bonds. However, adding a Managed Futures
fund to a stock-and-bond-only portfolio has the potential to reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance returns.  This potential
benefit was initially demonstrated in two key academic works. First, Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by the Nobel Prize Laureate economists Drs. Harry M. Markowitz and William Sharpe, asserts that investments having positive returns and low to
non-correlation with each other can improve the risk/reward characteristics of the combined holdings. In other words, a portfolio of different investments with positive returns independent of each other (i.e. non-correlated) can improve the
risk profile of an investor’s entire portfolio.  Modern Portfolio Theory suggests that a portfolio manager should diversify into asset
categories that have little or no correlation with the other asset categories in the portfolio. The Nobel Prize for Economics in 1990 was awarded to Dr. Harry Markowitz for demonstrating that the total return can increase, and/or risks can be
reduced, when portfolios have positively performing asset categories that are essentially non-correlated. Even an investor who diversifies into international stocks and bonds may not obtain enough non-correlation. Over time, alternative investment
classes such as real estate and international stocks and bonds may correlate closely with domestic equities as the global economy expands and contracts. The logical question that then arises is: “What investment can add value to a portfolio by
enhancing returns and reducing portfolio volatility?”  Historically, managed futures investments have had very little correlation to
the stock and bond markets. The Managing Owner believes that the performance of the Trust should also exhibit a substantial degree of non-correlation (not, however, necessarily negative correlation) with the performance of traditional equity and
debt portfolio components. Unlike short selling in the securities markets, selling futures short is no more difficult than establishing a long position. The profit and loss potential of futures trading is not dependent upon economic prosperity or
interest rate or currency stability. Diversifying assets among different investments that generate positive but non-correlated returns has the potential to decrease risk without a corresponding decrease in returns — enhancing the reward/risk
profile of a portfolio, as demonstrated in the graphs below. Non-correlation will not provide any diversification advantages unless the non-correlated assets are outperforming other portfolio assets, and there is no guarantee that the Trust will
outperform other sectors of the portfolio (or not produce losses). Additionally, although adding managed futures funds to a portfolio may provide diversification, managed futures funds are not a hedging mechanism and there is no guarantee that
managed futures funds will appreciate during periods of inflation or stock and bond market declines.  [Remainder of page left blank

 Non-correlation is not negative correlation. The performance of a Managed Futures investment such as the Trust can
be anticipated to be generally unrelated, but may frequently be similar, to the performance of the general equity and debt markets.

See “Notes To Comparative Performance And Correlation Charts” at the end of this section.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  Correlation
is a statistical measure of the degree to which two variables are related. It is expressed as a number between -1 and 1, with a negative number implying the variables tend to move in opposite directions, while a positive number implies the variables
move in the same direction.  Non-correlated performance is not negatively correlated performance. Managing Owner has no expectation that
the performance of the Trust will be inversely related to that of the general debt and equity markets, i.e., likely to be profitable when the latter are unprofitable or vice-versa. Non-correlation means only that the performance of the
Trust has, in Managing Owner’s judgment, a substantial likelihood of being unrelated to the performance of equities and debt instruments, reflecting Managing Owner’s belief that certain factors which affect equity and debt prices may
affect the Trust differently and that certain factors which affect the former may not affect the latter. The Net Asset Value per Unit may decline or increase more or less than equity and debt instruments during both bear and bull markets.
 In his landmark study, Dr. John Lintner of Harvard University was the first of many to demonstrate specifically that adding a Managed
Futures component to a portfolio can enhance returns.  Dr. Lintner concluded
that a portfolio of judicious investments in stocks, bonds and Managed Futures “. . . show(s) substantially less risk at every possible level of expected return than portfolios of stocks (or stocks and bonds) alone.”(1)  This diversification effect of Managed Futures
is also demonstrated by looking at the performance of Managed Futures compared to that of U.S. stocks, U.S. bonds and international stocks during a major decline. When measured against a decline in the stock and bond markets, Managed Futures has the
ability to provide portfolio diversification due to its non-correlation to stocks and bonds. This does not mean that the returns of Managed Futures are negatively correlated (i.e. perform opposite) to those of stocks and bonds.  Although adding a Managed Futures investment such as the Trust may provide diversification to a portfolio, the Trust is not a hedging mechanism; there
is no guarantee the Trust will appreciate during periods of stock market declines. In addition, the performance of a Managed Futures investment such as the Trust can be anticipated to be generally unrelated, but may frequently be similar to the
performance of general equity markets.

 PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  The Trust offers investors the potential to earn significant profits over time, although not without significant risk.  The Trust offers the potential for diversification from traditional investments. Investors have the opportunity to participate in a large number of
global markets and sectors that are typically not represented in traditional portfolios, and which offer potential profit (or loss) in both rising and falling markets.  Managed futures investments may perform differently than stocks and bonds. In addition, different types of alternative investments are frequently non-correlated with each other. This creates the potential to assemble
a combination of alternative investments able to profit in different economic cycles and international markets, while reducing the portfolio concentration of traditional long equity and debt holdings. (Non-correlation is not negative correlation;
managed futures’ performance is not expected to be generally opposite, but rather unrelated, to stocks and bonds.)  [Remainder of page

  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  Notes to Comparative Performance  and Correlation Charts  S&P 500* (U.S. Stocks) – The S&P 500 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index of

There are currently 396 programs included in the calculation of the Barclay CTA Index for the year 2005, which is unweighted and rebalanced at the beginning of each year.  To qualify for inclusion in the CTA Index, an advisor must have four years of prior performance history. Additional programs introduced by qualified advisors are not added to the Index until after their second year.
These restrictions, which offset the high turnover rates of trading advisors as well as their artificially high short-term performance records, ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Barclay CTA Index. The current year of performance for the
Barclay CTA Index is estimated. Performance is finalized after year-end.  Standard Deviation – Standard Deviation measures the dispersal or
uncertainty in investment returns. It measures the degree of variation of returns around the mean (average) return. The higher the volatility of the investment returns, the higher the standard deviation will be. For this reason, standard deviation
is often used as a measure of investment risk.  Maximum Drawdown – Maximum Drawdown is any losing period during an investment record. The
maximum drawdown is the largest percentage drawdown that has occurred in any investment data record.

Investors should be aware that stocks, bonds and managed futures are very different types of investments, each
involving different investment considerations and risks, including but not limited to liquidity, safety, guarantees, insurance, fluctuation of principal and/or return, tax features, leverage and volatility.  For example, trading in futures, forwards and options may involve a greater degree of risk than investing in stocks and bonds due to, among other things, a greater
degree of leverage and volatility. Also, U.S. government bonds are guaranteed by the U.S. government and, if held to maturity, offer both a fixed rate of interest and return of principal.  
Additional Advantages of Managed Futures Investments  100% Interest Credit. Unlike some
“alternative investment” funds, the Trust will not be required to borrow money in order to obtain the leverage used in its trading strategy. Accordingly, the Trust does not anticipate that it will incur any interest expense. The
Trust’s margin deposits will be maintained in cash equivalents, such as U.S. Treasury bills. Interest is earned on 100% of the Trust’s available assets (which include unrealized profits credited to the Trust’s accounts). 
Liquidity. In most cases the underlying markets have liquidity. Some markets trade 24 hours on business days. There can be exceptional cases
where there may be no buyer or seller for a particular market. However, one of the selection criteria for a market to be included in the Trust is good liquidity, and historically “lock limit” situations have not been common. Investors may
redeem all or a portion of their Units on a monthly basis —beginning with the end of the first month following purchase of such Units — subject to a declining redemption fee during the first twelve months of ownership.  Convenience. The Trust provides a convenient means to participate in global markets and opportunities without the time required to master complex
trading strategies and monitor multiple international markets.  Limited Liability. The liability of investors in the Trust is
limited to the amount of their investment in the Trust. Unitholders will never be required to contribute additional capital to the Trust.  Profit potential in any market environment. With stocks and bonds, investors typically buy securities that they believe will increase in value, and they may have no strategy when markets fall. Futures contracts, on the other hand,
can be easily sold short on the prospect that a market will go down. As a result, declining markets represent opportunities for Managed Futures.  Access to global financial and non-financial markets. Finally, over the years the futures markets have expanded globally to include investments in stock indices and bonds, currencies, precious and base metals, agricultural products
and so forth. Investors can gain access to over 50 financial and non-financial markets around the globe.  
Small Minimum Investment; Smaller Minimum Additional Investment  Many of the Advisors are only available to
manage individual accounts of substantial size ranging from $500,000 to $5,000,000. Investors in the Trust are able to gain access to each of these Advisors, and to the diversification benefits of placing assets with all of them, for a minimum
investment of $5,000 (or $2,000 in the case of trustees or custodians of eligible employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts). Existing Unitholders making additional investments may do so in minimums of $2,000.  [Remainder of page left blank intentionally.]

Eagle Trading Systems Inc.  Eagle Momentum Program  The Eagle Momentum Program is a computerized, technical trading system developed to capture short and intermediate term trading opportunities in markets
that exhibit strong price momentum. The adoption of the trading philosophy to a computerized trading system was done by applying rule-based techniques to confirm the trading concept over an extensive body of historical market data and by constantly
monitoring and reevaluating the rules in actual trading. The program currently covers 30 commodities, currencies, stock indices and global fixed income markets.  Eagle was founded in May 1993 and has managed customer assets since August 1993. The firm has developed various trading programs, and managed a total of approximately $2.5 billion (including “notional”
equity) assets as of February 29, 2008. The program selected for WMT-III first began trading customer assets in October 2003, but traded its proprietary assets in the same program from February 2001 to September 2003. Eagle manages
approximately $55 million (including “notional” equity) in the program selected for Series J as of February 29, 2008.  Pro-forma performance of Eagle Momentum Program (to be traded on behalf of Series J) is presented below.

Ortus Capital Management Limited  Major Currency Program  Ortus Major Currency Program is a systematic investment strategy in major currencies. It is designed to take advantage of the opportunities available as
various currencies and their underlying economies go through different “cycles”. Ortus believes that the key to exploiting such cycles lies in the ability to systematically quantify the dynamic interactions between asset prices and
underlying economic fundamentals. Ortus’ models are based on applications of dynamic equilibrium theory and are calibrated against current market conditions. The portfolio at any given time is computed by Ortus’ portfolio optimization and
risk management programmes. The investment process is systematic, dynamic, and continuous.  Ortus Major Currency Program began trading
customer assets in September 2003. As of February 29, 2008, assets under management in all programs was a total of approximately $1.787 billion (including “notional” equity). Ortus manages approximately $1.772 billion (including
“notional” equity) in the program selected for Series J as of February 29, 2008.  Pro-forma performance of Ortus Major
Currency Program is presented below.

(A) PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ARE ONLY AN APPROXIMATE MEANS OF MODIFYING HISTORICAL RECORDS TO REFLECT ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMIC TERMS OF A NEW COMMODITY ACCOUNT, CONSTITUTE NO MORE THAN ECONOMIC TERMS OF A NEW COMMODITY ACCOUNT, CONSTITUTE NO MORE
THAN MATHEMATICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ACTUAL PERFORMANCE NUMBERS, AND GIVE NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER TO SUCH FACTORS AS POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TRADING APPROACH THAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENT FEE STRUCTURE, INTEREST INCOME, LEVERAGE, AND OTHER
FACTORS APPLICABLE TO A NEW COMMODITY ACCOUNT AS COMPARED TO EAGLE’S ACTUAL PROPRIETARY TRADING; AND (B) THERE ARE DIFFERENT MEANS BY WHICH THE PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE. WHILE EAGLE BELIEVES THAT THE INFORMATION HEREIN IS
RELEVANT TO EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT BY A CLIENT, NO REPRESENTATION IS OR COULD BE MADE THAT THE CAPSULE HEREIN PRESENTS WHAT THE RESULTS OF EAGLE’S ACTUAL PROPRIETARY TRADING WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST OR ARE LIKELY TO BE IN THE FUTURE.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Managing Owner and Unitholders of  World Monitor Trust III – Series J  We have audited the accompanying
statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments, of World Monitor Trust III – Series J (the “Series”) as of December 31, 2007, and the related statements of operations and changes in
unitholder’s capital and financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Series’ management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Series is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Series’ internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Series’ internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of World Monitor Trust III – Series J at December 31, 2007, and the results of its operations and changes in its unitholder’s capital and
the financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Eisner LLP  New York, New York  April 28, 2008

WORLD MONITOR TRUST III – SERIES J  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1. ORGANIZATION   


 
A.
General Description of the Trust  World Monitor Trust III
(the “Trust”) is a business trust organized under the laws of Delaware on September 28, 2004. The Trust consisted of four separate and distinct series (“Series”): Series G, H, I and J. Series G, H, I and J commenced trading
operations on December 1, 2005. Effective March 31, 2007, Series H and Series I were no longer offered and on April 30, 2007 Series H and Series I were dissolved. Effective December 31, 2007, Series G was also no longer offered
and on December 31, 2007 Series G was dissolved. Series J will continue to exist unless terminated at some future date pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII of the Trust’s Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust
Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”). The assets of each Series have been segregated from those of the other Series, separately valued and independently managed, and separate financial statements are prepared for each Series. Each Series was
formed to engage in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward and options contracts and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions.  Each Series is initially divided into two classes: Class I Units and Class II Units. The Class I and Class II Units are identical except for the
applicable service fee charged to each Class.  Effective December 1, 2005, Series J allocated its net assets equally to WMT III Series
G/J Trading Vehicle LLC (whose sole members are Series G and Series J) (the “Company”), WMT III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC (whose sole members were Series H, Series J and Futures Strategic Trust) and WMT III Series I/J Trading Vehicle
LLC (whose sole members were Series I and Series J) (all three of which are collectively, the “Trading Vehicles”) and received a Voting Membership Interest in each Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicles were each formed to function as an
aggregate trading vehicle. Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. (“Preferred” or the “Managing Owner”) is the Managing Owner of the Trust, of each Series and of Futures Strategic Trust, and has been delegated administrative
authority over the operations of the Trading Vehicles. The Trading Vehicles were established for the speculative trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts.  On April 30, 2007, WMT III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC and WMT III Series I/J Trading Vehicle LLC (collectively, the “Terminated Trading
Vehicles”) liquidated and ceased trading operations, leaving the Company as the only remaining trading vehicle investment for Series J. Effective May 1, 2007, Series J re-allocated assets previously held in the Terminated Trading Vehicles
to managed accounts in the name of Series J. The assets that Series J allocated to WMT III Series I/J Trading Vehicle LLC were re-allocated to a managed account to be managed by Eagle Trading Systems Inc. (“Eagle”) pursuant to its Momentum
Program. The assets that Series J allocated to WMT III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC were re-allocated to a managed account managed by Ortus Capital Management Limited (“Ortus”) pursuant to its Major Currency Program.  Effective December 31, 2007, the Company, in conjunction with Series G, was dissolved. Following the Company’s liquidation, Series J
re-allocated its assets to a managed account (collectively with the Eagle and Ortus managed accounts, the “Managed Accounts”) to be managed by the Company’s trading advisor, Graham Capital Management, L.P. (“Graham”)
pursuant to its Global Diversified Program at 150% Leverage.

Benefit Plan Investors (including IRAs)), although the minimum purchase for any single Series is $500.  Initially, the Units for each Series
were offered for a period ending November 30, 2005 (“Initial Offering Period”) at $100 per Interest. The Subscription Minimum of $30,000,000 for Series J was reached during the Initial Offering Period permitting all Series G, H, I and
J to commence trading operations. Series J completed its initial offering on December 1, 2005 with gross proceeds of $31,024,443, which was fully allocated to the Trading Vehicles. Series H and I Units were fully redeemed as of April 30,

series of the Trust (Series G, H, I and J) were permitted to be exchanged, without any charge, for Units of one or more other Series on a monthly basis for as long as Units in those Series were being offered to the public. Exchanges were made at the
applicable Series’ then current net asset value per Unit as of the close of business on the last day of the month in which the exchange request was effected. The exchange of Units was treated as redemption of Units in one Series (with the
related tax consequences) and the simultaneous purchase of Units in the other Series. Following Series H and I’s liquidations on April 30, 2007 and Series G’s liquidation on December 31, 2007, Series J unitholders are no longer
able to effect exchanges from Series J into Series G, H or I.

D.
Exchanges, Redemptions and Termination (Continued)   
Redemptions from Series J are permitted on a monthly basis. Class I Units redeemed prior to the first
anniversary of their purchase will be subject to a redemption charge of up to 2% of the net asset value per Unit at which they were redeemed. Redemption fees are paid to the Selling Agent, Kenmar Securities, Inc. There is no redemption charge
associated with the Class II Units.  In the event that the net asset value of a Series, after adjustments for distributions, contributions
and redemptions, declines by 50% or more since the commencement of trading activities or the first day of a fiscal year, the Series will automatically terminate. In addition, in the event that the net asset value of the Allocated Assets, after
adjustments for distributions, contributions and redemptions, for the managed accounts traded by either Ortus, Eagle or Graham declines by 40% or more since the commencement of trading activities or the first day of a fiscal year, that managed
account will automatically terminate.   


 
E.
Foreign Currency Transactions  Series J’s functional
currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of
the statements of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S.
dollars are reported in operations currently under the caption Realized in the statements of operations.  Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting  The financial statements of Series J
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Such principles require the Managing Owner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Commodity futures and forward transactions are reflected in the accompanying statements of financial condition on a trade date basis. Net unrealized gain
or loss on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) is reflected in the statement of financial condition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 39
– “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” The market value of each contract is based upon the closing quotation on the exchange, clearing firm or bank on, or through, which the contract is traded. Any change in net
unrealized gain or loss during the current period is reported in the statement of operations. Realized gains and losses on commodity transactions are recognized in the period in which the contracts are closed. Brokerage commissions paid directly to
brokers are reflected as “brokerage commissions” in the statement of operations, include exchange and other trading fees, and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
The weighted average number of Units outstanding was computed for purposes of disclosing net income
(loss) per weighted average Unit. The weighted average Units are equal to the number of Units outstanding at period end, adjusted proportionately for Units subscribed and redeemed based on their respective time outstanding during such period.
 Series J has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 102, “Statement of Cash Flows – Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale.”  Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, Series J has provided general indemnifications to the Managing Owner, and
others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of Series J. Series J is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but expects the
risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.  The SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 108
(“SAB 108”), “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”, provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of unrecorded misstatements.
It is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2006. Preferred as Managing Owner of Series J has evaluated the impact, if any, the implementation of SAB 108 may have on its financial statements. In Preferred’s
opinion, no material unrecorded misstatements are in existence as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.  In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that
Series J recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, Series J has elected an accounting
policy to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense. Preferred, as Managing Owner of Series J, evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 48 on Series J’s financial statements. In Preferred’s
opinion, FIN 48 had no material impact on Series J, as Series J’s tax position is based on established tax precedence for the tax treatment of investment partnerships as flow through tax entities.  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 (“SFAS 157”), “Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS 157 requires use of a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1), inputs other than quoted market prices that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2), and unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (Level 3). SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
Series J adopted SFAS 157 in the first quarter of 2008. Preferred, as Managing Owner of Series J,
evaluated the impact adoption of SFAS 157 will have on Series J’s financial statements. Based on an analysis by Preferred, the effect of applying SFAS 157 to the investment portfolio included in these financial statements will not result in a
change to the fair value of Series J’s investments. Of its unrealized gains, approximately $164,692 or 0.21% of Series J’s unitholders’ capital at December 31, 2007 is classified as Level 1 and $0 or 0.00% are Levels 2 or 3, and
of its unrealized losses, approximately $0 or 0.00% are Level 1, $452,149 or 0.57% are Level 2 and $0 or 0.00% are Level 3 using the fair value hierarchy of SFAS 157.  In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, including an amendment of SFAS 115, or SFAS 159. This statement provides companies
with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with early adoption permitted.  Series J adopted SFAS 159 in the first quarter of 2008. Preferred, as Managing Owner of Series J, evaluated the impact adoption of SFAS 159 will have on
Series J’s financial statements. In Preferred’s opinion, the adoption of SFAS 159 had no material effect on Series J’s financial statements.  Cash represents amounts deposited with clearing brokers and banks, a portion of which are restricted for purposes of meeting margin requirements, which typically range from 0% to 35% of the notional amounts of the
derivatives traded. Series J receives interest on all cash balances held by the clearing brokers at prevailing rates.   


 
B.
Income Taxes  Series J is treated as a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes. As such, Series J is not required to provide for, or pay, any Federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the individual Unitholders including the Managing
Owner. Series J may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
C.
Investments in Trading Vehicles  The investments in the
Trading Vehicles are reported in Series J’s statement of financial condition at fair value. Fair value ordinarily is the value determined for the Trading Vehicles in accordance with the Trading Vehicles’ valuation policies and reported at
the time of Series J’s valuation by the management of the Trading Vehicles. Generally, the fair value of Series J’s investment in a Trading Vehicle represents the amount that Series J could reasonably expect to receive from the Trading
Vehicle if Series J’s investment were redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available at the time the valuation was made and that Series J believes to be reliable. Series J records its proportionate share of each item of
income and expense from the investment in the Trading Vehicles in the statement of operations. Through its investment in the Trading Vehicles, Series J paid its proportionate share of annual management fees (2.5%, 3.0% and 2.0% for Trading Vehicles
G/J, H/J and I/J, respectively) and incentive fees (20% of New High Net Trading Profits as defined in the Advisory Agreements for the Trading Vehicles). Incentive fees were accrued monthly and paid quarterly in arrears. The accounting policies,
including valuation policies, of the Trading Vehicles are contained in the notes to each Trading Vehicle’s financial statements included in Sections II, III and IV of these financial statements.   


 
D.
Profit and Loss Allocations and Distributions  Income and
expenses (excluding the service fee) are allocated pro rata to the Class I Units and Class II Units monthly based on the units outstanding during the month. Class I Units are charged with the service fee applicable to such units. Distributions
(other than redemptions of units) may be made at the sole discretion of the Managing Owner on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective capital balances of the unitholders. The Managing Owner has not and does not presently intend to make
any distributions.   


 
E.
Organization and Offering Costs  In accordance with
WMT-III’s Trust Agreement and Prospectus, organization and initial offering costs were paid by the Managing Owner, subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in 36 monthly payments during each of the first 36 months of Series
J’s operations, provided that the Managing Owner shall not be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses in an aggregated amount in excess of 2.5% of the aggregate amount of all subscriptions accepted by Series J during the initial offering
period and the first 36 months of Series J’s operations (the “Continuous Offering Period”). In addition, Series J shall not reimburse the Managing Owner for organization and offering expenses (both initial and ongoing) in excess of
0.50% per annum of Series J’s net asset value. Organization and initial offering costs (exclusive of the initial selling fee), totaling $1,454,441 for all Series of the Trust were paid by the Managing Owner. Series J’s allocable
portion of such costs was $1,384,185 of which $666,370 was reimbursed by Series J to the Managing Owner through December 31, 2007.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
E.
Organization and Offering Costs (Continued)   
The Managing Owner is also responsible for the payment of all offering expenses of Series J incurred
after the Initial Offering Period (“ongoing offering costs”), provided that the amount of such ongoing offering costs paid by the Managing Owner are subject to reimbursement by the Trust, without interest, in up to 36 monthly payments
during each of the first 36 months following the month in which such expenses were paid by the Managing Owner. Through December 31, 2007, the Managing Owner has paid $1,128,310 in ongoing offering costs, of which $1,071,148 has been allocated
to Series J. Ongoing offering cost incurred through November 30, 2006 in the amount of $599,062 will not be reimbursed to the Managing Owner. Through December 31, 2007, no reimbursement has been paid to the Managing Owner for ongoing offering costs
incurred for the period December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 in the amount of $472,085.  Series J will only be liable for payment
of initial and ongoing offering costs on a monthly basis. If a Series terminates prior to completion of payment of such amounts to the Managing Owner, the Managing Owner will not be entitled to any additional payments, and Series J will have no
further obligation to the Managing Owner.  During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the period ended December 31,
2005, Series J’s allocable portion of organization and initial and ongoing offering costs exceeded 0.50% per annum of the Net Asset Value of Series J and, as such, Series J was only liable to the Managing Owner up to the 0.50% per
annum limitation.  For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the period ended December 31, 2005, Series J charged the
amount reimbursable to Preferred for organization and initial offering costs as a charge against capital monthly based upon the limitation discussed above. Moreover, because Series J did not reimburse Preferred for ongoing offering costs, ongoing
offering costs were neither charged against capital nor against expense. Generally accepted accounting principles provide that (a) organization costs should have been expensed as incurred and a liability for their reimbursement recorded,
(b) a liability and deferred asset should have been recorded on December 1, 2005 (date of commencement of investment operations) for the amount of initial offering costs estimated to be reimbursed to Preferred, (c) such deferred asset
should have been amortized to expense over a twelve month period (from the date of commencement of investment operations through November 30, 2006) on a straight line basis, (d) such estimated liability should have been reviewed and
adjusted on a periodic basis through the end of the repayment period for initial offering costs which ends on November 30, 2008, (e) the liability should have been reduced as Series J reimbursed Preferred for initial offering costs and
(f) ongoing offering costs should have been expensed as incurred. Series J has evaluated the difference in accounting methods and concluded that the impact was not material to Series J’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the period ended December 31, 2005.   


 
F.
Interest Income  Interest income is recorded on an accrual
basis. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, interest income consisted of interest earned in the Trading Vehicles and in Series J. During the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005,
interest income included interest earned on subscription monies held in escrow prior to December 1, 2005 in addition to interest income earned in the Trading Vehicles and in Series J.

Note 5. SERVICE FEES AND SALES COMMISSIONS  Series J pays a service fee with respect to Class I Units, monthly in arrears, equal to 1/12 of 2%
(2% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per unit of the outstanding Class I Units as of the beginning of the month. The service fee is paid directly by the Registrant to the Selling Agent, Kenmar Securities, Inc., an affiliate of the Managing Owner.

correspondent selling agent receives an ongoing monthly commission equal to 1/12th of 2% (2% per annum) of the Net Asset Value per Class I Unit as
of the beginning of each month of the Class I Units sold by them.  Class II unitholders are not assessed service fees.  Series J will also pay Kenmar Securities, Inc. a monthly sales commission equal to 1/12th of 1% (1% annually) of the Net Asset Value of the outstanding units as of the beginning of each month.

 * Through April 30, 2007 (date of liquidation) for the H/J Trading Vehicle and the I/J Trading
Vehicle.  Prior to the liquidations of the Trading Vehicles, Series J was able to make additional contributions to, or redemptions from, the
Trading Vehicles on a monthly basis.  Note 9. MARKET AND CREDIT RISK  Series J’s investments in the Trading Vehicles and Managed Accounts are subject to the market and credit risks of the futures contracts, options on futures contracts, forward currency contracts and other
financial instruments held or sold short by them. Series J bears the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of its investment and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.

WORLD MONITOR TRUST III – SERIES J  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 9. MARKET AND CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)   
Series J has cash on deposit with financial institutions and in broker trading accounts. In the event
of a financial institution’s insolvency, recovery of cash on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.  The Managing Owner has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. The Unitholders bear the risk of
loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.  Series J is exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it directly invests through its Managed Accounts. These risks include, but are not limited to, risk
of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of Series J’s investment activities (credit risk).  Market Risk  Trading in futures and
forward contracts (including foreign exchange) involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which is typically many times that of
Series J’s net assets being traded, significantly exceeds Series J’s future cash requirements since Series J intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, Series J is generally subject only to the risk of loss
arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, Series J considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with Series J’s commitments to
purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of the contracts held. However, when Series J enters into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it must make delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then
repurchase the contracts at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities exposes Series J to unlimited risk.  Market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government programs and policies, political and economic events, the level and
volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments Series J holds and the liquidity and inherent volatility of the markets in which Series J trades.

Note 9. MARKET AND CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)   
Credit Risk  When entering into futures or forward contracts, Series J is exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States
and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by their corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by
one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial
institutions. On the other hand, there is concentration risk on forward transactions, entered into by Series J as Series J’s clearing broker, is the sole counterparty. Series J has entered into a master netting agreement with its clearing
broker and, as a result, when applicable, presents unrealized gains and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial condition. The amount at risk associated with counterparty non-performance of all of Series
J’s contracts is the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition; however, counterparty non-performance on only certain of Series J’s contracts may result in greater loss than non-performance on all of Series
J’s contracts. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse will meet its obligations to Series J.  The Managing Owner attempts to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring Series J and its commodity trading advisors to abide by various trading limitations and policies. The Managing Owner monitors compliance with these trading
limitations and policies, which include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties; limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally
limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions.  Series J’s
futures commission merchant, in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to
Series J all assets of Series J relating to domestic futures trading and is not allowed to commingle such assets with its other assets. At December 31, 2007, such segregated assets totaled $51,644,721. Part 30.7 of the CFTC regulations also
requires Series J’s futures commission merchant to secure assets of Series J related to foreign futures trading, which totaled $360,709 at December 31, 2007. There are no segregation requirements for assets related to forward trading.
 As of December 31, 2007, all of Series J’s open futures contracts mature within nine months.

 Total returns are calculated based on the change in value of a unit during the year/period. An
individual unitholders’ total returns and ratios may vary from the above total returns and ratios based on the time of additions and redemptions.   


 (1)
 Net realized and change in unrealized income (loss) per Unit, interest income per Unit, expenses per Unit and offering
costs per Unit are calculated by dividing net realized and change in unrealized income (loss), interest income, expenses and offering costs by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the year/period. Net realized and change in
unrealized income (loss) is a balancing amount necessary to reconcile the change in net asset value per Unit with the other per Unit information. 


 (2)
 Represents interest income less total expenses (exclusive of incentive fees). All components of the net investment loss
ratio have been annualized 


 (3)
 Includes Series J’s proportionate share of income and expenses from WMT III Series H/J, G/J and I/J Trading Vehicle
LLC.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Managing Member and Members of  World Monitor Trust III Series G/J Trading Vehicle LLC  We have audited the
accompanying statement of financial condition, including the condensed schedule of investments, of World Monitor Trust III Series G/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 (date of termination), and the related
statements of operations and changes in members’ capital and financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2007 (date of termination). These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit.  We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of World Monitor Trust III Series G/J Trading Vehicle LLC at December 31, 2007 (date of termination), and the
results of its operations and changes in its members’ capital and the financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2007 (date of termination), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Eisner LLP  New York, New York  April 28, 2008

WMT III SERIES G/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1. ORGANIZATION   


 
A.
General Description of the Trading Vehicle  WMT III Series
G/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Trading Vehicle”) was a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on March 10, 2005, which was scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2054 unless terminated sooner under
the provisions of the Organization Agreement. The Trading Vehicle commenced trading operations on December 1, 2005 and was dissolved effective December 31, 2007. The Trading Vehicle was formed to engage in the speculative trading of a
diversified portfolio of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward currency contracts. Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. (“Preferred” or the “Managing Member”) was the Managing Member of the
Trading Vehicle.  Prior to December 31, 2007, the Trading Vehicle consisted of four members: World Monitor Trust III – Series G,
Class I (“Member G-Class I”), World Monitor Trust III – Series G, Class II (“Member G-Class II”), World Monitor Trust III – Series J, Class I (“Member J-Class I”) and World Monitor Trust
III – Series J, Class II (“Member J-Class II”) (collectively, the “Members”). Preferred is also the Managing Owner of each of the Members. Upon making the initial capital contribution, each Member received
Voting Membership Interests.  Effective December 31, 2007, the Members withdrew from the Trading Vehicle. Member G-Class I and Member
G-Class II were dissolved at this time. Member J-Class I and Member J-Class II re-allocated its assets to a Managed Account to be managed by the Trading Vehicle’s trading advisor, Graham Capital Management, L.P. (the “Trading
Advisor”) pursuant to its Global Diversified Program at 150% Leverage.  The Trading Vehicle was a Member managed limited liability
company that was not registered in any capacity with, or subject directly to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.   


 
B.
The Trading Advisor  Through December 31, 2007, the
Trading Vehicle had an advisory agreement with the Trading Advisor to make the trading decisions for the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Advisor managed approximately 100% of the assets of the Trading Vehicle pursuant to its Global Diversified at 150%
Leverage program.  Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting  The financial statements of the
Trading Vehicle are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require of the Managing Member to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

WMT III SERIES G/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
Commodity futures and forward transactions are reflected in the accompanying statement of financial
condition on a trade date basis. Net unrealized gain or loss on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) is reflected in the financial statements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation No. 39 – “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is based upon the closing quotation on the various futures exchanges
on which the contract is traded. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot price. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss during the current period is reported in the statement of
operations. Realized gains and losses on commodity transactions are recognized in the period in which the contracts are closed.  Brokerage
commissions include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.  The Trading Vehicle has elected not to provide
a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 102, “Statement of Cash Flows – Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain
Securities Acquired for Resale.”  Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Trading Vehicle had
provided general indemnifications to its Trading Advisor and others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicle was unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments
that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but expected the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.  The SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 (“SAB 108”), “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”, provides guidance on quantifying and evaluating the materiality of unrecorded misstatements. It is effective for the first annual period ending after November 15, 2006. Preferred as
Managing Member of the Trading Vehicle has evaluated the impact, if any, the implementation of SAB 108 may have on its financial statements. In Preferred’s opinion, no material unrecorded misstatements are in existence as of December 31,
2007 (date of termination) and 2006 that would require a cumulative effect adjustment to the financial statements.  In July 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48
requires that the Trading Vehicle recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, the Trading
Vehicle had elected an accounting policy to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense. Preferred, as Managing Member of the Trading Vehicle, evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Trading
Vehicle’s financial statements. In Preferred’s opinion, FIN 48 had no material impact on the Trading Vehicle, as the Trading Vehicle’s tax position is based on established tax precedence for the tax treatment of investment
partnerships as flow through tax entities.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 (“SFAS 157”), “Fair
Value Measurements”. SFAS 157 requires use of a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels: quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
(Level 1), inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2), and unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (Level 3). SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Given the Trading Vehicle’s termination on December 31, 2007, SFAS 157 had no impact on the Trading Vehicle’s financial statements.  In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, including an
amendment of SFAS 115, or SFAS 159. This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with early
adoption permitted. Given the Trading Vehicle’s termination on December 31, 2007, SFAS 159 will have no impact on the Trading Vehicle’s financial statements.  Cash represents amounts deposited with a bank and clearing brokers, a portion of which is restricted for purposes of meeting margin requirements, which
typically range from 0% to 35% of the notional amounts of the derivatives traded. The Trading Vehicle received interest on all cash balances held by the bank and clearing brokers at prevailing interest rates.  The Trading Vehicle’s foreign cash balances and US dollar equivalents are the following:

USD (Base) Amount

 The total foreign currency converted to US dollars as a percentage of total cash was 17.18% at
December 31, 2007 (date of termination).   


 
B.
Income Taxes  The Trading Vehicle is treated as a
partnership for Federal income tax purposes. As such, the Trading Vehicle is not required to provide for, or pay, any Federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the Members. The Trading
Vehicle may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operated.   


 
C.
Capital Accounts  The Trading Vehicle accounted for
additions, allocations of net income (loss) and redemptions on a per member capital account basis.

Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
C.
Capital Accounts (Continued)   
The Trading Vehicle allocated profits and losses to its Members monthly on a pro rata basis based on
each Member’s pro rata capital in the Trading Vehicle during the month. Distributions (other than redemptions of capital) were permitted at the sole discretion of the Members on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Members’ respective
capital balances. The Trading Vehicle did not make any distributions.   


 
D.
Foreign Currency Transactions  The Trading Vehicle’s
functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacted business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at
the date of the statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars were translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation
to U.S. dollars are reported in operations currently under the caption Realized in the statements of operations.   


 
E.
Interest Income  Interest income is recorded on an accrual
basis.  Note 3. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES  The Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 of 2.5% (2.5% annually) of the Trading Vehicle’s allocated assets determined as of the close of business on the last day of each month. For purposes of
determining the management fee, any distributions, redemptions or reallocation of assets made as of the last day of each month were added back to the assets and there were no reductions for (i) the management fees calculated or (ii) any
accrued but unpaid incentive fees due the Trading Advisor.  Additionally, the Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor an incentive fee of
20% (the “Incentive Fee”) of “New High Net Trading Profits” (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The incentive fee accrued monthly and was paid quarterly. For the years ended December 31, 2007 (date of
termination), December 31, 2006 and for the period December 1, 2005 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2005, the Trading Advisor earned incentive fees of $955,788, $107,871 and $0, respectively.  Note 4. INCOME TAXES  There have been no differences
between the tax basis and book basis of assets, liabilities or members’ capital since inception of the Trading Vehicle.  Note 5. OPERATING
EXPENSES  Operating expenses of the Trading Vehicle were paid for by the Trading Vehicle.

WMT III SERIES G/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 6. DEPOSITS WITH BROKER  The Trading Vehicle deposited funds with UBS Securities LLC to act as broker subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. The Trading Vehicle also deposited
collateral with UBS AG for margin against over-the-counter forward and foreign exchange deals. Margin requirements were satisfied by the deposit of cash with such broker. The Trading Vehicle earned interest income at competitive rates on assets
deposited with the broker.  Note 7. ADDITIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS  Additional investments in the Trading Vehicle were made monthly subject to the terms of the Organization Agreement.  The Trading Vehicle was not required to make distributions, but could do so at the discretion of the Members. A Member could request and receive
redemption of capital at any time, subject to the terms in the Organization Agreement.  Note 8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS
 The Trading Vehicle was exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it
invested. These risks included, but were not limited to, risk of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the Trading Vehicle’s investment
activities (credit risk).   


 
A.
Market Risk  Trading in futures and forward contracts
(including foreign exchange) involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which was typically many times that of the Trading
Vehicle’s net assets being traded, significantly exceeded the Trading Vehicle’s future cash requirements since the Trading Vehicle intended to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, the Trading Vehicle was generally
subject only to the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, the Trading Vehicle considered the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The
market risk associated with the Trading Vehicle’s commitments to purchase commodities was limited to the gross or face amount of the contract held. However, when the Trading Vehicle entered into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it
had to deliver the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell
commodities exposed the Trading Vehicle to unlimited risk.  Market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government
programs and policies, political and economic events, the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments the Trading Vehicle held and the liquidity and inherent
volatility of the markets in which the Trading Vehicle traded.

Note 8. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS (CONTINUED)   


 
B.
Credit Risk  When entering into futures and forward
contracts, the Trading Vehicle was exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract would not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse
associated with the particular exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by its corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly
reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. On the other hand, there was a
concentration risk on forward transactions entered into by the Trading Vehicle as UBS AG was the sole counterparty. The Trading Vehicle entered into a master netting agreement dated November 29, 2005 with UBS AG and, as a result, when
applicable, presented unrealized gains and losses on open forward positions as a net amount in the statement of financial condition.  The
amount at risk associated with counterparty non-performance of all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts is the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition; however, counterparty non-performance on only certain of the
Trading Vehicle’s contracts may result in greater loss than non-performance on all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts. There could be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse would meet its obligations to the
Trading Vehicle.  The Managing Member attempted to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the Trading Vehicle and its Trading
Advisor to abide by various trading limitations and policies. Preferred monitors compliance with these trading limitations and policies, which include, but are not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties;
limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions.
Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement among the Trading Vehicle, Preferred and the Trading Advisor, the Trading Vehicle shall automatically terminate the Advisory Agreement, if the net asset value allocated to the Trading Advisor declined
as of the end of any business day by at least 40% from the value at the beginning of any calendar year or since the effective date of the Advisory Agreement. The decline in net asset value is after giving effect for distributions, subscriptions and
redemptions.  The Trading Vehicle’s futures commission merchant, in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures
contracts, was required by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Trading Vehicle all assets of the Trading Vehicle relating to domestic futures trading
and was not allowed to commingle such assets with its other assets. At December 31, 2007 (date of termination) and 2006, such segregated assets totaled $9,691,097 and $22,129,652, respectively. Part 30.7 of the CFTC regulations also required
the Trading Vehicle’s futures commission merchant to secure assets of the Trading Vehicle related to foreign futures trading which totaled $4,993,812 and $2,497,027 at December 31, 2007 (date of termination) and 2006, respectively. There
were no segregation requirements for assets related to forward trading.  As of December 31, 2007 (date of termination), all open
futures and forward contracts mature within three months.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Managing Owner and Members of  World Monitor Trust III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC  We have audited the
accompanying statements of financial condition, including the condensed schedules of investments, of World Monitor Trust III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Trading Vehicle”) as of April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and
December 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations and changes in members’ capital for the period from January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and the year ended December 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Trading Vehicle’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trading Vehicle is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trading Vehicle’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of World Monitor Trust III Series H/J Trading Vehicle LLC at April 30, 2007 (Date of
Liquidation) and December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and changes in its members’ capital for the period from January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and the year ended December 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Deloitte & Touche LLP  New York, New York  July 25, 2007

WMT III SERIES H/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1. ORGANIZATION   


 
A.
General Description of the Trading Vehicle  WMT III Series
H/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Trading Vehicle”) was a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on March 10, 2005, which terminated on April 30, 2007 under the provisions of the Trading Vehicle’s
Organization Agreement. The Trading Vehicle commenced trading operations on December 1, 2005. The Trading Vehicle was formed to engage in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures contracts and options on futures contracts.
Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. (“Preferred” or the “Managing Owner”) was the Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicle consisted of five members: World Monitor Trust III – Series H, Class
I (“Member H-Class I”), World Monitor Trust III – Series H, Class II (“Member H-Class II”), World Monitor Trust III – Series J, Class I (“Member J-Class I”), World Monitor Trust III –
Series J, Class II (“Member J-Class II”) and Futures Strategic Trust (collectively, the “Members”). Preferred was also the Managing Owner of each of the Members. Upon making the initial capital contribution, each
Member received Voting Membership Interests.  The Trading Vehicle was a member-managed limited liability company that was not registered in
any capacity with, or subject directly to regulation by, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.   


 
B.
The Trading Advisor  The Trading Vehicle entered into an
advisory agreement with Bridgewater Associates, Inc. (the “Trading Advisor”) to make the trading decisions for the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Advisor managed the assets in the Trading Vehicle pursuant to its Aggressive Pure Alpha
Futures Only – A, No Benchmark program.  Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting  The financial statements of the
Trading Vehicle are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   
-6-  F-47 


Table of Contents
WMT III SERIES H/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
Commodity futures transactions are reflected in the accompanying statement of financial condition on
the trade date. Net unrealized gain or loss on open contracts (difference between contract trade price and market price) is reflected in the financial statements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39
– “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is based upon the closing quotation on the various futures exchanges on which the contract is traded. Any change in net
unrealized gain or loss during the current period is reported in the statement of operations. Realized gains and losses on commodity transactions are recognized in the period in which the contracts are closed.  Brokerage commissions include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.  The Trading Vehicle has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 102, “Statement of Cash Flows – Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale.”  Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Trading Vehicle provided general indemnifications to its Trading Advisor
and others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicle is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future
claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.  In July 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the Trading Vehicle recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the
technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained
earnings.

WMT III SERIES H/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
Preferred as Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle has evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the
Trading Vehicle’s financial statements. In Preferred’s opinion, the adoption of FIN 48 has no material impact on the Trading Vehicle, as the Trading Vehicle’s tax position is based on established tax precedence for the tax treatment
of investment partnerships as flow through tax entities.  In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after the Trading
Vehicle’s liquidation. Given this, Preferred, as Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle, has concluded that SFAS No. 157 has no impact on the Trading Vehicle’s financial statements.   


 
B.
Income Taxes  The Trading Vehicle is treated as a
partnership for Federal income tax purposes. As such, the Trading Vehicle is not required to provide for, or pay, any Federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the Members. The Trading
Vehicle may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.   


 
C.
Capital Accounts  The Trading Vehicle accounted for
additions, allocations of net gain (loss) and redemptions on a per member capital account basis.  The Trading Vehicle allocated profits and
losses to its Members monthly on a pro rata basis based on each Member’s pro rata capital in the Trading Vehicle during the month. Distributions (other than redemptions of capital) were made at the sole discretion of the Members on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the Members’ respective capital balances. The Trading Vehicle had not made any distributions prior to termination.   


 
D.
Foreign Currency Transactions  The Trading Vehicle’s
functional currency was the U.S. dollar; however, it transacted business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in
effect at the date of the statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the
translation to U.S. dollars are reported in operations currently.

Note 3. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES   
The Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 of 3.0% (3.0%
annually) of the Trading Vehicle’s allocated assets determined as of the close of business on the last day of each month. For purposes of determining the management fee, any distributions, redemptions or reallocation of assets made as of the
last day of each month were added back to the assets and there was no reduction for (i) the management fees calculated or (ii) any accrued but unpaid incentive fees due the Trading Advisor.  Additionally, the Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor an incentive fee of 20% (the “Incentive Fee”) of “New High Net Trading
Profits” (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The incentive fee accrued monthly and was paid quarterly. For the period January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and for the year ended December 31, 2006, the
Trading Advisor earned incentive fees of $0 and $237,915, respectively.  Note 4. OPERATING EXPENSES  Operating expenses of the Trading Vehicle were paid for by the Trading Vehicle.  Note 5. DEPOSITS WITH BROKER  The Trading Vehicle deposited funds with UBS Securities LLC to act as
broker subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. Margin requirements were satisfied by the deposit of cash with such broker. The Trading Vehicle earned interest income on assets deposited with the broker at
competitive rates.  Note 6. ADDITIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS  The Trading Vehicle was not required to make distributions, but was permitted to do so at the discretion of the Members. A Member could request and receive redemption of capital at any time, subject to the terms in
the Organization Agreement.  Note 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS  The Trading Vehicle was exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments and related markets in which it invested. These risks
included, but were not limited to, risk of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the Trading Vehicle’s investment activities (credit
risk).

WMT III SERIES H/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 7. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Market Risk  Trading in futures contracts (including
foreign exchange) involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which is typically many times that of the Trading Vehicle’s
net assets being traded, significantly exceeded the Trading Vehicle’s future cash requirements since the Trading Vehicle closed out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, the Trading Vehicle was generally subject only to the risk
of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, the Trading Vehicles considered the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk associated with
the Trading Vehicle’s commitments to purchase commodities was limited to the gross or face amount of the contract held. However, when the Trading Vehicle entered into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it was obligated to make
delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell
commodities exposed the Trading Vehicle to unlimited risk.  Market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government
programs and policies, political and economic events, the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments the Trading Vehicle held and the liquidity and inherent
volatility of the markets in which the Trading Vehicle traded.   


 
B.
Credit Risk  When entering into futures contracts, the
Trading Vehicle was exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with
the particular exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by its corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit
risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. The amount at risk associated with counterparty
non-performance of all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts was the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition; however, counterparty non-performance on only certain of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts might have
resulted in a greater loss than non-performance on all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse can meet its obligations to the Trading Vehicle.

B.
Credit Risk (Continued)   
The Managing Owner attempted to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the Trading
Vehicle and its Trading Advisor to abide by various trading limitations and policies. Preferred monitored compliance with these trading limitations and policies, which included, but was not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with
creditworthy counterparties; limiting the amount of margin or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and
liquidating of positions. Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement among the Trading Vehicle, Preferred and the Trading Advisor, the Trading Vehicle would have automatically terminated the Advisory Agreement, if the net asset value allocated
to the Trading Advisor declined as of the end of any business day by at least 40% from the value at the beginning of any calendar year or since the effective date of the Advisory Agreement. The decline in net asset value was after giving effect for
distributions, subscriptions and redemptions.  The Trading Vehicle’s futures commission merchant, in accepting orders for the purchase
or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Trading Vehicle all assets of the Trading Vehicle relating to domestic futures trading and is not allowed to commingle
such assets with its other assets. At April 30, 2007 (date of liquidation) and December 31, 2006, such segregated assets totaled $19,495,157 and $23,649,869, respectively. Part 30.7 of the CFTC regulations also requires the Trading
Vehicle’s futures commission merchant to secure assets of the Trading Vehicle related to foreign futures trading which totaled $(124) and $136,650 at April 30, 2007 (date of liquidation) and December 31, 2006, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Managing Owner and Members of  World Monitor Trust III Series I/J Trading Vehicle LLC  We have audited the
accompanying statements of financial condition, including the condensed schedules of investments, of World Monitor Trust III Series I/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Trading Vehicle”) as of April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and
December 31, 2006, and the related statements of operations and changes in members’ capital for the period from January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and the year ended December 31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Trading Vehicle’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trading Vehicle is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trading Vehicle’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of World Monitor Trust III Series I/J Trading Vehicle LLC at April 30, 2007 (Date of
Liquidation) and December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and changes in its members’ capital for the period from January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and the year ended December 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Deloitte & Touche LLP  New York, New York  July 25, 2007

WMT III SERIES I/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      Note 1. ORGANIZATION   


 
A.
General Description of the Trading Vehicle  WMT III Series
I/J Trading Vehicle LLC (the “Trading Vehicle”) was a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware on March 10, 2005, which terminated on April 30, 2007 under the provisions of the Trading Vehicle’s
Organization Agreement. The Trading Vehicle commenced trading operations on December 1, 2005. The Trading Vehicle was formed to engage in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures contracts and options on futures contracts.
Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. (“Preferred” or the “Managing Owner”) was the Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicle consisted of three members: World Monitor Trust III – Series I,
Class I (“Member I”), World Monitor Trust III – Series J, Class I (“Member J-Class I”) and World Monitor Trust III – Series J, Class II (“Member J-Class II”) (collectively, the
“Members”). Preferred was also the Managing Owner of each of the Members. Upon making the initial capital contribution, each Member received Voting Membership Interests.  The Trading Vehicle was a member-managed limited liability company that was not registered in any capacity with, or subject directly to regulation by, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) or the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.   


 
B.
The Trading Advisor  The Trading Vehicle entered into an
advisory agreement with Eagle Trading Systems Inc. (the “Trading Advisor”) to make the trading decisions for the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Advisor managed the assets in the Trading Vehicle pursuant to its Momentum program.
 Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting  The financial statements of the
Trading Vehicle are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  Commodity futures transactions are reflected in the accompanying statement of financial condition on the trade date. Net unrealized gain or loss on open
contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) is reflected in the financial statements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 39 – “Offsetting of Amounts Related to
Certain Contracts.” The market value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is based upon the closing quotation on the various futures exchanges on which the contract is traded. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss during the current
period is reported in the statement of operations. Realized gains and losses on commodity transactions are recognized in the period in which the contracts are closed.  Brokerage commissions include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.

Table of Contents
WMT III SERIES I/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
A.
Basis of Accounting (Continued)   
The Trading Vehicle has elected not to provide a Statement of Cash Flows as permitted by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 102, “Statement of Cash Flows – Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classification of Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale.”  Consistent with standard business practices in the normal course of business, the Trading Vehicle provided general indemnifications to its Trading Advisor
and others when they act, in good faith, in the best interests of the Trading Vehicle. The Trading Vehicle is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future
claim, but expects the risk of having to make any payments under these general business indemnifications to be remote.  In July 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires that the Trading Vehicle recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the
technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained
earnings. Preferred as Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle has evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 48 on the Trading Vehicle’s financial statements. In Preferred’s opinion, the adoption of FIN 48 has no material impact on the Trading
Vehicle, as the Trading Vehicle’s tax position is based on established tax precedence for the tax treatment of investment partnerships as flow through tax entities.  In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after the Trading Vehicle’s liquidation. Given this, Preferred, as Managing Owner of the Trading Vehicle, has concluded that SFAS No. 157 has no impact on the
Trading Vehicle’s financial statements.

Table of Contents
WMT III SERIES I/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
B.
Income Taxes  The Trading Vehicle is treated as a
partnership for Federal income tax purposes. As such, the Trading Vehicle is not required to provide for, or pay, any Federal or state income taxes. Income tax attributes that arise from its operations are passed directly to the Members. The Trading
Vehicle may be subject to other state and local taxes in jurisdictions in which it operates.   


 
C.
Capital Accounts  The Trading Vehicle accounted for
additions, allocations of net gain (loss) and redemptions on a per member capital account basis.  The Trading Vehicle allocated profits and
losses to its Members monthly on a pro rata basis based on each Member’s pro rata capital in the Trading Vehicle during the month. Distributions (other than redemptions of capital) could have been made at the sole discretion of the Members on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the Members’ respective capital balances. The Trading Vehicle had not made any distributions prior to termination.   


 
D.
Foreign Currency Transactions  The Trading Vehicle’s
functional currency was the U.S. dollar; however, it transacted business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at
the date of the statement of financial condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation
to U.S. dollars are reported in operations currently.  Note 3. MANAGEMENT AND INCENTIVE FEES  The Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor a monthly management fee equal to 1/12 of 2.0% (2.0% annually) of the Trading Vehicle’s allocated assets
determined as of the close of business on the last day of each month. For purposes of determining the management fee, any distributions, redemptions or reallocation of assets made as of the last day of each month were added back to the assets and
there was no reduction for (i) the management fees calculated or (ii) any accrued but unpaid incentive fees due the Trading Advisor.  Additionally, the Trading Vehicle paid the Trading Advisor an incentive fee of 20% (the “Incentive Fee”) of “New High Net Trading Profits” (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The incentive fee accrued monthly
and was paid quarterly. The Trading Advisor earned incentive fees of $0 and $267,294 for the period January 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007 (Date of Liquidation) and for the year ended December 31, 2006, respectively.  Note 4. OPERATING EXPENSES  Operating expenses of the
Trading Vehicle were paid for by the Trading Vehicle.

Table of Contents
WMT III SERIES I/J TRADING VEHICLE LLC  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)       
Note 5. DEPOSITS WITH BROKER  The Trading Vehicle deposited funds with UBS Securities LLC to act as broker subject to CFTC regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. Margin requirements were satisfied by the deposit of cash with
such broker. The Trading Vehicle earned interest income on assets deposited with the broker at competitive rates.  Note 6. ADDITIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND
REDEMPTIONS  The Trading Vehicle was not required to make distributions, but was permitted to do so at the discretion of the Members. A
Member could have requested and received redemption of capital at any time, subject to the terms in the Organization Agreement.  Note 7. DERIVATIVE
INSTRUMENTS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS  The Trading Vehicle was exposed to various types of risks associated with the derivative instruments
and related markets in which it invested. These risks included, but were not limiteded to, risk of loss from fluctuations in the value of derivative instruments held (market risk) and the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the
Trading Vehicle’s investment activities (credit risk).   


 
A.
Market Risk  Trading in futures contracts (including
foreign exchange) involves entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a specified date and price. The gross or face amount of the contracts, which is typically many times that of the Trading Vehicle’s
net assets being traded, significantly exceeds the Trading Vehicle’s future cash requirements since the Trading Vehicle intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement. As a result, the Trading Vehicle was generally subject only to
the risk of loss arising from the change in the value of the contracts. As such, the Trading Vehicle considered the “fair value” of its derivative instruments to be the net unrealized gain or loss on the contracts. The market risk
associated with the Trading Vehicle’s commitments to purchase commodities is limited to the gross or face amount of the contract held. However, when the Trading Vehicle enters into a contractual commitment to sell commodities, it must make
delivery of the underlying commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell
commodities exposes the Trading Vehicle to unlimited risk.  Market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including government
programs and policies, political and economic events, the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the diversification effect among the derivative instruments the Trading Vehicle held and the liquidity and inherent
volatility of the markets in which the Trading Vehicle traded.

Trading Vehicle was exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations. The counterparty for futures contracts traded on United States and most foreign futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with
the particular exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by its corporate members who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit
risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members (i.e., some foreign exchanges), it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions. The amount at risk associated with counterparty
non-performance of all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts was the net unrealized gain included in the statement of financial condition; however, counterparty non-performance on only certain of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts might have
resulted in greater loss than non-performance on all of the Trading Vehicle’s contracts. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearinghouse would have met it’s obligations to the Trading Vehicle. 
The Managing Owner attempted to minimize both credit and market risks by requiring the Trading Vehicle and its Trading Advisor to abide by various
trading limitations and policies. Preferred monitored compliance with these trading limitations and policies, which included, but were not limited to, executing and clearing all trades with creditworthy counterparties; limiting the amount of margin
or premium required for any one commodity or all commodities combined; and generally limiting transactions to contracts which are traded in sufficient volume to permit the taking and liquidating of positions. Additionally, pursuant to the Advisory
Agreement among the Trading Vehicle, Preferred and the Trading Advisor, the Trading Vehicle shall automatically terminate the Advisory Agreement, if the net asset value allocated to the Trading Advisor declined as of the end of any business day by
at least 40% from the value at the beginning of any calendar year or since the effective date of the Advisory Agreement. The decline in net asset value was after giving effect for distributions, subscriptions and redemptions.  The Trading Vehicle’s futures commission merchant, in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, is required by CFTC
regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Trading Vehicle all assets of the Trading Vehicle relating to domestic futures trading and is not allowed to commingle such assets with its other assets. At April 30, 2007
(date of liquidation) and December 31, 2006, such segregated assets totaled $17,200,304 and $19,166,403, respectively. Part 30.7 of the CFTC regulations also requires the Trading Vehicle’s futures commission merchant to secure assets of
the Trading Vehicle related to foreign futures trading which totaled $1,670,429 and $1,732,473 at April 30, 2007 (date of liquidation) and December 31, 2006, respectively.  As of April 30, 2007 (date of liquidation), all open futures contracts mature in June 2007.

statement based on our audit. The Company has investments in affiliated commodity pools, of which the Company is the Managing Owner, General Partner or Sponsor. The financial statements for certain of these affiliated commodity pools were audited by
other auditors. The value of such investments in affiliated commodity pools audited by other auditors of $1,574,400 at December 31, 2007, is derived from the audited financial statements of such affiliated commodity pools. The reports of the
other auditors have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to these investments, is based solely on the reports of such other auditors.  We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of
financial condition is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of financial condition. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation. We believe that our audit and the reports of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of other auditors, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. as of December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

PREFERRED INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS CORP.  NOTES TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION      Note 1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   


 
A.
General  Preferred Investment Solutions Corp. (the
Company), a Delaware Corporation, is a commodity pool operator registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency of the Unites States (U.S.) government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry. The
Company organizes and operates commodity pools that engage primarily in the speculative trading of futures, forwards and option contracts and receives substantially all of its revenue from the management thereof. It is a member of and subject to the
rules of the National Futures Association (NFA), an industry self-regulatory organization.  The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kenmar Holdings Inc. (the Parent), which in turn, is owned by Kenmar Group, Inc. (KGI). Two of the Company’s officers are each the sole and equal owners of KGI.  The accompanying statement of financial condition is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of certain estimates made by the
Company’s management. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   


 
B.
Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents
include all cash and money market account balances. The Company primarily maintains its cash and cash equivalents with one financial institution. In the event of a financial institution’s insolvency, the Company’s recovery of cash and cash
equivalent balances on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.   


 
C.
Investments in Affiliated Commodity Pools  The
Company’s investments in affiliated commodity pools, of which the Company is the Managing Owner, General Partner or Sponsor, are carried at fair value. Fair value is the value determined for each commodity pool in accordance with such commodity
pool’s valuation policies and, as a general matter, represents the amount that the Company could reasonably expect to receive from the commodity pool if the Company’s investment was redeemed at the date of the statement of financial
condition.   


 
D.
Revenue Recognition  Commission income is recognized when
earned, in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements, and is calculated based on a percentage of assets under management. Incentive fees are recognized in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements and are based on a
percentage of the net profits experienced by the affiliated commodity pools.   


 
E.
Property and Equipment  Depreciation of furniture,
fixtures and office equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 5 to 7 years. Depreciation of software is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
of the software, which is 3 years. Amortization of leased assets and leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets.

Note 1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   


 
F.
Income Taxes  The Company has elected S corporation
status, pursuant to which the Company does not pay U.S. Corporate or state income tax on its taxable income. Instead, the ultimate stockholders of the Company are liable for individual income tax on their share of the Company’s taxable income.
 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) entitled
“Accounting For Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income
tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an entity before being measured and recognized in the financial statements. The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Company’s statement of financial condition.   


 
G.
Goodwill  Goodwill represents costs in excess of the fair
value of the net assets of the companies acquired in a purchase transaction (as discussed in Note 2.). The Company tests for impairment on a quarterly basis based on a review of projected net fees from the underlying commodity pools which the
Company manages as a result of the acquisition.   


 
H.
Offering Costs  The Company, pursuant to World Monitor
Trust III’s (the “Trust”) Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) as managing owner of World Monitor Trust III Series G (“Series G”), World Monitor Trust III
Series H (“Series H”), World Monitor Trust III Series I (“Series I”) and World Monitor Trust III Series J (“ Series J”) (each individually a “Series” and together the “Series”) is responsible for
paying the initial offering costs and the ongoing offering cost associated with each of the Series’. The Company also paid all offering costs incurred after the initial offering period (“ongoing offering costs”).  Both initial and ongoing offering costs are reimbursed to the Company based upon terms described in the Trust Agreement and as agreed upon by the Company
and each Series. In the event a Series terminates prior to reimbursing the Company initial and ongoing offering costs, such terminated Series will not be responsible for any additional reimbursement to the Company and the Company will forego any
remaining reimbursement allocated to such terminated Series. Since there is no certainty as to the amount the Company will be reimbursed, the Company expenses the amounts when they are paid and records the reimbursement as income when received.

I.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement  In September
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. While FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, for some entities, the application of FAS 157 may change
current practice. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The implementation of FAS 157 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Company’s statement of financial condition.  Note 2. GOODWILL  On June 30, 2004, Prudential Securities Group Inc. (PSG) and the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which PSG would sell, and the Company would buy, all of the capital stock of
Prudential Securities Futures Management Inc. (PSFMI) (the then current Managing Owner or Sponsor of 12 commodity pools, namely World Monitor Trust – Series A, World Monitor Trust – Series B, World Monitor Trust II – Series D, World
Monitor Trust II – Series E, World Monitor Trust II – Series F, Futures Strategic Trust, Diversified Futures Trust I, Diversified Futures Trust II, International Futures Fund B PLC, International Futures Fund C PLC, International Futures
Fund D PLC and International Futures Fund F PLC) and Seaport Futures Management, Inc. (Seaport) (the then General Partner of one commodity pool, Diversified Futures Fund L.P.) (collectively, the acquired commodity pools). In connection with the
transaction, PSFMI and Seaport solicited proxies seeking approval from the interestholders of the acquired commodity pools for (i) the sale of the stock of PSFMI and Seaport to the Company; (ii) the concomitant approval of the Company as
the new General Partner, Managing Owner or Sponsor of the acquired commodity pools and (iii) the approval of certain amendments to the Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreements and Agreement of Limited Partnership of the acquired commodity
pools.  As of October 1, 2004, the Company acquired from PSG all of the outstanding stock of PSFMI and Seaport. Immediately after such
acquisition, PSFMI and Seaport were merged with and into the Company. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2004, all of the board of directors and officers of PSFMI and Seaport resigned. Following the Company’s acquisition of PSFMI and Seaport
and their merger with and into the Company, the Company became the successor General Partner, Managing Owner or Sponsor of the acquired commodity pools.

PREFERRED INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS CORP.  NOTES TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION (CONTINUED)       
Note 2. GOODWILL (CONTINUED)   

In consideration for the purchase of the capital stock of PSFMI and Seaport, the Company agreed to
pay to PSG $1,961,755. The Company also incurred legal and accounting expenses directly related to the acquisition. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and as such, the excess of the total purchase price over the estimated fair
value of the acquired net assets has been recorded as goodwill.  In addition to the purchase price noted above, the Company paid a
contingent finder’s fee of 20% of the net fees earned from the management of the acquired commodity pools. This finder’s fee was payable during the period October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2006, at which time the agreement
terminated. Such finder’s fee was treated as a component of the direct cost of the acquisition and increased the amount of goodwill related to the business combination as such amounts were incurred by the Company.  The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2007 are as follows:   








 Goodwill at December 31, 2006
  
$
2,417,656

(600,000
)


  
 
 
 

 Goodwill at December 31, 2007
  
$
1,817,656
 


  
 
 
 
 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. Due to decreasing asset levels of the
acquired commodity pools, projected net fees are expected to be lower. As a result of expected lower net fees, a goodwill impairment loss of $600,000 was recognized as of June 30, 2007, with no further impairment losses recognized as of
December 31, 2007.  No part of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

one with a financial institution and the other with an affiliate of the financial institution on September 20, 2004 and September 29, 2004, respectively. Each loan was originally for $750,000. Both these loans were fully paid in December
2007.  The loans were entered into to provide financing in connection with the Company’s acquisition of two corporations effective
October 1, 2004 as described in Note 2. The loans were repayable on September 27, 2005 and September 29, 2005, respectively, with the Company having the option to extend the repayment date by a further six months. Effective
September 6, 2005, both loan repayment dates were extended to March 31, 2006 and effective February 17, 2006, both loan repayment dates were further extended to December 31, 2006. Effective December 4, 2006, both loan
repayment dates were extended to December 31, 2007. As noted above, these loans were fully repaid in December 2007.  Interest for each
loan consisted of two components. The first interest rate component provided that the Company made a monthly interest payment of 1.25% (15% per annum) on the outstanding loan balance monthly in arrears. The second component provided that interest
accrued on the loan amount outstanding at a rate indexed to 100% of the performance of the Managing Owner or General Partner interests invested in the acquired commodity pools as described in Note 2., which is payable at December 31, 2007.
Total interest payable on the loans as of December 31, 2007 is $23,650.  Amounts outstanding on the loans were secured by the
Company’s General Partner or Managing Owner interests in the respective funds.  Note 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  The Company has transactions and relationships with members of a group of affiliated companies that occasionally result in advances to and from such
affiliates. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company entered into a Services, Space Sharing and Expense Agreement (“Expense Agreement”) with KGI. Per the terms of the Expense Agreement, KGI is responsible for providing Support Services
and Support Personnel (as defined in the agreement) to the Company and its affiliates. KGI, in turn, will charge the appropriate portion of such expenses, at cost to its affiliates, including the Company. The following amounts are due from
affiliates at December 31, 2007:

Note 6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)   
The Company and Kenmar Global Trust (“KGT”), an affiliated commodity pool, entered into a
purchase agreement effective August 10, 2007 whereby Preferred acquired all of KGT’s right, title and interest to an Investment Advisory Agreement dated February 11, 2004 by and between KGT and Sentinel Management Group, Inc.
(“Sentinel”) and KGT’s right, title and interest to KGT’s account managed by Sentinel, including KGT’s rights to the funds in the account as well as all claims related thereto against Sentinel (the “Asset”).
Sentinel is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a future commission merchant registered with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. The purchase price for the Asset was $1,685,193 which represented
the recorded value of KGT’s deposit in the account as reported by Sentinel to KGT at the close of business August 17, 2007, the business day immediately proceeding the day on which Sentinel suspended withdrawals. Sentinel filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection on August 17, 2007 in the Northern District of Illinois. The Company’s potential recovery of the Asset will be determined by the results of the bankruptcy proceedings, which is currently unknown, unless the Company
sells the Asset prior to completion of such bankruptcy proceedings. The potential amount that may be recovered from the bankruptcy proceedings or sale is unknown.  The purchase price was paid for with a secured demand promissory note (the “Note”). The interest rate on the Note is the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (7.25% at December 31, 2007) and resets monthly.
Interest is payable monthly in arrears on the first business day of the month. As of December 31, 2007 $10,650 of interest was payable to KGT and is recorded in Interest Payable on the Statement of Financial Condition.  Any portion of the principal amount, which is not demanded by KGT prior to August 31, 2009, will be due and payable by the Company, with all accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, on August 31, 2009, unless KGT or the Company agree to an extension of the Note. The Note is secured by a Security Agreement whereby the Company granted KGT a first priority interest in the Asset to secure payment
of the Note.  At December 31, 2007, the Company valued the investment with Sentinel at $674,077 which is recorded in Other investment
on the Statement of Financial Condition. This valuation was determined based on available offers from independent third parties to purchase the asset.  Note 7. GUARANTEES  On July 29, 2005, the Company entered into a lease agreement to lease office space effective
January 1, 2006. Effective December 31, 2005, the lease was assigned to the Parent. The lease term is 11 years and expires on December 31, 2016.

 Note 8. INDEMNIFICATIONS  As a Managing Owner, General Partner or Sponsor, the Company may be contingently liable for costs and liabilities incurred by the affiliated commodity pools. In the normal course of business the Company enters into
contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum exposure under those arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be
made against the Company that have not yet occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.

PREFERRED INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS CORP.  NOTES TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION (CONTINUED)       
Note 9. TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RELATED RISKS  The commodity pools in which the Company either serves as Managing Owner, General Partner or Sponsor or invests, engage primarily in the speculative
trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts and forward contracts (collectively, “derivatives”) in U.S. and foreign markets. The commodity pools, and therefore, the Company are exposed to both market risk (the risk arising
from changes in the market value of the contracts) and credit risk (the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract). Theoretically, the commodity pools are exposed to market risk equal to the notional contract
value of futures and forward contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. Additionally, written options expose the commodity pools to potentially unlimited liability and purchased options expose the commodity pools to a
risk of loss limited to the premiums paid. Since forward contracts are traded in unregulated markets between principals, the commodity pools also assume the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance.  The commodity pools have a substantial portion of their assets on deposit with futures commission merchants, brokers and dealers in securities and other
financial institutions in connection with their trading and cash management activities. In the event of a financial institution’s insolvency, recovery of partnership or trust assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other
protection afforded such deposits.  The Company, as Managing Owner, General Partner or Sponsor has established procedures to actively
monitor market risk and to minimize credit risk of its affiliated commodity pools, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so.

 (a) Each of the parties hereto, by entering into this Trust Agreement, (i) expresses its intention that the Units of
each Series will qualify under applicable tax law as interests in a partnership which holds the Trust Estate of each Series for their benefit, (ii) agrees that it will file its own Federal, state and local income, franchise and other tax

Unitholder. Each Unitholder agrees to take any further action as may be required by regulation or otherwise to effectuate such designation. Subject to Section 4.7, each Series hereby indemnifies, to the full extent permitted by law, the
Managing Owner from and against any damages or losses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in carrying out its responsibilities as Tax Matters Partner, provided
such action taken or omitted to be taken does not constitute fraud, negligence or misconduct.  (c) Each Unitholder shall
furnish the Managing Owner and the Trustee with information necessary to enable the Managing Owner to comply with Federal income tax information reporting requirements in respect of such Unitholder’s Units.  SECTION 1.7. General Liability of the Managing Owner.  (a) The Managing Owner shall be liable for the acts, omissions, obligations and expenses of each Series of the Trust, to the extent not
paid out of the assets of the Series, to the same extent the Managing Owner would be so liable if each Series were a partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the Managing Owner were a general partner of such
partnership. The foregoing provision shall not, however, limit the ability of the Managing Owner to limit its liability by contract. The obligations of the Managing Owner under this Section 1.7 shall be evidenced by its ownership of the General
Units which, solely for purposes of the Delaware Trust Statute, will be deemed to

personal liability for any liability or obligation of the Trust or any Series thereof.  SECTION 1.8. Legal Title. Legal title to all
of each Trust Estate shall be vested in the Trust as a separate legal entity; except where applicable law in any jurisdiction requires any part of the Trust Estate to be vested otherwise, the Managing Owner may cause legal title to the Trust Estate
or any portion thereof to be held by or in the name of the Managing Owner or any other Person as nominee.  SECTION 1.9. Series
Trust. The Units of the Trust shall be divided into Series as provided in Section 3806(b)(2) of the Delaware Trust Statute. Accordingly, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Articles IV, V, VII, VIII, IX and X of this Trust Agreement
shall apply also with respect to each such Series as if each such Series were a separate statutory trust under the Delaware Trust Act, and each reference to the term “Trust” in such Articles shall be deemed to be a reference to each Series
separately to the extent necessary to give effect to the foregoing intent, as the context may require. The use of the terms “Trust” or “Series” in this Agreement shall in no event alter the intent of the parties hereto that the
Trust receive the full benefit of the limitation on interseries liability as set forth in Section 3804 of the Delaware Trust Statute.  ARTICLE II  THE TRUSTEE  SECTION 2.1. Term; Resignation.   (a) Wilmington Trust Company has been appointed and

Statute. The Trustee shall have only the rights, obligations and liabilities specifically provided for herein and shall have no implied rights, obligations and liabilities with respect to the business and affairs of the Trust or any Series. The

the Trust, the execution, delivery and performance of any other agreements to which the Trust is a party or the action or inaction of the Trustee hereunder or thereunder, except for Expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Indemnified Parties. The indemnities contained in this Section 2.4 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement or the removal or resignation of the Trustee. The Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification from
any Trust Estate.  SECTION 2.5. Successor Trustee. Upon the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Managing Owner shall appoint
a successor Trustee by delivering a written instrument to the outgoing Trustee. Any successor Trustee must satisfy the requirements of Section 3807 of the Delaware Trust Statute. Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a

General.  (a) The Managing Owner shall have the power and authority, without Limited Owner approval, to issue Units in one or more Series from time to time as it deems necessary or desirable. Each Series shall be separate from all other Series in
respect of the assets and liabilities allocated to that Series and shall represent a separate investment portfolio of the Trust. The Managing Owner shall have exclusive power without the requirement of Limited Owner approval to establish and
designate such separate and distinct Series, as set forth in Section 3.2, and to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences as between the Units of the separate Series as to right of redemption, special and relative rights as to
dividends and other distributions and on liquidation, conversion rights, and conditions under which the Series shall have separate voting rights or no voting rights.  (b) The Managing Owner may, without Limited Owner approval, divide or subdivide Units of any Series into two or more classes or
subclasses, Units of each such class or subclass having such preferences and special or relative rights and privileges (including exchange rights, if any) as the Managing Owner may determine as provided in Section 3.3. The fact that a Series
shall have been initially established and designated without any specific establishment or designation of classes or subclasses, shall not limit the authority of the Managing Owner to divide a Series and establish and designate separate classes or
subclasses thereof.  (c) The number of Units authorized shall be unlimited, and the Units so authorized may be represented
in part by fractional Units, calculated to four decimal places. From time to time, the Managing Owner may divide or combine the Units of any Series or class into a greater or lesser number without thereby changing the proportionate beneficial
interests in the Series or class. The Managing Owner may issue Units of any Series or class thereof for such consideration and on such terms as it may determine (or for no consideration if pursuant to a Unit dividend or split-up), all without action
or approval of the Limited Owners. All Units when so issued on the terms determined by the Managing Owner shall be fully paid and non-assessable. The Managing Owner may classify or reclassify any unissued Units or any Units previously issued and
reacquired of any Series or class thereof into one or more Series or classes thereof that may be established and designated from time to time. The Managing Owner may hold as treasury Units, reissue for such consideration and on such terms as it may
determine, or cancel, at its discretion from time to time, any Units of any Series or class thereof reacquired by the Trust. Unless otherwise determined by the Managing Owner, treasury Units shall not be deemed cancelled. The Units of each Series
shall initially be divided into two classes: General Units and Limited Units. Furthermore, the Limited Units of each Class initially shall be divided into two sub-classes: the Class I Units and the Class II Units. The Class I Units and the Class II
Units shall be identical in every respect except for the service fees applicable to each of them, which service fees shall be as set forth in any applicable selling agent agreement in effect from time-to-time with respect thereto and as described in
the Prospectus.  (d) The Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates will make and maintain a permanent investment in each Series
as more specifically set forth in Section 3.4.  (e) No certificates or other evidence of beneficial ownership of the
Units will be issued.  (f) Every Unitholder, by virtue of having purchased or otherwise acquired a Unit, shall be deemed to
have expressly consented and agreed to be bound by the terms of this Trust Agreement.

of the Trust in the written instrument creating such Series.  (b) The establishment and designation of any Series of Units
other than those set forth above shall be effective upon the execution by the Managing Owner of an instrument setting forth such establishment and designation and the relative rights and preferences of such Series, or as otherwise provided in such

of Classes and Sub-Classes. The division of any Series into two or more classes or sub-classes and the establishment and designation of such classes or sub-classes shall be effective upon the execution by the Managing Owner of an instrument
setting forth such division, and the establishment, designation, and relative rights and preferences of such classes, or as otherwise provided in such instrument. The relative rights and preferences of the classes or sub-classes of any Series may
differ in such respects as the Managing Owner may determine to be appropriate, provided that such differences are set forth in the aforementioned instrument. At any time that there are no Units outstanding of any particular class or sub-class
previously established and designated, the Managing Owner may by an instrument executed by it abolish that class or sub-class and the establishment and designation thereof. Each instrument referred to in this paragraph shall have the status of an
amendment to this Trust Agreement.  SECTION 3.4. Limited Units.  (a) Offer of Series G Limited Units.  (i) Series G Initial Offering Period. During the Initial Offering Period, the Trust shall offer pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 415, at an offering price of $100 per Series G Limited Unit, a

subscribers have been admitted as Limited Owners of Series G Units, as soon as practicable after the termination of the Series G Initial Offering Period. Such accepted subscribers will be deemed Series G Limited Owners at such time as such admission
is reflected on the books and records of Series G of the Trust.

that at least 5,000 Series G Limited Units are sold during the Initial Offering Period, Series G shall have paid-in capital of not less than $525,000 (including the Managing Owner’s contribution for the General Units as provided in

Units. In the event that at least 5,000 Series G Limited Units are not sold during the Initial Offering Period for the Series G Units, all proceeds of the sale of Series G Limited Units, together with any interest earned thereon, will be
returned to the subscribers on a pro rata basis (taking into account the amount and time of deposit), as promptly as practicable but in no even more than seven days after the conclusion of the Initial Offering Period for the Series G Units.
Such action will not terminate Series G.  (v) Required Contribution of Managing Owner. In the event that 5,000 or
more of the Series G Limited Units offered pursuant to the Prospectus are sold during the Initial Offering Period for the Series G Units and 300,000 or more of the Series J Limited Units offered pursuant to the Prospectus are sold during the Initial
Offering Period for the Series J Units, the Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates shall be required to contribute in cash to the capital of Series G an amount, which, when added to the total contributions to Series G by all Series G Unitholders, will
be not less than 1% of such total contributions, and in no event shall such contribution be less than $25,000 (including the Managing Owner’s and/or its Affiliates’ Capital Contributions). Thereafter, the Managing Owner and/or its
Affiliates shall maintain an investment in Series G Units in an aggregate amount equal to not less than 1.01% of the Net Asset Value of Series G or $25,000, whichever is greater. The Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates may, but are not obligated

shall be so recorded upon the books of account of the Trust. Separate and distinct records shall be maintained for each Series and the assets associated with a Series shall be held and accounted for separately from the other assets of the Trust, or
any other Series. In the event that there is any Trust Estate, or any income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, funds, or payments which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular Series, the Managing Owner shall allocate

right of payment to any and all other Claims against the Trust and any Series thereof, and any of their respective assets, which may arise as a matter of law or pursuant to any contract, provided, however, that the Claims of each of
the Managing Owner and the Trustee (if any) against the Applicable Series shall not be considered Subordinated Claims with respect to enforcement against and distribution and repayment from the Applicable Series, the Applicable Series’ assets
and the Managing Owner and its assets; and provided further that the valid Claims of either the Managing Owner or the Trustee, if any, against the Applicable Series shall be pari passu and equal in right of repayment and distribution
with all other valid Claims against the Applicable Series;  (ii) the Managing Owner and the Trustee will not take, demand
or receive from any Series or the Trust or any of their respective assets (other than the Applicable Series, the Applicable Series’ assets and the Managing Owner and its assets) any payment for the Subordinated Claims;  (iii) The Claims of each of the Managing Owner and the Trustee with respect to the Applicable Series shall only be asserted and
enforceable against the Applicable Series, the Applicable Series’ assets and the Managing Owner and its assets; and such Claims shall not be asserted or enforceable for any reason whatsoever against any other Series, the Trust generally, or any
of their respective assets;  (iv) If the Claims of the Managing Owner or the Trustee against the Applicable Series or the
Trust are secured in whole or in part, each of the Managing Owner and the Trustee hereby waives (under section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 1111(b)) any right to have any deficiency Claims (which deficiency Claims may arise in
the event such security is inadequate to satisfy such Claims) treated as unsecured Claims against the Trust or any Series (other than the Applicable Series), as the case may be;  (v) In furtherance of the foregoing, if and to the extent that the Managing Owner and the Trustee receive monies in connection with the
Subordinated Claims from a Series or the Trust (or their respective assets), other than the Applicable Series, the Applicable Series’ assets and the Managing Owner and its assets, the Managing Owner and the Trustee shall be deemed to hold such
monies in trust and shall promptly remit such monies to the Series or

the Trust that paid such amounts for distribution by the Series or the Trust in accordance with the terms hereof; and  (vi) The foregoing Consent shall apply at all times notwithstanding that the Claims are satisfied, and notwithstanding that the
agreements in respect of such Claims are terminated, rescinded or canceled.  (c) Any agreement entered into by the Trust,
any Series, or the Managing Owner, on behalf of the Trust generally or any Series, including, without limitation, the Subscription Agreement entered into with each Unitholder, will include language substantially similar to the language set forth in
Section 3.6(b).  SECTION 3.7. Dividends and Distributions.  (a) Dividends and distributions on Units of a particular Series or any class thereof may be paid with such frequency as the Managing Owner
may determine, which may be daily or otherwise, to the Unitholders in that Series or class, from such of the income and capital gains, accrued or realized, from the Trust Estate belonging to that Series, or in the case of a class, belonging to that
Series and allocable to that class, as the Managing Owner may determine, after providing for actual and accrued liabilities belonging to that Series. All dividends and distributions on Units in a particular Series or class thereof shall be
distributed pro rata to the Unitholders in that Series or class in proportion to the total outstanding Units in that Series or class held by such Unitholders at the date and time of record established for the payment of such dividends or
distribution, except to the extent otherwise required or permitted by the preferences and special or relative rights and privileges of any Series or class. Such dividends and distributions may be made in cash or Units of that Series or class or a
combination thereof as determined by the Managing Owner or pursuant to any program that the Managing Owner may have in effect at the time for the election by each Unitholder of the mode of the making of such dividend or distribution to that
Unitholder.  (b) The Units in a Series or a class of the Trust shall represent units of beneficial interest in the Trust
Estate belonging to such Series or in the case of a class, belonging to such Series and allocable to such class. Each Unitholder in a Series or a class shall be entitled to receive its pro rata share of distributions of income and capital gains made
with respect to such Series or such class. Upon reduction or withdrawal of its Units or indemnification for liabilities incurred by reason of being or having been a holder of Units in a Series or a class, such Unitholder shall be paid solely out of
the funds and property of such Series or in the case of a class, the funds and property of such Series and allocable to such class of the Trust. Upon liquidation or termination of a Series of the Trust, Unitholders in such Series or class shall be
entitled to receive a pro rata share of the Trust Estate belonging to such Series or in the case of a class, belonging to such Series and allocable to such class.  SECTION 3.8. Voting Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, on each matter submitted to a vote of the Unitholders of a Series, each Unitholder shall be entitled to a proportionate vote based upon
the product of the Series Net Asset Value per Unit multiplied by the number of Units, or fraction thereof, standing in its name on the books of such Series. As to any matter which affects the Units of more than one Series, the Unitholders of each
affected Series shall be entitled to vote, and each such Series shall vote as a separate class.  SECTION 3.9. Equality. Except as
provided herein or in the instrument designating and establishing any class or Series, all Units of each particular Series shall represent an equal proportionate beneficial interest in the assets belonging to that Series subject to the liabilities
belonging to that Series, and each Unit of any particular Series or class shall be equal to each other Unit of that Series or class; but the provisions of this sentence shall not restrict any distinctions permissible under Section 3.7 that may
exist with respect to dividends and distributions on Units of the same Series or class. The Managing Owner may from time to time divide or combine the Units of any particular Series or class into a greater or lesser number of Units of that Series or
class without thereby changing the proportionate beneficial interest in the assets belonging to that Series or in any way affecting the rights of Unitholders of any other Series or class.  SECTION 3.10. Exchange of Units. Subject to compliance with the requirements of applicable law, the Managing Owner shall have the authority to
provide that Unitholders of any Series shall have the right to exchange 
  
TA-27

said Units into one or more other Series in accordance with such requirements and procedures as may be established by the Managing Owner. The Managing
Owner shall also have the authority to provide that Unitholders of any class of a particular Series shall have the right to exchange said Units into one or more other classes of that particular Series or any other Series in accordance with
such requirements and procedures as may be established by the Managing Owner.  ARTICLE IV  THE MANAGING OWNER  SECTION 4.1.

provided, however, that in no event shall the fees payable by the Trust for such services exceed any limitations imposed by the NASAA Guidelines, as they may be amended from time-to-time; and provided further, that such
services may be performed by an Affiliate or Affiliates of the Managing Owner so long as the Managing Owner has made a good faith determination that: (A) the Affiliate which it proposes to engage to perform such services is qualified to do so
(considering the prior experience of the Affiliate or the individuals employed thereby); (B) the terms and conditions of the agreement pursuant to which such Affiliate is to perform services for the Trust are no less favorable to the Trust than
could be obtained from equally-qualified unaffiliated third parties; and (C) the maximum period covered by the agreement pursuant to which such affiliate is to perform services for the Trust shall not exceed one year, and such agreement shall
be terminable without penalty upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice by the Trust; and  (ii) (A) commodity

be required to be given by persons who are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and are members of the NFA as a commodity trading advisor) and satisfy the relevant experience requirements under the NASAA guidelines, as they may be
amended from time to time;  (b) To establish, maintain, deposit into, sign checks and/or otherwise draw upon accounts on

Code, or any other applicable Federal or state tax law as the Managing Owner shall determine to be in the best interests of the Trust;  (i) To redeem mandatorily any Limited Units if (i) the Managing Owner determines that the continued participation of such Limited Owner in the Trust might cause the Trust or any Unitholder to be deemed to be
managing the assets of any “employee benefit plan” as defined in and subject to ERISA or “plan” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (ii) there is an unauthorized assignment pursuant to the provisions
of Article V, (iii) any transaction to be entered into by the Trust that would or might violate any law or (iv) any transaction to be entered into by the Trust that would or might constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code
and a statutory, class or individual exemption from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for such transaction or transactions does not apply or cannot be obtained from the DOL (or the Managing Owner
determines not to seek such an exemption). In the case of mandatory redemptions, the Redemption Date shall be the close of business on the date written notice of intent to redeem is sent by the Managing Owner to a Limited Owner. A notice may be
revoked prior to the payment date by written notice from the Managing Owner to a Limited Owner;  (j) In the sole discretion
of the Managing Owner, to admit an Affiliate or Affiliates of the Managing Owner as additional Managing Owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing Owner may not admit Affiliate(s) of the Managing Owner as an additional Managing Owner if it

Owner) is not obtained; and  (k) To override any trading instructions: (i) that the Managing Owner, in its sole
discretion, determines in good faith to be in violation of any trading policy or limitation of the Trust; (ii) as and to the extent necessary, upon the failure of any Trading Advisor to comply with a request to make the necessary amount of

Managing Owner may make Commodities trading decisions at any time at which any Trading Advisor shall become incapacitated or some other emergency shall arise as a result of which such Trading Advisor shall be unable or unwilling to act and a
successor Trading Advisor has not yet been retained.  SECTION 4.3 Obligations of the Managing Owner. In addition to the obligations

therefor, upon payment of the cost of reproduction and mailing; provided, however, that the Limited Owner requesting such list shall give written assurance that the list will not, in any event, be used for commercial purposes. Subject to applicable

inaction of such Covered Person if such Covered Person, in good faith, determined that such course of conduct was in the best interest of the Trust and such course of conduct did not constitute negligence or misconduct of such Covered Person.
Subject to the foregoing, neither the Managing Owner nor any other Covered Person shall be personally liable for the return or repayment of all or any portion of the capital or profits of any Limited Owner or assignee thereof, it being expressly
agreed that any such return of capital or profits made pursuant to this Trust Agreement shall be made solely from the assets of the Trust without any rights of contribution from the Managing Owner or any other Covered Person.  SECTION 4.6. Fiduciary Duty.  (a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, the Managing Owner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust, the Unitholders or to any other Person, the Managing Owner acting under this Agreement
shall not be liable to the Trust, the Unitholders or to any other Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement subject to the standard of care in Section 4.5 herein. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that
they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Managing Owner otherwise existing at law or in equity are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Managing Owner. Any material changes in the Trust’s basic
investment policies or structure shall occur only upon the written approval or affirmative vote of Limited Owners holding Units equal to at least a majority (over 50%) of the Net Asset Value of a Series (excluding Units held by the Managing Owner
and its Affiliates) of the Trust pursuant to Section 11.1(a) below.  (b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein:

TA-32 


Table of Contents
(ii) whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein
provides that the Managing Owner shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust, any Unitholder or any other Person,  the Managing Owner shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict,
agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the
Managing Owner, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by the Managing Owner shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Managing Owner at law or
in equity or otherwise.  (c) The Managing Owner and any Affiliate of the Managing Owner may engage in or possess an interest
in other profit-seeking or business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, whether or not such ventures are competitive with the Trust and the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not
apply to the Managing Owner. If the Managing Owner acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Trust, it shall have no duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the
Trust, and the Managing Owner shall not be liable to the Trust or to the Unitholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by reason of the fact that the Managing Owner pursues or acquires for, or directs such opportunity to another Person or
does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Trust. Neither the Trust nor any Unitholder shall have any rights or obligations by virtue of this Agreement or the trust relationship created hereby in or to such independent ventures or
the income or profits or losses derived therefrom, and the pursuit of such ventures, even if competitive with the activities of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Except to the extent expressly provided herein, the Managing Owner
may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Trust, the Unitholders or any Affiliate of the Trust or the Unitholders.  SECTION 4.7. Indemnification of the Managing Owner.  (a) The Managing Owner shall be indemnified by the
Trust against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities for the Trust, provided that the Managing Owner was acting on behalf of or performing services
for the Trust and has determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in the best interests of the Trust and such liability or loss was not the result of negligence, misconduct, or a breach of this Trust Agreement on the part of the
Managing Owner and (ii) any such indemnification will only be recoverable from the Trust Estate. All rights to indemnification permitted herein and payment of associated expenses shall not be affected by the dissolution or other cessation to
exist of the Managing Owner, or the withdrawal, adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Managing Owner, or the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy under Title 11 of the U.S. Code by or against the Managing Owner. The
source of payments made in respect of indemnification under this Trust Agreement shall be the assets of each Series on a pro rata basis, as the case may be.  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.7(a) above, the Managing Owner and any Person acting as broker-dealer for the Trust
shall not be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of Federal or state securities laws unless there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities
law violations as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs), (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of
competent jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee and the court approves the indemnification of such expenses (including, without limitation, litigation costs) or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims
against a particular indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made.  (c) In
any claim for indemnification for Federal or state securities law violations, the party seeking indemnification shall place before the court the position of the Securities and Exchange

Commission, the position of the Massachusetts Securities Division, the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, the Tennessee Securities Division and the position
of any other applicable state securities division which requires disclosure with respect to the issue of indemnification for securities law violations.  (d) The Trust shall not incur the cost of that portion of any insurance which insures any party against any liability, the indemnification of which is herein prohibited.  (e) Expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending civil, administrative or criminal action suit or proceeding against the
Managing Owner shall be paid by the Trust in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, if the legal action relates to the performance of duties or services by the Managing Owner on behalf of the Trust; (ii) the legal
action is initiated by a third party who is not a Limited Owner or the legal action is initiated by a Limited Owner and a court of competent jurisdiction specifically approves such advance; and (iii) the Managing Owner undertakes to repay the
advanced funds with interest to the Trust in cases in which it is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 4.7.  (f) The term “Managing Owner” as used only in this Section 4.7 shall include, in addition to the Managing Owner, any other Covered Person performing services on behalf of the Trust and acting within the scope of the Managing
Owner’s authority as set forth in this Trust Agreement.  (g) In the event the Trust is made a party to any claim,
dispute, demand or litigation or otherwise incurs any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense as a result of or in connection with any Limited Owner’s (or assignee’s) obligations or liabilities unrelated to Trust business, such Limited
Owner (or assignees cumulatively) shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless, and reimburse the Trust for all such loss, liability, damage, cost and expense incurred, including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees.  (h) The payment of any amount pursuant to this Section shall be subject to Section 3.6 with respect to the allocation of liabilities
and other amounts, as appropriate, among the Series of the Trust.  SECTION 4.8. Expenses and Limitations Thereon.  (a)  (i) The
Managing Owner or an Affiliate of the Managing Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all Organization and Offering Expenses incurred in connection with the creation of the Trust and sale of Units during or prior to the Initial Offering
Period other than any initial service fee; provided, however, that the amount of such Organization and Offering Expenses paid by the Managing Owner shall be subject to reimbursement by the Trust to the Managing Owner, without interest,
in up to 36 monthly payments during each of the first 36 months of the Continuous Offering Period. In the event that the amount of the Organization and Offering Expenses incurred in connection with the creation of the Trust and sale of Units during
the Initial Offering Period and paid by the Managing Owner is not fully reimbursed by the end of the 36th month of the Continuous Offering Period, the Managing Owner shall not be entitled to receive, and the Trust shall not be required to pay, any
unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of such date. In the event the Trust terminates prior to the completion of any reimbursement contemplated by this Section 4.8(a)(i), the Managing Owner shall not be entitled to receive, and
the Trust shall not be required to pay, any unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of the date of such termination.  (ii) The Managing Owner or an Affiliate of the Managing Owner also shall be responsible for the payment of all Organization and Offering Expenses incurred after the Initial Offering Period; provided, however, that the amount
of such Organization and Offering Expenses paid by the Managing Owner shall be subject to reimbursement by the Trust to the Managing Owner, without interest, in up to 36 monthly payments during

Offering Expenses incurred in connection with the sale of Units during the Continuous Offering Period and paid by the Managing Owner is not fully reimbursed by the end of the 36th month following the month in which such expenses were paid by the
Managing Owner, the Managing Owner shall not be entitled to receive, and the Trust shall not be required to pay, any unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of such date. In the event the Trust terminates prior to the completion of any
reimbursement contemplated by this Section 4.8(a)(ii), the Managing Owner shall not be entitled to receive, and the Trust shall not be required to pay, any unreimbursed portion of such expenses outstanding as of the date of such termination.

the Trust to the Managing Owner under Sections 4.8(a)(i) and (ii) in any month exceed 0.50% per annum of the Net Asset Value of the Fund as of the beginning of such month.  (iv) Organization and Offering Expenses shall mean those expenses incurred in connection with the formation, qualification and

absolute discretion.  SECTION 4.9. Compensation to the Managing Owner. Each Series shall pay to the Managing Owner, out of such
Series’ Trust Estate, in advance, a monthly management fee in an amount equal to 0.04166% (0.50% per annum) of such Series’ Series Net Asset Value as of the beginning of such month. The Managing Owner shall, in its capacity as a
Unitholder, be entitled to receive allocations and distributions pursuant to the provisions of this Trust Agreement.  SECTION 4.10.
Other Business of Unitholders. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, any of the Unitholders and any shareholder, officer, director, employee or other person holding a legal or beneficial interest in an entity which is a
Unitholder, may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of every nature and description, independently or with others, and the pursuit of such ventures, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed
wrongful or improper.  SECTION 4.11. Voluntary Withdrawal of the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner may withdraw voluntarily as the
Managing Owner of the Trust only upon one hundred and twenty (120) days’ prior written notice to all Limited Owners and the Trustee. If the withdrawing Managing Owner is the last remaining Managing Owner, Limited Owners holding Units equal

of the Trust. In the event of its removal or withdrawal, the Managing Owner shall be entitled to a redemption of its Unit at the Net Asset Value thereof on the next Redemption Date following the date of removal or withdrawal. If the Managing Owner

Each Limited Owner (or any permitted assignee thereof) hereby agrees that the Managing Owner is authorized to execute, deliver and perform the agreements, acts, transactions and

of the assets (to the extent that it is permitted to do so under the various other provisions of this Agreement) of the Managing Owner.  ARTICLE V  TRANSFERS OF UNITS  SECTION 5.1. General Prohibition. A Limited Owner may not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or pledge, hypothecate or in any manner encumber any or all of his Units or any part of his right, title
and interest in the capital or profits in the Trust except as permitted in this Article V and any act in violation of this Article V shall not be binding upon or recognized by the Trust (regardless of whether the Managing Owner shall have knowledge
thereof), unless approved in writing by the Managing Owner.  SECTION 5.2. Transfer of Managing Owner’s General Units.
 (a) Upon an Event of Withdrawal (as defined in Section 13.1), the Managing Owner’s General Units shall be

occurrence of its making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, filing a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, filing a petition or answer seeking for
itself any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any statute, law or regulation, filing an answer or other pleading admitting or failing to contest material allegations of a petition
filed against it in any proceeding of this nature or seeking, consenting to or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator for itself or of all or any substantial part of its properties.  (b) To the full extent permitted by law, and on sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Limited Owners, of their right to
vote thereon, if the transaction is other than with an Affiliated entity, nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the merger of the Managing Owner with another corporation or other entity, the reorganization of the Managing Owner
into or with any other corporation or other entity, the transfer of all the capital stock of the Managing Owner or the assumption of the Units, rights, duties and liabilities of the Managing Owner by, in the case of a merger, reorganization or
consolidation, the surviving corporation or other entity by operation of law or the transfer of the Managing Owner’s Units to an Affiliate of the Managing Owner. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the transactions referenced in the
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a voluntary withdrawal for purposes of Section 4.11 or an Event of Withdrawal or assignment of Units for purposes of Sections 5.2(a) or 5.2(c).  (c) Upon assignment of all of its Units, the Managing Owner shall not cease to be a Managing Owner of the Trust, or to have the power to
exercise any rights or powers as a Managing Owner, or to have liability for the obligations of the Trust under Section 1.7 hereof, until an additional Managing Owner, who shall carry on the business of the Trust, has been admitted to the Trust.
 SECTION 5.3. Transfer of Limited Units.  (a) Permitted assignees of the Limited Owners shall be admitted as substitute Limited Owners pursuant to this Article V only upon the
consent of the Managing Owner, which may be withheld by the Managing Owner (x) if the proposed assignee does not meet the established suitability requirements, or (y) to avoid adverse legal consequences to the Trust.  (i) A substituted Limited Owner is a permitted assignee that has been admitted as a Limited Owner with all the rights and powers of a
Limited Owner hereunder. If all of the conditions provided in Section 5.3(b) below are satisfied, the Managing Owner shall admit permitted assignees into the Trust as Limited Owners by making an entry on the books and records of the Trust
reflecting that such permitted assignees have been admitted as Limited Owners, and such permitted assignees will be deemed Limited Owners at such time as such admission is reflected on the books and records of the Trust.  (ii) A permitted assignee is a Person to whom a Limited Owner has assigned his Limited Units with the consent of the Managing Owner, as
provided below in Section 5.3(d), but who has not become a substituted Limited Owner. A permitted assignee shall have no right to vote, to obtain any information on or account of the Trust’s transactions or to inspect the Trust’s
books, but shall only be entitled to receive the share of the profits, or the return of the Capital Contribution, to which his assignor would otherwise be entitled as set forth in Section 5.3(d) below to the extent of the Limited Units
assigned. Each Limited Owner agrees that any permitted assignee may become a substituted Limited Owner without the further act or consent of any Limited Owner, regardless of whether his permitted assignee becomes a substituted Limited Owner.
 (iii) A Limited Owner shall bear all extraordinary costs (including attorneys’ and accountants’ fees), if any,
related to any transfer, assignment, pledge or encumbrance of his Limited Units.   
TA-37 


Table of Contents
(b) No permitted assignee of the whole or any portion of a Limited Owner’s Limited
Units shall have the right to become a substituted Limited Owner in place of his assignor unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:  (i) The written consent of the Managing Owner to such substitution shall be obtained, the granting or denial of which shall be within the sole and absolute discretion of the Managing Owner, subject to the provisions
of Section 5.3(d)(i).  (ii) A duly executed and acknowledged written instrument of assignment has been filed with the
Trust setting forth the intention of the assignor that the permitted assignee become a substituted Limited Owner in his place;  (iii) The assignor and permitted assignee execute and acknowledge and/or deliver such other instruments as the Managing Owner may deem necessary or desirable to effect such admission, including his execution, acknowledgment and delivery to
the Managing Owner, as a counterpart to this Trust Agreement, of a Power of Attorney in the form set forth in the Subscription Agreement; and  (iv) Upon the request of the Managing Owner, an opinion of the Trust’s independent legal counsel is obtained to the effect that (A) the assignment will not jeopardize the Trust’s tax classification as a
partnership and (B) the assignment does not violate this Trust Agreement or the Delaware Trust Statute.  (c) Any Person
admitted as a Unitholder shall be subject to all of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as if an original signatory hereto.  (d) (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(e) below, compliance with the suitability standards imposed by the Trust for the purchase of new Units, applicable Federal securities and state “Blue Sky” laws and the rules of
any other applicable governmental authority, a Limited Owner shall have the right to assign all or any of his Limited Units to any assignee by a written assignment (on a form acceptable to the Managing Owner) the terms of which are not in
contravention of any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement, which assignment has been executed by the assignor and received by the Trust and recorded on the books thereof. An assignee of a Limited Unit (or any interest therein) will not be
recognized as a permitted assignee without the consent of the Managing Owner, which consent the Managing Owner shall withhold only under the following circumstances: (A) if necessary, in the judgment of the Managing Owner (and upon receipt of
an opinion of counsel to this effect), to preserve the classification of the Trust as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes or to preserve the characterization or treatment of income or loss; or (B) if such assignment is effectuated
through an established securities market or a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). The Managing Owner shall withhold its consent to assignments made under the foregoing circumstances, and shall exercise such right by taking any
actions as it seems necessary or appropriate in its reasonable discretion so that such transfers or assignments of rights are not in fact recognized, and the assignor or transferor continues to be recognized by the Trust as a Unitholder for all
purposes hereunder, including the payment of any cash distribution. The Managing Owner shall incur no liability to any investor or prospective investor for any action or inaction by it in connection with the foregoing, provided it acted in good
faith.  (ii) Except as specifically provided in this Trust Agreement, a permitted assignee of a Unit shall be entitled to
receive distributions attributable to the Unit acquired by reason of such assignment from and after the effective date of the assignment of such Unit to him. The “effective date” of an assignment of a Limited Unit as used in this clause
shall be the first Business Day immediately following the next succeeding Redemption Date, provided the Managing Owner shall have been in receipt of the written 
  
TA-38 


Table of Contents

instrument of assignment for at least five (5) Business Days prior thereto. If the assignee is (A) an ancestor or descendant of the Limited Owner,
(B) the personal representative or heir of a deceased Limited Owner, (C) the trustee of a trust whose beneficiary is the Limited Owner or another person to whom a transfer could otherwise be made or (D) the shareholders, partners, or
beneficiaries of a corporation, partnership or trust upon its termination or liquidation, then the “effective date” of an assignment of a Unit in the Trust shall be the first day of the month immediately following the month in which the
written instrument of assignment is received by the Managing Owner.  (iii) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Trust and the Managing Owner shall be entitled to treat the permitted assignor of such Unit as the absolute owner thereof in all respects, and shall incur no liability for distributions made in good faith to him, until such time as the written
assignment has been received by, and recorded on the books of, the Trust.  (e) (i) No assignment or transfer of a Unit may
be made which would result in the Limited Owners and permitted assignees of the Limited Owners owning, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 5% or more of the stock of the Managing Owner or any related person as defined in
Sections 267(b) and 707(b)(1) of the Code. If any such assignment or transfer would otherwise be made by bequest, inheritance of operation of law, the Unit transferred shall be deemed sold by the transferor to the Trust immediately prior to such
transfer in the same manner as provided in Section 5.3(e)(iii).  (ii) No assignment or transfer of an interest may be
made which would contravene the NASAA Guidelines, as adopted in any state in which the proposed transferor and transferee reside including, without limitation, the restriction set forth in Paragraph F(2) of Article V thereof, which precludes any
assignment (except for assignments by gift, inheritance, intra family assignment, family dissolutions and transfers to affiliates), which would result in either the assignee or the assignor holding Units valued at less than $5,000 (or $2,000 in the
case of IRAs), provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply in respect of a Limited Owner wishing to assign its or his entire interest in the Trust.  (iii) Anything else to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding: (A) In any particular twelve (12) consecutive month
period no assignment or transfer of a Unit may be made which would result in increasing the aggregate total of Units previously assigned and/or transferred in said period to 49% or more of the outstanding Units. This limitation is hereinafter
referred to as the “forty-nine percent (49%) limitation”; (B) Clause (ii)(A) hereof shall not apply to a transfer by gift, bequest or inheritance, or a transfer to the Trust, and, for purposes of the forty-nine percent
(49%) limitation, any such transfer shall not be treated as such; (C) If, after the forty-nine percent (49%) limitation is reached in any consecutive 12 month period, a transfer of a Unit would otherwise take place by operation of law
(but not including any transfer referred to in clause (iii)(B) hereof) and would cause a violation of the forty-nine percent (49%) limitation, then said Unit(s) shall be deemed to have been sold by the transferor to the Trust in liquidation of
said Unit(s) immediately prior to such transfer for a liquidation price equal to the Net Asset Value of said Unit(s) on such date of transfer. The liquidation price shall be paid within 90 days after the date of the transfer.  (f) The Managing Owner, in its sole discretion, may cause the Trust to make, refrain from making, or once having made, to revoke, the
election referred to in Section 754 of the Code, and any similar election provided by state or local law, or any similar provision enacted in lieu thereof.  (g) The Managing Owner, in its sole discretion, may cause the Trust to make, refrain from making, or once having made, to revoke the
election by a qualified fund under Section 988(c)(1)(E)(V), and any similar election provided by state or local law, or any similar provision enacted in lieu thereof.

(h) Each Limited Owner hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Trust and each
Unitholder against any and all losses, damages, liabilities or expense (including, without limitation, tax liabilities or loss of tax benefits) arising, directly or indirectly, as a result of any transfer or purported transfer by such Limited Owner
in violation of any provision contained in this Section 5.3.  ARTICLE VI  DISTRIBUTION AND ALLOCATIONS  SECTION 6.1. Capital Accounts. A capital
account shall be established by the Managing Owner for each Unitholder with respect to each Series (such account sometimes hereinafter referred to as a “book capital account”). The initial balance of each Unitholder’s book capital
account shall be the amount of his initial Capital Contribution.  SECTION 6.2. Monthly Allocations. No less frequently than as of
the close of business (as determined by the Managing Owner) on each Valuation Point, the following determinations and allocations shall be made:  (a) First, any increase or decrease in the Series’ Net Asset Value as of such date as compared to the next previous determination of Net Asset Value shall be credited or charged to the book capital accounts of
the Unitholders in such Series in the ratio that the balance of each such Unitholder’s book capital account bears to the balance of all Unitholders’ in such Series’ book capital accounts; and  (b) Next, the amount of any distribution to be made to a Unitholder and any amount to be paid to a Unitholder upon redemption of his Units
shall be charged to that Unitholder’s book capital account as of the applicable record date and Redemption Date, respectively.  SECTION 6.3. Allocation of Profit and Loss for Federal Income Tax Purposes. As of the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust, each Series’ recognized profit and loss shall be allocated among the Unitholders of such Series pursuant
to the following subparagraphs for Federal income tax purposes. Except as otherwise provided herein, such allocations of profit and loss shall be pro rata from Disposition Gain (or Disposition Loss) and Profits (or Losses).  (a) First, the Profits or Losses shall be allocated pro rata among the Unitholders based on their respective book capital accounts
as of the last day of each month in which such Profits or Losses accrued.  (b) Next, Disposition Gain or Disposition Loss
from trading activities of a Series for each Fiscal Year of the Trust shall be allocated among the Unitholders as follows:  (i) There shall be established a tax capital account with respect to each outstanding Unit of a Series. The initial balance of each tax capital account shall be the amount paid by the Unitholder for the Unit. Tax capital accounts shall be
adjusted as of the end of each Fiscal Year as follows: (A) Each tax capital account shall be increased by the amount of income (Profits or Disposition Gain) which shall have been allocated to the Unitholder who shall hold the Unit pursuant to
Section 6.3(a) above and Sections 6.3(b)(ii) and 6.3(b)(iii) below; (B) Each tax capital account shall be decreased by the amount of expense or loss (Losses or Disposition Losses) which shall have been allocated to the Unitholder who shall
hold the Unit pursuant to Section 6.3(a) above and Sections 6.3(b)(iv) and 6.3(b)(v) below and by the amount of any distribution which shall have been received by the Unitholder with respect to the Unit (other than on redemption of Units); and
(C) If a Unit is redeemed, the tax capital account with respect to such Unit shall be eliminated on the Redemption Date.  (ii) Disposition Gain realized during any month shall be allocated first among all Unitholders whose book capital accounts are in excess of their Units’ tax capital accounts (after making the adjustments, other than adjustments
resulting from the allocations to be made pursuant to this Section 6.3(b)(ii) for the current month, described 
  
TA-40 


Table of Contents

in Section 6.3(b)(i) above) in the ratio that each such Unitholder’s excess shall bear to all such Unitholder’s excesses.  (iii) Disposition Gain realized during any month that remains after the allocation pursuant to Section 6.3(b)(ii) above shall be
allocated to those Unitholders who were Unitholders during such month in the ratio that each such Unitholder’s book capital account bears to all such Unitholders’ book capital accounts as of the beginning of such month.  (iv) Disposition Loss realized during any month shall be allocated first among all Unitholders whose Units’ tax capital accounts are
in excess of their book capital accounts (after making the adjustments, other than adjustments resulting from the allocations to be made pursuant to this Section 6.3(b)(iv) for the current month, described in Section 6.3(b)(i) above) in
the ratio that each such Unitholder’s excess shall bear to all such Unitholders’ excesses.  (v) Disposition Loss
realized during any month that remains after the allocation pursuant to Section 6.3(b)(iv) above shall be allocated to those Unitholders who were Unitholders during such month in the ratio that each such Unitholder’s book capital account
bears to all such Unitholders’ book capital accounts as of the beginning of such calendar month.  (c) The tax
allocations prescribed by this Section 6.3 shall be made to each holder of a Unit whether or not the holder is a substituted Limited Owner. For purposes of this Section 6.3, tax allocations shall be made to the Managing Owner’s Units
on a Unit-equivalent basis.  (d) The allocation of income and loss (and items thereof) for Federal income tax purposes set
forth in this Section 6.3 is intended to allocate taxable income and loss among Unitholders generally in the ratio and to the extent that net profit and net loss shall be allocated to such Unitholders under Section 6.2 so as to eliminate,
to the extent possible, any disparity between a Unitholder’s book capital account and his tax capital account, consistent with the principles set forth in Sections 704(b) and (c)(2) of the Code.  (e) Notwithstanding this Section 6.3, if after taking into account any distributions to be made with respect to such Unit for the
relevant period pursuant to Section 6.4 herein, any allocation would produce a deficit in the book capital account of a Unit, the portion of such allocation that would create such a deficit shall instead be allocated pro rata to the book
capital accounts of all the remaining Unitholders in such Series (subject to the same limitation).  SECTION 6.4. Allocation of
Distributions. Initially, distributions shall be made by the Managing Owner, and the Managing Owner shall have sole discretion in determining the amount and frequency of distributions, other than redemptions, with respect to the Units; provided,
however, that no distribution shall be made that violates the Delaware Trust Statute. The aggregate distributions made in a Fiscal Year (other than distributions on termination, which shall be allocated in the manner described in Article VIII) shall
be allocated among the holders of record of Units in the ratio in which the number of Units held of record by each of them bears to the number of Units held of record by all of the Unitholders as of the record date of such distribution; provided,
further, however, that any distribution made in respect of a Unit shall not exceed the book capital account for such Unit.  SECTION 6.5.
Admissions of Unitholders; Transfers. For purposes of this Article VI, Unitholders shall be deemed admitted, and a tax and book capital account shall be established in respect of the Units acquired by such Unitholder or in respect of
additional Units acquired by an existing Unitholder, as of the first day following the Redemption Date of the month in which such Unitholder’s Subscription Agreement or Exchange Request, as the case may be, is received, provided the Managing
Owner shall have been in receipt of such Subscription Agreement or Exchange Request for at least five Business Days, or in which the transfer of Units to such Unitholder is recognized, except that persons accepted as subscribers to the Trust
pursuant to Section 3.4(b) shall be deemed admitted on the date determined pursuant to such Section. Any Unitholder to whom a Unit had been transferred shall succeed to the tax and book capital accounts attributable to the Unit transferred.

SECTION 6.6. Liability for State and Local and Other Taxes. In the event that the Trust shall be
separately subject to taxation by any state or local or by any foreign taxing authority, the Trust shall be obligated to pay such taxes to such jurisdiction. In the event that the Trust shall be required to make payments to any Federal, state or
local or any foreign taxing authority in respect of any Unitholder’s allocable share of income, the amount of such taxes shall be considered a loan by the Trust to such Unitholder, and such Unitholder shall be liable for, and shall pay to the
Trust, any taxes so required to be withheld and paid over by the Trust within ten (10) days after the Managing Owner’s request therefor. Such Unitholder shall also be liable for (and the Managing Owner shall be entitled to redeem
additional Units of the foreign Unitholder as necessary to satisfy) interest on the amount of taxes paid over by the Trust to the IRS or other taxing authority, from the date of the Managing Owner’s request for payment to the date of payment or
the redemption, as the case may be, at the rate of two percent (2%) over the prime rate charged from time to time by Citibank, N.A. The amount, if any, payable by the Trust to the Unitholder in respect of its Units so redeemed, or in respect of
any other actual distribution by the Trust to such Unitholder, shall be reduced by any obligations owed to the Trust by the Unitholder, including, without limitation, the amount of any taxes required to be paid over by the Series to the IRS or other
taxing authority and interest thereon as aforesaid. Amounts, if any, deducted by the Trust from any actual distribution or redemption payment to such Unitholder shall be treated as an actual distribution to such Unitholder for all purposes of this
Trust Agreement.  ARTICLE VII  REDEMPTIONS  SECTION 7.1. Redemption of Units. The Unitholders recognize that the profitability of the Trust depends
upon long-term and uninterrupted investment of capital. It is agreed, therefore, that Trust profits and gains may be automatically reinvested, and that distributions, if any, of profits and gains to the Unitholders will be on a limited basis.
Nevertheless, the Unitholders contemplate the possibility that one or more of the Limited Owners may elect to realize and withdraw profits, or withdraw capital through the redemption of Units prior to dissolution. In that regard and subject
to the provisions of Section 4.2(i):  (a) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Article VII, each Limited Owner
(or any permitted assignee thereof) shall have the right to redeem a Limited Unit or portion thereof on the first Redemption Date following the date the Managing Owner has been in receipt of an acceptable form of written notice of redemption for at
least five Business Days. Units will be redeemed on a “first in, first out” basis based on time of receipt of redemption requests at a redemption price equal to the Net Asset Value per Unit calculated as of the Valuation Point immediately
preceding the applicable Redemption Date. If a Unitholder (or permitted assignee thereof) is permitted to redeem any or all of his Units as of a date other than a Redemption Date, such adjustments in the determination and allocation among the
Unitholders of Disposition Gain, Disposition Loss, Profits, Losses and items of income or deduction for tax accounting purposes shall be made as are necessary or appropriate to reflect and give effect to the redemption.  (b) The value of a Unit for purposes of redemption shall be the book capital account balance of such Unit at the Valuation Point
immediately preceding the Redemption Date, less any amount owing by such Limited Owner (and his permitted assignee, if any) to the Trust pursuant to Sections 4.7(g), 5.3(h) or 6.6 of this Trust Agreement. If redemption of a Unit shall be requested
by a permitted assignee, all amounts which shall be owed to the Trust under Sections 4.7(g), 5.3(h) or 6.6 hereof by the Unitholder of record, as well as all amounts which shall be owed by all permitted assignees of such Units, shall be deducted
from the Net Asset Value of such Units upon redemption.  (c) The effective date of redemption shall be the Redemption Date,
and payment of the value of the redeemed Units (except for Units redeemed as part of an Exchange as provided in Section 7.4) generally shall be made within fifteen Business Days following the Redemption Date; provided, that all liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, of the Trust, except any liability to Unitholders on account of their Capital Contributions, have been paid or there remains property of the Trust sufficient to pay them; and provided further, that under extraordinary
circumstances as may be determined by the Managing Owner in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, the inability to liquidate Commodity positions as of such Redemption Date, or default or delay in payments due the Trust from commodity
brokers, banks or other Persons, or significant administrative hardship, the Trust may in turn delay payment to Limited Owners

requesting redemption of Units of the proportionate part of the value of redeemed Units represented by the sums which are the subject of such default or
delay, in which event payment for redemption of such Units will be made to Limited Owners as soon thereafter as is practicable. A Limited Owner may revoke his notice of intent to redeem on or prior to the fifth Business Day prior to the applicable
Redemption Date by written instructions to the Managing Owner. If a Limited Owner revokes his notice of intent to redeem and thereafter wishes to redeem, such Limited Owner will be required to submit written notice thereof in accordance with
Section 7.1(d) and will be redeemed on the first Redemption Date to occur after the Managing Owner shall have been in receipt of such written notice for at least five Business Days.  (d) A Limited Owner (or any permitted assignee thereof) wishing to redeem Units must provide the Managing Owner with written notice of his
intent to redeem, which notice shall specify the name and address of the redeeming Limited Owner and the amount of Limited Units sought to be redeemed. The notice of redemption shall be in the form annexed to the Prospectus or in any other form
acceptable to the Managing Owner and shall be mailed or delivered to the principal place of business of the Managing Owner. Such notice must include representations and warranties that the redeeming Limited Owner (or any permitted assignee thereof)
is the lawful and beneficial owner of the Units to be redeemed and that such Units are not subject to any pledge or otherwise encumbered in any fashion. In certain circumstances, the Trust may require additional documents, such as, but not limited
to, trust instruments, death certificates, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Limited Owners requesting redemption shall be notified in writing within five Business Days following the Redemption Date
whether or not their Units will be redeemed, unless payment for the redeeming Units is made within that five Business Day period, in which case the notice of acceptance of the redemption shall not be required.  (e) The Managing Owner may suspend temporarily any redemption if the effect of such redemption, either alone or in conjunction with other
redemptions, would be to impair the Trust’s ability to operate in pursuit of its objectives. In addition, the Managing Owner may compel the redemption Units pursuant to Section 4.2(i).  (f) Units that are redeemed shall be extinguished and shall not be retained or reissued by the Trust.  (g) Except as discussed above, all requests for redemption in proper form will be honored, and positions will be liquidated to the extent
necessary to discharge liabilities on the Redemption Date.  SECTION 7.2. Redemption by the Managing Owner. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, for so long as it shall act as the Trust’s Managing Owner, the Managing Owner shall not transfer or redeem any of its General Units to the extent that any such transfer or redemption would
result in the Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates having less than a 1% interest in the Trust.  SECTION 7.3. Redemption Charge. The
Managing Owner may impose a redemption charge, if so provided in the Prospectus, with respect to any Unit; provided, however, that no redemption charge will be assessed if a Limited Owner simultaneously (i) exchanges the redeemed
Unit or portion thereof for a Unit of equal value in another Series, or (ii) invests the redemption proceeds in another futures fund sponsored by the Managing Owner and/or its Affiliates. Redemption charges may be waived by the Managing Owner
in its sole and absolute discretion.  SECTION 7.4. Exchange of Units. Units in one Series may be exchanged, without applicability of
redemption fees, for Units of equivalent value of any other Series (an “Exchange”) on any Redemption Date, in accordance with the Prospectus and subject to the conditions on Redemptions in this Article VII, except that an Exchange will be
made on the Redemption Date following the date the Managing Owner has been in receipt of an Exchange Request for at least five Business Days.  SECTION 7.5. Special Redemption Date. Pursuant to Section 9.4, each Limited Owner shall receive a notice of any decline (“Decline Notice”) in the estimated Net Asset Value per Unit to less than 50% of the Net Asset
Value per Unit as of the end of the immediately preceding Valuation Point (“Decline Date”) within seven Business 
  
TA-43

Days of such occurrence. Within 7 business days after any Decline Date, the Managing Owner shall declare a “Special Redemption Date” as provided in
this Section 7.5. Such Special Redemption Date shall be a business day within 30 business days from the Decline Date, and the Managing Owner shall mail the Decline Notice (which includes the Special Redemption Date) to each Unitholder and
assignee of Units, by first class mail, postage prepaid, not later than 7 business days after the Decline Date, together with instructions as to the procedure such Unitholder or assignee must follow to have such Unitholder’s or assignee’s
interest (only entire, not partial, interests may be so redeemed unless otherwise determined by the Managing Owner) in the Trust redeemed on the Special Redemption Date. Upon redemption pursuant to a Special Redemption Date, a Unitholder or any
other assignee of whom the Managing Owner has received written notice, shall receive from the Trust an amount equal to the Net Asset Value of such Unitholder’s interest, determined as of the close of business (as determined by the Managing
Owner) on such Special Redemption Date. No redemption charges shall be assessed on any such Special Redemption Date. As in the case of a regular redemption, an assignee shall not be entitled to redemption on any Special Redemption Date until the

Redemption Date.  ARTICLE VIII  THE LIMITED OWNERS  SECTION 8.1. No Management or Control; Limited Liability. The Limited Owners shall not

provided in Section 8.3 hereof, no Limited Owner shall be bound by, or be personally liable for, the expenses, liabilities or obligations of the Trust in excess of his Capital Contribution plus his share of any Trust Estate in which such
Limited Owners own a Unit and profits remaining, if any. Except as provided in Section 8.3 hereof, each Limited Unit owned by a Limited Owner shall be fully paid and no assessment shall be made against any Limited Owner. No salary shall be paid

the Trust, including, without limitation, such reports as are set forth in Article IX and such information as is set forth in Section 4.3(l) hereof. In the event that the Managing Owner neglects or refuses to produce or mail to a Limited Owner
a copy of the information set forth in Section 4.3(l) hereof, the Managing Owner shall be liable to such Limited Owner for the costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by such Limited Owner to compel the production of such
information, and for any actual damages suffered by such Limited Owner as a result of such refusal or neglect; provided, however, it shall be a defense of the Managing Owner that the actual purpose of the Limited Owner’s request for such
information was not reasonably related to the Limited Owner’s interest as a beneficial owner in the Trust (e.g., to secure such information in order to sell it, or to use the same for a commercial purpose unrelated to the participation of such
Limited Owner in the Trust). The foregoing rights are in addition to, and do not limit, other remedies available to Limited Owners under Federal or state law.  (b) The Limited Owners shall receive the share of the distributions provided for in this Trust Agreement in the manner and at the times

capital or as to profits, losses or distributions. No Limited Owner shall have the right to bring an action for partition against the Trust.  (d) Limited Owners holding Units representing at least a majority (over 50%) in Net Asset Value of each affected Series (not including
Units held by the Managing Owner and its Affiliates, including the commodity broker) voting separately as a class may vote to (i) continue the Trust as provided in Section 13.1(b), (ii) remove the Managing Owner on reasonable prior
written notice to the Managing Owner, (iii) elect and appoint one or more additional Managing Owners, or consent to such matters as are set forth in Section 5.2(b), (iv) approve a material change in the trading policies, as set forth
in the Prospectus, which change shall not be effective without the prior written approval of such majority, (v) approve the termination of any agreement entered into between the Trust and the Managing Owner or any Affiliate of the Managing
Owner for any reason, without penalty, (vi) approve amendments to this Trust Agreement as set forth in Section 11.1 hereof, and (vii) terminate the Series as provided in Section 13.1(g), and in the case of (iii), (iv) and
(v) in each instance on 60 days’ prior written notice.  Except as set forth above, the Limited Owners shall have
no voting or other rights with respect to the Trust.  SECTION 8.3. Limitation on Liability.  (a) Except as provided in Sections 4.7(g), 5.3(h) and 6.6 hereof, and as otherwise provided under Delaware law, the Limited Owners shall
be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the general corporation law of Delaware and no Limited Owner shall be liable for claims against, or debts of the
Trust in excess of his Capital Contribution and his share of the applicable Trust Estate and undistributed profits, except in the event that the liability is founded upon misstatements or omissions contained in such Limited Owner’s Subscription
Agreement delivered in connection with his purchase of Units. In addition, and subject to the exceptions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Trust shall not make a claim against a Limited Owner with respect to amounts distributed to
such Limited Owner or amounts received by such Limited Owner upon redemption unless, under Delaware law, such Limited Owner is liable to repay such amount.  (b) The Trust shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by law and the other provisions of this Agreement, and to the extent of the applicable Trust Estate, each Limited Owner (excluding the Managing Owner to the
extent of its ownership of any Limited Units) against any claims of liability asserted against such Limited Owner solely because he is a beneficial owner of one or more Units as a Limited Owner (other than for taxes for which such Limited Owner is
liable under Section 6.6 hereof).  (c) Every written note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or undertaking made
or issued by the Managing Owner shall give notice to the effect that the same was executed or made by or on behalf of the Trust and that the obligations of such instrument are not binding upon the Limited Owners individually but are binding only
upon the assets and property of the Trust, and no resort shall be had to the Limited Owners’ personal property for satisfaction of any obligation or claim thereunder, and appropriate references may be made to this Trust Agreement and may
contain any further recital which the Managing Owner deems appropriate, but the omission thereof shall not operate to bind the Limited Owners individually or otherwise invalidate any such note, bond, contract, instrument, certificate or undertaking.
Nothing contained in this Section 8.3 shall diminish the limitation on the liability of the Trust to the extent set forth in Section 3.5 and 3.6 hereof.

the Net Asset Value of each Series of the Trust, unless the proposed amendment affects only certain Series, in which case such amendment may be proposed by Limited Owners holding Units equal to at least ten percent (10%) of Net Asset Value of a
Series of each affected Series. Following such proposal, the Managing Owner shall submit to the Limited Owners of each affected Series a verbatim statement of any proposed amendment, and statements concerning the legality of such amendment and the

affirmative vote of Limited Owners holding Units equal to at least a majority (over 50%) of the Net Asset Value of a Series (excluding Units held by the Managing Owner and its Affiliates) of the Trust or, if the proposed amendment affects only
certain Series, of each affected Series, or such higher percentage as may be required by applicable law, and upon receipt of an opinion of independent legal counsel as set forth in Section 8.2 hereof and to the effect that the amendment is
legal, valid and binding and will not adversely affect the limitations on liability of the Limited Owners as described in Section 8.3 of this Trust Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where any action taken or authorized pursuant to any
provision of this Trust Agreement requires the approval or affirmative vote of Limited Owners holding a greater interest in Limited Units than is required to amend this Trust Agreement under this Section 11.1, and/or the approval or affirmative
vote of the Managing Owners, an amendment to such provision(s) shall be effective only upon the written approval or affirmative vote of the minimum number of Unitholders which would be required to take or authorize such action, or as may otherwise
be required by applicable law, and upon receipt of an opinion of independent legal counsel as set forth above in this Section 11.1. In addition, except as otherwise provided below, reduction of the capital account of any assignee or
modification of the percentage of Profits, Losses or distributions to which an assignee is entitled hereunder shall not be affected by amendment to this Trust Agreement without such assignee’s approval.

benefit of the Limited Owners, (ii) are necessary to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein or in the Prospectus, or to make any other provisions with respect
to matters or questions arising under this Trust Agreement or the Prospectus which 
  
TA-47 


Table of Contents

will not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Trust Agreement or the Prospectus, or (iii) the Managing Owner deems advisable, provided, however,
that no amendment shall be adopted pursuant to this clause (iii) unless the adoption thereof (A) is not adverse to the interests of the Limited Owners; (B) is consistent with Section 4.1 hereof; (C) except as otherwise
provided in Section 11.1(c) below, does not affect the allocation of Profits and Losses among the Limited Owners or between the Limited Owners and the Managing Owner; and (D) does not adversely affect the limitations on liability of the
Limited Owners, as described in Article VIII hereof or the status of the each Series as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. (i) Amendments to this document which adversely affect the rights of Limited Owners, (ii) the

Section 11.1(a) above.  (c) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in Sections 11.1(a) and
(b) hereof, the Managing Owner may, without the approval of the Limited Owners, amend the provisions of Article VI of this Trust Agreement relating to the allocations of Profits, Losses, Disposition Gain, Disposition Loss and distributions
among the Unitholders if the Trust is advised at any time by the Trust’s accountants or legal counsel that the allocations provided in Article VI of this Trust Agreement are unlikely to be respected for Federal income tax purposes, either
because of the promulgation of new or revised Treasury Regulations under Section 704 of the Code or other developments in the law. The Managing Owner is empowered to amend such provisions to the minimum extent necessary in accordance with the
advice of the accountants and counsel to effect the allocations and distributions provided in this Trust Agreement. New allocations made by the Managing Owner in reliance upon the advice of the accountants or counsel described above shall be deemed
to be made pursuant to the obligation of the Managing Owner to the Trust and the Limited Owners, and no such new allocation shall give rise to any claim or cause of action by any Limited Owner.  (d) Upon amendment of this Trust Agreement, the Certificate of Trust shall also be amended, if required by the Delaware Trust Statute, to
reflect such change.  (e) No amendment shall be made to this Trust Agreement without the consent of the Trustee if such
amendment adversely affects any of the rights, duties or liabilities of the Trustee; provided, however, that the Trustee may not withhold its consent for any action which the Limited Owners are permitted to take under Section 8.2(d) above. The
Trustee shall execute and file any amendment to the Certificate of Trust if so directed by the Managing Owner or if such amendment is required in the opinion of the Trustee.

accordance with this Section.  SECTION 11.2. Meetings of the Trust. Meetings of the Unitholders of the Trust or any Series thereof
may be called by the Managing Owner and will be called by it upon the written request of Limited Owners holding Units equal to at least 10% of the Net Asset Value of the Trust or any Series thereof. Such call for a meeting shall be deemed to have
been made upon the receipt by the Managing Owner of a written request from the requisite percentage of Limited Owners. The Managing Owner shall deposit in the United States mails, within 15 days after receipt of said request, written notice to all
Unitholders of the Trust or any Series thereof of the meeting and the purpose of the meeting, which shall be held on a date, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the date of mailing of said notice, at a reasonable time and place. Any notice
of meeting shall be accompanied by a description of the action to be taken at the meeting and an opinion of independent counsel as to the effect of such proposed action on the liability of Limited Owners for the debts of the Trust. Unitholders may
vote in person or by proxy at any such meeting.  SECTION 11.3. Action Without a Meeting. Any action required or permitted to be
taken by Unitholders by vote may be taken without a meeting by written consent setting forth the actions so taken. Such written consents shall be treated for all purposes as votes at a meeting. If the vote or consent of any Unitholder to any action
of the

Trust or any Unitholder, as contemplated by this Agreement, is solicited by the Managing Owner, the solicitation shall be effected by notice to each
Unitholder given in the manner provided in Section 15.4. The vote or consent of each Unitholder so solicited shall be deemed conclusively to have been cast or granted as requested in the notice of solicitation, whether or not the notice of

the notice of solicitation is effected. The Managing Owner and all persons dealing with the Trust shall be entitled to act in reliance on any vote or consent which is deemed cast or granted pursuant to this Section and shall be fully indemnified by
the Trust in so doing. Any action taken or omitted in reliance on any such deemed vote or consent of one or more Unitholders shall not be void or voidable by reason of timely communication made by or on behalf of all or any of such Unitholders in
any manner other than as expressly provided in Section 15.4.  ARTICLE XII  TERM  SECTION 12.1. Term. The
term for which the Trust and each Series is to exist shall commence on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Trust, and shall terminate pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII hereof or as otherwise provided by law.  ARTICLE XIII  TERMINATION

dissolution or revocation of the Managing Owner’s charter (and the expiration of 90 days after the date of notice to the Managing Owner of revocation without a reinstatement of its charter) or upon the withdrawal, removal, adjudication or
admission of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Managing Owner (each of the foregoing events an “Event of Withdrawal”) unless at the time there is at least one remaining Managing Owner and that remaining Managing Owner carries on the business
of the Trust or (ii) within 90 days of such Event of Withdrawal all the remaining Unitholders agree in writing to continue the business of the Trust and to select, effective as of the date of such event, one or more successor Managing Owners.
If the Trust is terminated as the result of an Event of Withdrawal and a failure of all remaining Unitholders to continue the business of the Trust and to appoint a successor Managing Owner as provided in clause (a)(ii) above, within 120 days of
such Event of Withdrawal, Limited Owners holding Units representing at least a majority (over 50%) of the Net Asset Value of each Series (not including Units held by the Managing Owner and its Affiliates) may elect to continue the business of the
Trust by forming a new statutory trust (the “Reconstituted Trust”) on the same terms and provisions as set forth in this Trust Agreement (whereupon the parties hereto shall execute and deliver any documents or instruments as may be
necessary to reform the Trust). Any such election must also provide for the election of a Managing Owner to the Reconstituted Trust. If such an election is made, all Limited Owners of the Trust shall be bound thereby and continue as Limited Owners
of the Reconstituted Trust.  (b) The occurrence of any event which would make unlawful the continued existence of the Trust
or any Series thereof, as the case may be.  (c) The failure to sell the Subscription Minimum (as defined in the Prospectus)

(g) The Limited Owners of each Series holding Units representing at least a majority (over 50%) of the Net Asset Value of the Series

Trust or Series as of the close of business on any Business Day declines below $10 million.  The death, legal disability,
bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, or withdrawal of any Limited Owner (as long as such Limited Owner is not the sole Limited Owner of the Trust) shall not result in the termination of the Trust or any Series thereof, and such Limited Owner, his
estate, custodian or personal representative shall have no right to withdraw or value such Limited Owner’s Units except as provided in Section 7.1 hereof. Each Limited Owner (and any assignee thereof) expressly agrees that in the event of

exercise, without further authorization or approval of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers conferred upon the Managing Owner under the terms of this Trust Agreement, subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise,
upon the exercise of such powers, and provided that the Liquidating Trustee shall not have general liability for the acts, omissions, obligations and expenses of the Trust. Thereafter, the business and affairs of the Trust or Series shall be wound
up and all assets shall be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and the proceeds therefrom shall be applied and distributed in the following order of priority: to the expenses of liquidation and termination
and to creditors, including Unitholders who are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the Trust (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof) other than liabilities
for distributions to Unitholders, and (b) to the Managing Owner and each Limited Owner pro rata in accordance with his positive book capital account balance, less any amount owing by such Unitholder to the Series, after giving effect to all
adjustments made pursuant to Article VI and all distributions theretofore made to the Unitholders pursuant to Article VI. After the distribution of all remaining assets of the Series, the Managing Owner will contribute to the Series an amount equal

Contributions made by the Managing Owner pursuant to this Section shall be applied first to satisfy any amounts then owed by the Series to its creditors, and the balance, if any, shall be distributed to those Unitholders in the Series whose book
capital account balances (immediately following the distribution of any liquidation proceeds) were positive, in proportion to their respective positive book capital account balances.

survive the delivery of such assignment for the sole purpose of enabling the Managing Owner to execute, acknowledge and file any instrument necessary to effect such substitution.  Each Limited Owner agrees to be bound by any representations made by the Managing Owner and by any successor thereto, determined to be
acting in good faith pursuant to such Power of Attorney and not constituting negligence or misconduct.

SECTION 14.3. Limitation on Power of Attorney. The Power of Attorney concurrently granted by each

thereof; provided, however, that causes of action for violations of Federal or state securities laws shall not be governed by this Section 15.1, and provided, further, that the parties hereto intend that the provisions hereof shall control over
any contrary or limiting statutory or common law of the State of Delaware (other than the Delaware Trust Statute) and that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, there shall not be applicable to the Trust, the Trustee, the Managing
Owner, the Unitholders or this Trust Agreement any provision of the laws (statutory or common) of the State of Delaware (other than the Delaware Trust Statute) pertaining to trusts which relate to or regulate in a manner inconsistent with the terms
hereof: the filing with any court or governmental body or agency of trustee accounts or schedules of trustee fees and charges, (b) affirmative requirements to post bonds for trustees, officers, agents, or employees of a trust, (c) the
necessity for obtaining court or other governmental approval concerning the acquisition, holding or disposition of real or personal property, (d) fees or other sums payable to trustees, officers, agents or employees of a trust, (e) the
allocation of receipts and expenditures to income or principal, (f) restrictions or limitations on the permissible nature, amount or concentration of trust investments or requirements relating to the titling, storage or other manner of holding
of trust assets, or (g) the establishment of fiduciary or other standards or responsibilities or limitations on the acts or powers of trustees or managers that are inconsistent with the limitations on liability or authorities and powers of the
Trustee or the Managing Owner set forth or referenced in this Trust Agreement. Section 3540 of Title 12 of the Delaware Code shall not apply to the Trust. The Trust shall be of the type commonly called a “statutory trust,” and without
limiting the provisions hereof, the Trust may exercise all powers that are ordinarily exercised by such a trust under Delaware law. The Trust specifically reserves the right to exercise any of the powers or privileges afforded to statutory trusts
and the absence of a specific reference herein to any such power, privilege or action shall not imply that the Trust may not exercise such power or privilege or take such actions.  SECTION 15.2. Provisions In Conflict With Law or Regulations.  (a) The provisions of this Trust Agreement are severable, and if the Managing Owner shall determine, with the advice of counsel, that any
one or more of such provisions (the “Conflicting Provisions”) are in conflict with the Code, the Delaware Trust Statute or other applicable Federal or state laws, the Conflicting Provisions shall be deemed never to have constituted a part
of this Trust Agreement, even without any amendment of this Trust Agreement pursuant to this Trust Agreement; provided, however, that such determination by the Managing Owner shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions of this Trust
Agreement or render invalid or improper any action taken or omitted prior to such determination. No Managing Owner or Trustee shall be liable for making or failing to make such a determination.  (b) If any provision of this Trust Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such holding shall not in any
manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction or any other provision of this Trust Agreement in any jurisdiction.  SECTION 15.3. Construction. In this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, words used in the singular or in the plural include both the plural and singular and words denoting any gender include
all genders. The title and headings of different parts are inserted for convenience and shall not affect the meaning, construction or effect of this Trust Agreement.

EXHIBIT B  WORLD MONITOR TRUST III      SUBSCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS  By executing a Subscription Agreement and Power of
Attorney Signature Page for Units of Beneficial Interest (“Units”) of Series J of World Monitor Trust III (the “Trust”), as indicated on the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page, each purchaser
(“Purchaser”) of Units irrevocably subscribes for Units of Series J indicated on the Purchaser’s Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page at a purchase price per Unit at Series J’s Net Asset Value per Unit
during the continuous offering, as described in the Prospectus of the Trust and Series J dated April 30, 2008 (the “Prospectus”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Prospectus.
 If Purchaser’s Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page is accepted, Purchaser agrees to contribute
Purchaser’s subscription to the Trust and to be bound by the terms of the Trust’s Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (“Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement”), which will be in substantially
the form of the Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement included in the Prospectus as Exhibit A. Purchaser agrees to reimburse the Trust and Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., the managing owner of the Trust (the “Managing
Owner”), for any expense or loss incurred by either as a result of the cancellation of Purchaser’s Units due to a failure of the Purchaser to deliver good funds in the full amount of the purchase price of the Units subscribed for by
Purchaser.  Representations and Warranties  As an inducement to the Managing Owner to accept this subscription, Purchaser, by executing and delivering Purchaser’s Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page, represents and warrants to the Trust, the Managing
Owner, and the Selling Agent as follows:  (a) Purchaser is at least twenty-one years old and is legally competent to execute
the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page. Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser has received (prior to any solicitation of Purchaser’s investment) a copy of the Prospectus — including the Appendices, the Declaration
of Trust and Trust Agreement and summary financial information relating to the Trust current within 60 calendar days — dated within nine months of the date as of which Purchaser has subscribed to purchase Units.  (b) All information that Purchaser has heretofore furnished to the Managing Owner or that is set forth in the Subscription Agreement and
Power of Attorney submitted by Purchaser is correct and complete as of the date of such Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney, and if there should be any change in such information prior to acceptance of Purchaser’s subscription,
Purchaser will immediately furnish such revised or corrected information to the Managing Owner.  (c) Unless (d) below
is applicable, Purchaser’s subscription is made with Purchaser’s funds for Purchaser’s own account and not as trustee, custodian or nominee for another.  (d) The subscription, if made as custodian for a minor, is a gift Purchaser has made to such minor and is not made with such minor’s
funds or, if not a gift, the representations as to net worth and annual income set forth below apply only to such minor.  (e) If Purchaser is subscribing in a representative capacity, Purchaser has full power and authority to purchase the Units and enter into and be bound by the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney on behalf of the entity for which
Purchaser is purchasing the Units, and such entity has full right and power to purchase such Units and enter into and be bound by the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney and to become a Unitholder and be bound by the terms and conditions of
the Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement.  (f) Purchaser either is not required to be registered with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) or to be a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”), or, if required to be so registered, is duly registered with the CFTC and is a member in good standing of the NFA. Purchaser
agrees to supply the Managing Owner with such information as the Managing Owner may reasonably request in order to verify the foregoing representation. Certain entities that acquire Units may, as a result, themselves become “commodity
pools” within the intent of applicable CFTC and NFA rules, and their sponsors, accordingly, will be required to register as “commodity pool operators.”   

SR-1 


Table of Contents
(g) The address set forth on the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature
Page is Purchaser’s true and correct address and Purchaser has no present intention of becoming a resident of any other state or country.  (h) If Purchaser is a trust or custodian under an Employee Benefit Plan (or otherwise is an entity which holds plan assets), none of the Trustee, the Managing Owner, the Advisors, any Selling Agent, or Clearing
Broker, or any of their affiliates either: (i) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of the assets of such entity being used to purchase Units; (ii) has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment
advice with respect to such assets for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that such advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to such assets and that such advice will be based on the particular
investment needs of the trust or custodian; or (iii) is an employer maintaining or contributing to the Trust.  (i) The
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Units will not result in or constitute a “prohibited transaction” under Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or, in the case of a governmental or church plan, any similar federal, state or local law) for which an exemption is not available.  (j) To the best knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser is independent of the Trust and any of the parties identified in paragraph
(h) above and the decision to invest in the Units was made entirely independently of such parties, and was not part of a coordinated or joint investment effort with one or more other investors.  (k) Purchaser has received a Prospectus of Series J, which constitutes its CFTC Disclosure Document.  (l) Purchaser is purchasing the Units for Purchaser’s own account.  (m) If trading for the applicable Series has commenced, Purchaser has received a copy of its most recent monthly report as required by the
CFTC.  (n) Purchaser acknowledges that as a holder or holders of any interests in, or claims of any kind against, Series J,
Purchaser will seek to recover any debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred or otherwise existing with respect to Series J solely from, or to assert such claims solely against, (i) the assets of Series J (and not the assets of any
other Series or the Trust generally) or (ii) the Managing Owner.  (o) Purchaser agrees to provide any information
deemed necessary by the Trust to comply with its anti-money laundering program and related responsibilities from time to time.  (p) Purchaser represents that Purchaser and each beneficial owner of Purchaser is (i) not an individual, entity or organization identified on any U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control “watch list” and does not have any
affiliation of any kind with such an individual, entity or organization; (ii) not a foreign shell bank; and (iii) not a person or entity resident in or whose subscription funds are transferred from or through a jurisdiction identified as
non-cooperative by the U.S. Financial Action Task Force.  (q) Purchaser represents that Purchaser is not, and no beneficial
owner of Purchaser is, a senior foreign political figure,1 an immediate family member of a senior foreign political figure2 or a close associate of a senior foreign political figure.3   


1
A “senior foreign political figure” is defined as an official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial branches of a foreign government (whether
elected or not), a senior official of a major foreign political party, or a senior executive of a foreign government-owned corporation. In addition, a “senior foreign political figure” includes any corporation, business or other entity
that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, a senior foreign political figure. 


2
“Immediate family” of a senior foreign political figure typically includes the figure’s parents, siblings, spouse, children and in-laws. 


3
A “close associate” of a senior foreign political figure is a person who is widely and publicly known to maintain an unusually close relationship with the senior foreign
political figure, and includes a person who is in a position to conduct substantial domestic and international financial transactions on behalf of the senior foreign political figure.

Series”), agrees and consents (the “Consent”) to look solely to the assets (the “Contracting Series Assets”) of the relevant Contracting Series and to the Managing Owner and its assets for payment in respect of any claim
against or obligation of Series J. The Contracting Series Assets of Series J include only those funds and other assets that are paid, held or distributed to the Trust on account of and for the benefit of such Contracting Series, including, without
limitation, funds delivered to the Trust for the purchase of Units in Series J.  In furtherance of the Consent, Purchaser agrees, with
respect to each Contracting Series, that (i) any debts, liabilities, obligations, indebtedness, expenses and claims of any nature and of all kinds and descriptions (collectively, “Claims”) of such Contracting Series incurred,
contracted for or otherwise existing and (ii) any Units, beneficial interests or equity ownership of any kind (collectively, “Units”) of such Contracting Series, arising from, related to or in connection with the Trust and its assets
and the Contracting Series and the Contracting Series Assets, shall be subject to the following limitations:  (a)
(i) except as set forth below, the Claims and Units, if any, of the Subscriber (collectively, the “Subordinated Claims and Units”) shall be expressly subordinate and junior in right of payment to any and all other claims against and
Units in the Trust and Series J thereof, and any of their respective assets, which may arise as a matter of law or pursuant to any contract; provided, however, that the Subscriber’s Claims (if any) against and Units (if any) in the Contracting
Series shall not be considered Subordinated Claims and Units with respect to enforcement against and distribution and repayment from the Contracting Series, the Contracting Series Assets and the Managing Owner and its assets; and provided further
that (1) the Subscriber’s valid Claims, if any, against the Contracting Series shall be pari passu and equal in right of repayment and distribution with all other valid Claims against the Contracting Series and (2) the
Subscriber’s Units, if any, in the Contracting Series shall be pari passu and equal in right of repayment and distribution with all other Units in the Contracting Series; and (ii) the Subscriber will not take, demand, or receive from
Series J or the Trust or any of their respective assets (other than the Contracting Series, the Contracting Series Assets and the Managing Owner and its assets) any payment for the Subordinated Claims and Units;  (b) the Claims and Units of the Subscriber with respect to the Contracting Series shall only be asserted and enforceable against the
Contracting Series, the Contracting Series Assets and the Managing Owner and its assets and such Claims and Units shall not be asserted or enforceable for any reason whatsoever against any other Series, the Trust generally or any of their respective
assets;  (c) if the Claims of the Subscriber against the Contracting Series or the Trust are secured in whole or in part,
the Subscriber hereby waives (under section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code [11 U.S.C. §1111(b)]) any right to have any deficiency Claims (which deficiency Claims may arise in the event such security is inadequate to satisfy such
Claims) treated as unsecured Claims against the Trust or the Series (other than the Contracting Series), as the case may be;   
SR-3 


Table of Contents
(d) in furtherance of the foregoing, if and to the extent that the Subscriber receives
monies in connection with the Subordinated Claims and Units from a Series or the Trust (or their respective assets), other than the Contracting Series, the Contracting Series Assets and the Managing Owner and its assets, the Subscriber shall be
deemed to hold such monies in trust and shall promptly remit such monies to the Series or the Trust that paid such amounts for distribution by the Series or the Trust in accordance with the terms hereof; and  (e) the foregoing Consent shall apply at all times notwithstanding that the Claims are satisfied, the Units are sold, transferred,
redeemed or in any way disposed of and notwithstanding that the agreements in respect of such Claims and Units are terminated, rescinded or canceled.  The representations and statements set forth herein may be asserted in the defense of the Trust, the Managing Owner, the Advisors to the Trust, the Selling Agents or others in any subsequent litigation or other
proceeding.      Investor Suitability  Purchaser understands that

 World Monitor Trust III  c/o Preferred Investment
Solutions Corp., Managing Owner  900 King Street, Suite 100  Rye Brook, New York 10573  Attention: Investor Services  Dear Sirs:  1. Subscription for Units. I hereby subscribe for the number of units of beneficial interest (“Units”)
of Series J of World Monitor Trust III (the “Trust”) set forth in the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney Signature Page, at Series J’s Net Asset Value per Unit during the continuous offering as set forth in the prospectus of
the Trust dated April 30, 2008 (the “Prospectus”). Units are offered as of the beginning of each calendar month (until such time as the offering is discontinued). The settlement date for my purchase of Units will be not more than five
business days after the purchase date of my Units, which will occur as of the first day of the calendar month immediately following the month during which my subscription is accepted. I understand that all investors will have the right to revoke
their subscriptions, and receive a refund of their invested funds, for a period of five business days following receipt of the Prospectus. Preferred Investment Solutions Corp., the Managing Owner of the Trust (“the Managing Owner”), may,
in its sole and absolute discretion, accept or reject this subscription in whole or in part, except that, if this subscription is to be accepted in part only, it shall not be reduced to an amount less than $5,000; $2,000 in the case of persons
permitted to purchase such lesser minimum, as described above. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all subscriptions once submitted are irrevocable. All Units are offered subject to prior sale.  2. Representations and Warranties of Subscriber. I have received the Prospectus together with summary financial information relating to the Trust
current within 60 calendar days. I understand that by submitting this Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney I am making the representations and warranties set forth in “Exhibit B - Subscription Requirements” contained in the
Prospectus including without limitation, those representations and warranties relating to my net worth and annual income set forth therein and compliance with CFTC and anti-money laundering regulations.  3. Power of Attorney. In connection with my acceptance of an interest in the Trust, I do hereby irrevocably constitute and appoint the Managing
Owner, and its successors and assigns, as my true and lawful Attorney-in-Fact, with full power of substitution, in my name, place and stead, to (i) file, prosecute, defend, settle or compromise litigation, claims or arbitrations on behalf of
the Trust and each Series and (ii) make, execute, sign, acknowledge, swear to, deliver, record and file any documents or instruments which may be considered necessary or desirable by the Managing Owner to carry out fully the provisions of the
Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust, which is attached as Exhibit A to the Prospectus, including, without limitation, the execution of the said Agreement itself and effecting all amendments permitted by
the terms thereof. The Power of Attorney granted hereby shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and shall survive, and shall not be affected by, my subsequent death, incapacity, disability, insolvency or dissolution
or any delivery by me of an assignment of the whole or any portion of my Units.  4. Irrevocability; Governing Law. I hereby
acknowledge and agree that I am not entitled to cancel, terminate or revoke this subscription or any of my agreements hereunder after the Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney has been submitted (and not rejected) and that this subscription
and such agreements shall survive my death or disability, but shall terminate with the full redemption of all my Units in the Trust. This Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of law.  5 ERISA. If the undersigned is acting on behalf of an
“employee benefit plan,” as defined in and subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or any “plan,” as defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) (each such employee benefit plan and plan, a “Plan”), the individual signing this Subscription Agreement and Power of Attorney on behalf of the undersigned, understands, as or on behalf of the fiduciary of
the Plan responsible for purchasing the Units (the “Plan Fiduciary”) that: (a) the Plan Fiduciary has considered an investment in the Trust for such Plan in light of the risks relating thereto; (b) the Plan Fiduciary has
determined that, in view of such considerations, the investment in the Trust for such Plan is consistent with the Plan Fiduciary’s responsibilities under ERISA; (c) the Plan’s investment in the Trust does not violate and is not
otherwise inconsistent with the terms of any legal document constituting the Plan or any trust agreement thereunder; (d) the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Units will not result in or constitute a “prohibited transaction”
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or in the case of a governmental or church plan, any similar federal, state or local law) for which an exemption is not available; (e) the Plan’s

transactions” by “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons,” as defined therein.  6. Risks. The Units
are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Risks relating to the Units include: (i) you could lose all or substantially all of your investment; (ii) the Trust is highly leveraged and trades in volatile markets;
(iii) performance can be extremely volatile; (iv) substantial expenses must be offset by trading profits and interest income; and (v) the Trust trades to a substantial degree on non-U.S. markets which are not subject to the same
degree of regulation as U.S. markets. See “The Risks You Face” beginning on page 15 of the Prospectus.  READ AND COMPLETE
