Helen RankinSince Jun 2015 / 1 reviewsThis partner has a rating of 5 starsaboutproductsreviewsneed to knowHelen Rankin Helen Rankin is a British contemporary jewellery designer creating innovative and covetable designs.With the ultimate focus always on movement and wearability, Helen's jewellery exudes modernity and simplicity. Her signature aesthetic is defined by angles, interlocking, overlapping, contrast and scale. Crisp lines and blacked sterling silver add drama whilst semi precious stones provide colour and interest. Meticulous hand finishing maintains a luxury feel to the collections.Inspiration comes from modern architecture, geometric decorative features and repetitive pattern found in textiles and tiles and the works of art from the 50s Brazilian Concrete art movement.Having graduated with a BA in Jewellery design at Middlesex University in 1997 Helen is now emerging into business with her fresh new designs and is now working from her workshop at Brass Monkeys in Hove.Like this partner?Share it on Share on Facebook Share on TwitterOur Productsview all productsThis is a product from Helen Rankin named Geom Balance EarringsGeom Balance Earrings£95This is a product from Helen Rankin named Geom Nugget NecklaceGeom Nugget Necklace£65This is a product from Helen Rankin named Flat Geom Stud EarringsFlat Geom Stud Earrings£75This is a product from Helen Rankin named Rhythm Angle EarringsRhythm Angle Earrings£80newThis is a product from Helen Rankin named Sync Oxidised BangleSync Oxidised Bangle£225newThis is a product from Helen Rankin named Sync Necklace GoldSync Necklace Gold£135newThis is a product from Helen Rankin named Sync Stud EarringsSync Stud Earrings£75This is a product from Helen Rankin named Sync Mini Hoop Earrings OxidisedSync Mini Hoop Earrings Oxidised£75This is a product from Helen Rankin named Geom Regular EarringsGeom Regular Earrings£105This is a product from Helen Rankin named Rhythm Stud Chain EarringsRhythm Stud Chain Earrings£90ReviewsView Productlink to view product"Beautiful, elegant and unique"read moreIndependent reviewDeliveryAll orders are sent using UK Royal Mail signed-for services and a signature is required on receipt.
