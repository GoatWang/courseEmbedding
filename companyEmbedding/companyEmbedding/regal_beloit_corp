Regal Beloit Corporation, usually referred to as Regal, is a manufacturer of electric motors headquartered in Beloit, Wisconsin. The company has manufacturing, sales, and service facilities throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia, with over 23,000 employees. As of year 2014, the company is ranked 713th on the Fortune 1000, and was the 17th largest corporation in Wisconsin.[2]
One of the largest electric motor manufacturers in the world, its Genteq brand brushless DC electric motors are found in almost all variable-speed residential HVAC equipment in the United States today, and its GE Commercial Motors, Leeson, and Marathon Electric Motor brands are used throughout the industrial sector.[3]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1955 as Beloit Tool Corporation, and began operations in a converted roller rink. In 1961, it moved to facilities in South Beloit, Illinois, and in 1969 it changed its name to Regal Beloit. In the 1980s the company expanded its product line with a series of acquisitions of smaller companies, and in 1991 its headquarters were moved to downtown Beloit. In 2004, two acquisitions from General Electric effectively doubled the size of the company.[4]
In July 2007, Regal acquired the Fasco electrical components business of Tecumseh Products for $220 million in cash.[5]
In end of 2007, Regal acquired the Dutchi Motors B. V. for $34 million in cash and $3.2 million in net liabilities.[6]
In April 2010, the company acquired CMG Engineering Group, a manufacturer of industrial motors, blowers and metal products, for $75 million in cash.[7]
In 2011, the company completed the largest acquisition in its history by purchasing A.O. Smith's Electrical Products Company. This acquisition added about $700 million in sales revenues, and further expanded the company in Mexico and China, while adding new products to its production lines.
On 9 July 2013, Regal Beloit announced that its plant in Springfield, Missouri would face a staged closing over the next 18 months in order to remain globally competitive.[8] On 5 June 2014, Regal Beloit announced that two plants in Kentucky would face a staged closing over the next 18 months in order to remain globally competitive. This move will affect over 200 employees.
In the latest news, Regal Beloit acquired Power Transmission Solutions business (PTS) from Emerson Electric Co. for approximately $1.4 billion — $1.4 billion in cash plus $40 million of assumed liabilities, effective from Jan 30th, 2015. The business manufactures, sells and services bearings, couplings, gearing, drive components, and conveyor systems under brands including Browning, Jaure, Kop-Flex, McGill, Morse, Rollway, Sealmaster and System Plast. With annual revenues of approximately $600 million, PTS has over 3,000 employees around the world. PTS will become part of Regal's newly defined Power Transmission segment. [9]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The modular roller top belt was designed to solve a range of increasingly challenging transfer and diverting problems complicating operations in distribution centers, particularly retail e-commerce distribution.

                                                    Simulation-Based Noise Estimation for Cooling Fan Designs
                                                


Regal needed to develop a simulation-based method of estimating noise levels for their electric motors due to changes in cooling fan design. Previously, physical testing was used to predict the noise levels.

                                                    Freedom of Movement: The Modular Roller Top Transfer and Diverting Station
                                                


The modular roller top belt was designed to solve a range of increasingly challenging transfer and diverting problems complicating operations in distribution centers, particularly retail e-commerce distribution.                                        







                                                    Motor Programming Made Easy
                                                


The Genteq® Brand revolutionized the motor industry with the OEM ECM in 1987, the retrofit ECM in 2007, and now the wireless field programmer for retrofit indoor ECM blower motors.                                        







                                                    Simulation-Based Noise Estimation for Cooling Fan Designs
                                                


Regal needed to develop a simulation-based method of estimating noise levels for their electric motors due to changes in cooling fan design. Previously, physical testing was used to predict the noise levels.

                                                    Breakthrough Motor Design Concept Changes the Game for HVAC Manufacturers
                                                


With UlteMAX™ Axial IHP motors, manufacturers have a completely new way to look at the design of their HVAC and other thermal air-moving systems. Across the board — in size, weight, configurability, software controls, simplified installation and versatile motor performance                                        







                                                    Making the Grade with HVAC System Upgrade
                                                


Thousands of U.S. schools have figured out ways to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements, demonstrating that smart energy choices can have lasting benefits for their students, their communities and the environment.                                        







                                                    The Development of the Axial Integral Horsepower Motor
                                                


For equipment manufacturers, it offers a completely new path and platform for innovation and performance with game-changing implications for the commercial air handling equipment industry in terms of motor size, weight, design, intelligence and functionality across a range of power ratings.                                        





 




INDUSTRIES







Pumping

The pumping industry is driven by demands for higher efficiencies and integrated solutions whereby higher motor speeds translate into higher performance and a smaller more economical pump assembly.










Air Moving


                    The air moving industry is driven by demands for higher efficiencies and integrated solutions whereby fan weight and size are reduced and embedded controls provided for higher performance. 
                











Commercial Laundry


                        Commercial laundry applications include on-premise, laundromat and multi-unit housing.
                    








Material Handling


                        Warehouse distribution looks for solutions to minimize energy consumption and optimize production output.
                    








Crane, Hoist & Winch


                        Ship-to-shore and container cranes are continuing to increase in size. This also brings improvements to speeds and load capacities.
