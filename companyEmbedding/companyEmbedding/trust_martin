Review This Product














                American society is experiencing a profound crisis of trust, from government to mass media to educational and religious institutions. Whether we acknowledge it or not, this crisis affects us all.

^^In Building Cultures of Trust Martin Marty proposes ways to improve the conditions for trust at what might be called the "grassroots" level. He suggests that it makes a difference if citizens put energy into inventing, developing, and encouraging "cultures of trust" in all areas of life - families, schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, and churches. His analysis is particularly poignant and his conclusions especially helpful when he advocates trust-building in the religion-versus-science debate, rather than the confrontational postures that characterize much of that debate today. Marty believes that such efforts at trust-building will do more than just trickle up to larger areas of society; they will become slow-spreading habits of honesty, inspiring trust on a culture-changing scale.
^^Of course, Marty acknowledges that the reality of human nature tends toward trust-breaking, not trust-building - all the more reason, he argues, to develop strategies to bring about improvements incrementally, one small step at a time. In reply to those who remain skeptical that small-scale efforts at trust-building can make a difference, that efforts to understand and deal honestly with each other can improve the conditions for trust, Marty asks, What is the alternative?^^

Lex Charitatis (Emory University Studies In Law And Religion Series)

    This substantial work by one of Europe's most respected twentieth-century legal minds unpacks Luther's doctrine of law, showing how it derived from his central theological concern, justification by faith.

"When Johannes Heckel's Lex Charitatis appeared more than half a century ago, it brought new clarity to the much-disputed issue of Luther's understanding of the law and of God's governance of his created order. The Wittenberg reformer's use of the language of 'two kingdoms' and 'two governances' is still fiercely debated; having Heckel's work in English will assist scholars and students alike in putting Luther's insights to use in the context of twenty-first-century problems."

Building Cultures of Trust 


Marty, Martin E. (Author)	
									        	
									






Description


American society is experiencing a profound crisis of trust, from government to mass media to educational and religious institutions. And — whether we realize it or not — this crisis affects us all. In Building Cultures of Trust, Martin Marty proposes ways of improving the conditions for trust at what might be called the "grass roots" level. He suggests that it makes a difference if citizens put energy into inventing, developing, and encouraging "cultures of trust" in all areas of life — families, schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, churches, and more. Marty believes that such efforts at trust-building will do more than trickle up to larger areas of society; it will become a slow spreading of habits of honesty, inspiring trust on a culture-changing scale. Far from na�ve, Marty realizes that the reality of human nature tends towards trust-breaking, not trust-building. All the more reason, he argues, to develop strategies to bring about improvements, one small step at a time.
