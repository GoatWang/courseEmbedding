            Does this ladder fold up or does it stay the same length of 24 ft at all times?

            how tall of a ladder to reach gutters @ ~19 feet
        

            Mayber there is a formula for calculating the height needed to cover how far you should pull away from wall for a safe slant, etc. My guess is probably 24' ladder would let me slant it adequately plus extend a bit past the gutter.

TIA for any info.

            Does the ladder support up to 300lbs when it is full extended or is that just when the ladder is in its doubled position?
        

            I need to clean gutters that are high on my house. I do not weigh 300lbs but more than 250lbs. Will this thing support me if I extend it all the way out?

It did all I needed it to do , but not all I expected it to do. I was "innocent" enough to expect that a ladder advertised as a 24 foot ladder would extend to a usable 24 foot length. Not so! The good news is that I only needed it's 21 foot reach to accomplish what needed doing on our 2-story home. Even at 285 lbs. I felt fairly steady at the top of this ladder fully extended. Seems to be a good, solid ladder; pretty well satisfied with it.

My first use of the Werner 32' ladder was a fascia repair 2+ stories off the ground.  Like my other Werner ladders; 24', 8' A-frame and 6' A-frame, it was very sturdy at height.  Easy to extend, comfortable to climb, great to work on and best of all, two feet back on the ground safely.  Thank you Werner & Home Depot for your quality products.

After a few weeks, I've only used it a couple of times so far, but it hasn't fallen apart yet. So far, I prefer it to my other extension ladder, an aluminum one. Operation seems smoother, and this has better traction on the rungs. Only time will tell if this ladder is as durable.

I'm very happy with this ladder. It's light in weight yet very solid feeling even when fully extended. It's long enough to reach the roof of my 1920's Colonial. Great ladder for painting.

This is a heavy-duty ladder. I bought it for use painting the trim on my three-story house and it's just what I wanted - very strong and solid. One thing to keep in mind is that it's a lot heavier than a light-duty aluminum ladder, so raising it to full height is definitely a two-man job, especially with stabilizer arms (which I highly recommend - I bought the Werner Quickclick) in place. I will probably sell it once I finish my painting job - it's more than I need for routine gutter cleaning and maintenance.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer.

They Aren't Just "LBJs"Product Type: Science FeatureYear: 2002Author(s): Ruth, JSuggested Citation: Ruth, J. 2002. They Aren't Just "LBJs". 01/01/1901By way of explanation for the title ..... when presented with the challenge of identifying sparrows and other grassland birds, many people prefer to simply refer to them as LBJs (or "little brown jobs"). Identification is particularly challenging in the winter when these birds are cryptically colored, are not singing identifiable songs, and prefer to respond to disturbances by hiding in the grass or running along the ground like little mice. However, after several years of conducting research on habitat use by and effects of grazing on wintering grassland birds, I can tell you that the effort is well worth the struggle. Holding a Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii) in the hand, with the warm ochre color washing over its face, crown, and nape, or managing a good look at a crouching Chestnut-collared Longspur (Calcarius ornatus) male coming into breeding plumage, in the split second before he bursts into the air from under your feet, is worth all the frustrations of "unknown sparrows" in between...
