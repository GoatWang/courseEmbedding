The tub is finally big enough for the kids to pretend "swim" in, and we thank Tom for suggesting to go with the bigger tub to suite our family needs. If you are a parent, you know how tough bathtime can be, and ever since the guidance I got from Tom and the project manager, bath time with the kids has been so pleasant. The functionality of my bathroom now is just amazing, I have space in the double vanity we got, I have space in the linen closet we got, I have shower in coves (tiled) for all our shampoos and such (which now the kids cant get to). The workmanship from this company and their carpenters is just impeccable. Any issue we came across, they handled immediately and with perfection. There was just one small issue with tile date arrival (partly my fault for picking special order tile), but Tom was able to get the girls in the office to research and track down my tile so there was absolutely NO delay! I was very impressed with everyones work ethic from start to finish. The finish is great and we are so happy. If you want your bathroom done in a timely manner, with all the great design details and functionality for your family, then contact these guys. I kid you not, it was such a pleasure! Thank you to Tom, Eric, and all the staff at Bella! Lorenc Constructionmy2centstoo ratedIt's difficult to find a good contractor- either someone recommends one or you look in the telephone book and take your chances, or nowadays on the internet. I selected Lorenc based on the favorable reviews I had read online. After the latest snowstorm I had water leaking down through the roof and through my kitchen ceiling and into the basement. Lorenc came out fully prepared to go up on my 3rd story roof and he did. He was able to tell me what the problem was and what was needed to correct it. This is a very knowledgeable man when it comes to houses and construction. Lorenc and his team of workers were true gentleman and respectful of us and our property. They were careful to cover things with plastic, laid tarps on the floor because of the snow and ice, cleaned up after each phase of the job. The roof and gutter system were repaired, interior walls/ceiling were repaired and painted, basement wall- beautiful.As I said- it is difficult to find a good contractor- and I know one when I find him. Lorenc is a gem and I will have him do any construction /renovation work that is needed here in the future. Trust me- this guy is good!Bella Brothers Constructionmelissalong ratedI'm back again! Although this is my first time leaving a review for Bella!!! I have had both my kitchen and bathroom remodeled by Tom and Bella Brothers. I have nothing but great things to say about this company. I was so happy I decided to call Bella, the girls are so sweet in the office and very accommodating. Tom was prompt on all his appointments scheduled with me, and kept in touch throughout all my remodels (both kitchen and bathroom renovations). I was really scared I was going to be out of the loop and not understand what was going on during construction, but the men were so nice to explain things to me, and their processes. I'm sure I was a pain, but they never showed it on their faces :) I chose to have Bella remodel my bathroom after my kitchen because of their diligence while working on my kitchen. I couldnt imagine a better company to tackle such big jobs for me. so thank you again guys and look forward to that basement renovations we've been discussing! Sincerely,Melisssa!!!Mr Contractor IncDiana S. ratedQuality WorkWe called the company out for an additional bedroom we wanted to build. The man that came over, Ken, was not looking at my old space but envisioning the finished room. He knew exactly what needed to be done in every part of the floor it's on and spent time answering any questions we had. He never made us feel like we were bothersome with our inexperience and many questions about colors and closets and electricity. The job was done from beginning to end with every specification nothing less than perfection! Ken and Mr. Contractor is not just a construction, painting, slapping together a room type of business. At. All! Ken is an artist in his own right seeing beauty and potential where there are old spaces in need of renewal. Thank you for everything Mr. Contractor! Especially the way you treated our family. You're a class act a all the way! 5 STARS!Bella Brothers ConstructionBarbara H. ratedHi Tom,I just wanted to send you a small note about my latest remodel completed by your staff. I really, really appreciated the courtesy and kindness afforded to me at a very stressful time, with my Mom being sick. Your thoroughness of explaining the work was outstanding as well as the quality of work that was done on my bathroom and my walls which had water damage. Thank you for keeping me informed and the constant follow up as the work was being completed.Your staff is amazing!I will continue to recommend Bella Brothers to friends, relatives, neighbors, and colleagues.Once again thank you for your kindness.BarbaraLorenc Constructionmatthew_g ratedWe contracted Lorenc to remodel our bathroom based on the comments here and are very pleased with his work.  Lorenc is reliable, considerate and hardworking.  A perfectionist.  The remodeling included tearing up old tiles and concrete, and installing a tub, shower fixtures, sinks, vanity and lights.  Lorenc also provided an access panel to the plumbing, painted the bathroom and corrected uneven studs in the wall.   He’s a skilled craftsman who takes a pride in his work.  We highly recommend Lorenc and will hire him again for future projects.  Lorenc Constructionpalletsplus ratedLorenc is an experienced contractor who is professional and knows what he is doing.  He takes great pride in his work.  I had the pleasure of meeting with Lorenc while trying to sell my home.  We were pressed for time and with a long list of things to fix for the sale to happen.  He took the list and said not to worry. He worked independantlygetting everything done in a few days. He was very fair with his prices. I would recommend Lorenc to anyone looking for any type of home remodeling. This guy does it all......Demcomtheresq ratedI love the work DemCom did for...I love the work DemCom did for me.  I had them renovate my Bathroom and put chair rails in for my Mother.  They were extremely reliable and always on time.  My Mother would not be able to be living a normal life if it was not for them.   The work is beautiful and I am extremely happy with it.  I do not know how we could even be talking about the same company with these reviews that have been posted.  I do not have ONE complaint and for sure if I did I would say it!!!  Thank You, Demcom Contractors.Lorenc Constructiondeuss ratedLorenc is a very talented cont...Lorenc is a very talented contractor.  I hired him this summer for my rental property and he did a amazing job doing electrical, floors, tile, plumbing etc.!  I then brought him back for my recent home purchase in Bucks County.

With detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house, an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online. But even with all of this information, there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most DIY enthusiasts. General contractors are there to fill in this gap.A general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish. To do this, the contractor works with the client - whether they are a homeowner or business - to nail down the scope of the work. Then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks, like equipment operation, design, electrical work or whatever else is needed.In essence, general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists. To get their money's worth, many assume they should just "cut out the middleman" and hire specialists directly, but this often proves more difficult in practice. General contractors won't be completing an entire project by themselves, but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task. They might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project, overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed. For larger projects, though, the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for on-site supervision.Common JobsThere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves. There is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home, for example. But general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom, build an in-ground pool or complete a major landscaping project. They could also work with a business to add or improve office space, whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant. Basically, if it's a job that involves building or repairing, a general contractor probably knows how to get it done.No matter what the exact job may be, a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal, which may include:Understanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsOrganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectGathering all the necessary tools and equipment, from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorsSecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursWorking with personnel on-site to address any issuesKeeping records of materials, labor and all other expensesLicensingEvery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state. The guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state. Some states might only require registration of contractors, which is different from licensing. Registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom, but it does not guarantee professional knowledge. Licensing, on the other hand, involves an examination process to assess professional competence.Whether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors, there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area. Check your state or county website for more information. In states that require licensing, every licensed contractor's contact information is available online or from another public source.Not every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor. If it's just a minor job that won't take more than a day or two, and will cost less than a few hundred dollars, it's likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor. However, anything bigger or more expensive, or a project involving plumbing or electrical work, needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professional.General contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy. This should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job. It should also include a worker's compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job. Before hiring a contractor for anything, ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered. Trade AssociationsA number of trade associations for contractors in the U.S. exist. Some of the biggest include:Associated General Contractors of America: Represents more than 6,500 general contracting firms and more than 9,000 specialty contractors nationwide.Associated Builders and Contractors: Represents non-union contracting firms.Most trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project. They may also provide a number of benefits for their members, including assistance with licensing, training, insurance and business development.Hiring a General ContractorNo matter what you need accomplished, you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractor.Finding general contractorsThe first, and perhaps most reliable, way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation. If you know anyone who has had major work done on their home, particularly if it's a similar job, ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result. You could also ask neighbors about who they've hired if you notice work being done on their house. Many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services. As a general rule, it's rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to door.If you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation, ask the contractor for references from past clients, and do as much background research on them as possible. Look for any complaints (or compliments) online to get a better idea of their track record. There are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done. These sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor. BudgetBefore hiring a contractor, make sure you are both in agreement on the project's budget. It's normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise, but for acquiring the materials as well. Be as clear and concise as possible regarding what you'll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete. Homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly, but they first need to be sure they aren't buying the wrong things.Don't forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup. Plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing. An experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area. Even so, talk with the contractor about the daily schedule, the logistics of transporting workers and equipment, and how cleanup will be handled.Prioritizing SafetyAs previously mentioned, you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work, which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor. Ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything, as well as their proof of insurance. You should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work. You may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and won't cover.Perhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust. This is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important, and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind. If you aren't able to obtain a reference, work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform. This should bring everyone's expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environment.Financial safetyBefore any money changes hands, there should be a contract to sign. Make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract, right down to the most precise details. If you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it, there's rarely a chance of recourse. Once the specifics of the job are nailed down, be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor. This is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications. Try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor, such as paying 10 percent of the total cost for each 10 percent of the work that is completed. It's a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as well.Finally, look into getting a lien release signed before work begins. If there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project, a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim, or lien, on your property. This can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating. To avoid this, ask the contractor to sign a lien release, which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final. This can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors. Signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered. A lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor, as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been met.Once work is underway, it's never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job, either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person. If you work with a trustworthy professional, it's probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy. If you want to keep an eye on things, make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule. Finally, once work is finished and you are satisfied, be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience.
