												Michael James Barnes
											

With almost 20 years of experience in the origination and securitization of residential and commercial mortgages, Michael J. Barnes serves as president of Velocity Financial, LLC, a Scottsdale-based company that specializes in providing a variety of mortgage products to individuals and corporate entities.

As President, Mr. Barnes is responsible for the day-to-day operation of Velocity Financial and supervision of the company’s staff.  He is in charge of product and new business development; overseeing the applicant screening process; market analysis; state licensing procedures and regulations; lender relations; and closings and funding mortgage loans.

Prior to opening Velocity Financial in August 2006, Barnes served as President of RG Capital Equity Lending, LLC where he started a mortgage bank for RG Capital Investments.  Prior to that, he was Vice President of Spectrum Financial Group, Inc., where he supervised 35 mortgage professionals.

While at Spectrum Financial, Michael proved to be a valuable asset to the company by tripling branch loan closings; increasing the number of loan officers by 200 percent; creating a cost plan that saved the company more than $500,000 annually; and substantially increasing loan officer revenue without affecting the company’s profitability.  

He has spoken internationally on Mortgage Finance, administered realtor training classes and developed a number of programs that increased customer loyalty.

In 2006, Michael earned his Certified Mortgage Planner (CMP), Certified Mortgage Planning Specialist(CMPS), and Certified Mortgage Advisor (CMA) designations.  The CMPS designation is held by less than 180 Mortgage Planners/Loan Officers in the State of Arizona.

A member of the National Mortgage Lenders Associations and the Arizona Mortgage Lenders Associations, Michael and his wife, Leslie, reside in north Phoenix with their sons, Chase and MJ and their daughter, Alice.
