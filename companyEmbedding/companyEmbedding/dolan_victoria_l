LOS ANGELES, April 7, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Chicago School of Professional Psychology announced today that Victoria L.

She has lived and worked on four continents (U.S., Latin America, Asia, and Europe). 








"I am pleased to be part of the important work of The Chicago School and lend my experience both to further the school's mission and the delivery of the 2015/2020 Strategic Plan. I am excited to work with my fellow Board Members, the President, and her Cabinet as they make progress on their journey," Dolan stated upon her appointment.

"We are delighted to have Ms. Dolan join our trustees at a time when The Chicago School has much forward momentum for the future. Her solid experience in business operations to achieve global success will be invaluable to our institution," said Michele Nealon-Woods, Psy.D., president of The Chicago School.
