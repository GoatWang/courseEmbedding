October 29, 2014 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the notes issued by Fifth 
      Third Auto Trust 2014-3:
    

      --$218,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$340,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of recently 
      issued Fifth Third Auto Trust (FITAT) transactions exhibiting a weighted 
      average FICO score of 759 with no scores below 650. The pool also 
      benefits from 15 months of seasoning and is diverse from a make/model 
      and geographic perspective.
    

      Extended Term/Used Vehicle Exposure: The pool does include heavy 
      concentrations in loans over five years (77.1%), including those 
      financing used vehicles, which could expose the pool to higher loss 
      severity.
    

      Sufficient CE Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes is 4.25% with a target level of 4.75%. Excess spread is 
      expected to be 1.93%. Under Fitch's analysis, the structure is able to 
      support stressed losses commensurate with the expected ratings. The 
      seasoning adjusted base case loss proxy is 1.00%.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Losses on Fifth Third's auto loan portfolio 
      and recent securitizations have declined significantly from peak levels 
      in 2006 to 2008 due to strong underwriting standards and improved credit 
      quality.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak 
      wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of its base case 
      loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes Fifth 
      Third demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer to service FITAT 2014-3.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES:
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to class A notes of 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minor 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario; however, the class A notes could 
      experience a downgrade of up to one rating category under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 16, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 --Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

It has been 2 months since I got my car with Fifth Third Bank and I am yet to get a statement from them. With my social security I figured my first payment was due two weeks ago but I dont even know my account number! I have tried for DAYS to get a hold of someone but nobody picks up the phone HORRIBLE service. I am trying to pay them and I can't get a hold of them. This should be the easiest way to get a hold of someone...to give them money.

              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

              Consolidate Debt

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Trust Agreement
(2014-2)







Trust Estate and the making of
distributions to the Certificateholders and the
Noteholders.

The Owner Trustee is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the
Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer shall engage in any activity other than in connection with
the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4 Appointment of the

statutory trust and that, for United States federal, state and
local income, franchise and value added tax purposes, (i) for
so long as the Issuer has, or is deemed to have, but a single
beneficial owner, it shall be disregarded as an entity separate
from its single beneficial owner and (ii) if the Issuer has,
or is deemed to have, more than one beneficial owner it shall be
treated as a partnership that is not a “publicly traded
partnership” as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.7704-1 promulgated under the Code, and this
Agreement shall be amended to include such provisions as may be
required under Subchapter K of the Code. The parties hereto agree
that the Issuer will file or cause to be filed annual or other
necessary tax returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
foregoing tax characterization of the Issuer, as applicable, unless
otherwise required by pertinent tax law. No election shall be made
by or on behalf of the Issuer to be classified as an association
taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall
have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the
extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Act with
respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner
Trustee filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the
Statutory Trust Act, such filing hereby being ratified and approved
in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
Statutory Trust Act to the contrary, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business
trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has, in

of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Depositor of each Transaction Document to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Depositor and (ii) do not contravene or constitute
a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation,
(B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a
party or its property is subject (other than violations of such
laws, rules, regulations, indenture or agreements which do not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of any
Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings,
(ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(iii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

Transaction Document to which the Depositor is a party constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor

except

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2014-2)







as such enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable, the
rights of creditors of limited liability companies from time to
time in effect or by general principles of equity or other similar
laws of general application relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There is
no Proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the
Depositor, threatened against the Depositor which, either in any
one instance or in the aggregate, would result in any material
adverse change in the business, operations, financial condition,
properties or assets of the Depositor, or in any material
impairment of the right or ability of the Depositor to carry on its
business substantially as now conducted, or in any material
liability on the part of the Depositor, or which would render
invalid this Agreement or the Receivables or the obligations of the
Depositor contemplated herein, or which would materially impair the
ability of the Depositor to perform under the terms of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(f) Situs of Issuer . The
Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

ARTICLE III

for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor may treat the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered (as of the applicable Record
Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever and unless the Certificate Register is notified of such
change in ownership the only available recourse such transferee

which the owner exercises sole investment discretion or for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A;

(ii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates will bear the applicable legends set forth in
Section 3.5(h) ;

(iii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates are being offered only in a transaction not
involving any public offering in the United States within the
meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates have been

Agreement and the applicable legend on such Certificates set forth
below;

in order to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that the

capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of its investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and
any accounts for which it is acting are each able to bear the
economic risk of the holder’s or of its
investment;

(v) such transferee will not offer,
transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the Certificates or
any interest in the Certificates to any Person in any manner, or
solicit any offer to buy, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of
the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates from any
Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by means of
general advertising or in any other manner, or take any other
action that would constitute a distribution of the Certificates
under the Securities Act or that would render the disposition of
the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its
behalf, in such manner with respect to the Certificates;

(vi) the Owner Trustee and the
Issuer determine (based on the advice of counsel or such other
information as they deem necessary or advisable) that the transfer
complies with the requirements of clauses (d)  and
(f)  of this Section 3.5 ;

(vii) such Certificate may not be
acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law;

(viii) unless such transferee is an
Affiliate of the Depositor, the transferee provides a Certificate

warranties or agreements made by it in connection with its purchase
of the Certificates are no longer accurate, the transferee will
promptly notify the Issuer and the Owner Trustee.

Each Certificateholder will
represent and warrant that it is not (and will not be) a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law and is not (and will not be) accepting
or holding such Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with assets of a Benefit Plan or a governmental, non-U.S. or
church plan which is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee

in clause (vi)  above is met and shall incur no
liability to any Person in the event the Certificateholder does not
comply with such restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions
contained herein and in the Certificates, any Certificateholder may
transfer all or any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by
such Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee
accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such
transfer may be made by a registered Certificateholder in person or
by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the
Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written
instrument of

transfer in the form of the
“Assignment” attached to the Form of Certificate
attached hereto as Exhibit A and with such signature
guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the
instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require;
provided , however , that the Owner Trustee
shall not require the signature of the Depositor to be medallion
guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to any applicable
transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed direction
letter regarding registration of such transfer in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D , and (c) the documents required by
Sections 3.5(a)(viii) and 3.5(f) hereof. Promptly
upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee
of the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall
record the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its
Percentage Interest in the Certificate Register and issue, execute
and deliver to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such
Percentage Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a
portion of its Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall
register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing
such transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue,
execute and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing
such transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each
transfer of beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and
destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever
(other than for purposes of clauses (d)  and (e)
 of this Section 3.5 ), the Person in whose name
any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless the
transferee has certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer
does not violate any of the transfer restrictions stated herein
including, but not limited to clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 . The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any
transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer (or purported
transfer) of all or any part of a Certificateholder’s
interest (or any economic interest therein), whether to another
Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder,
shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer)
shall be void ab initio , and no person shall
otherwise become a Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or
purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or
indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates. For purposes
of determining whether the Issuer will have more than 95 holders of
an interest in the Certificates, each Person indirectly owning an
interest through a partnership (including any entity treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes), a
grantor trust or an S corporation (each such entity, a “
flow-through entity ”) shall be treated as a
Certificateholder, as applicable, unless the Depositor determines
in its sole and absolute discretion, after consulting with
qualified tax counsel, that less than substantially all of the
value of the beneficial owner’s interest in the flow-through
entity is attributable to the flow-through entity’s interest
(direct or indirect) in the Issuer.

(e) No transfer shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of Code section 7704 and any proposed, temporary
or final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(f) Each transferee (i) shall
be required to represent and warrant that it is a United States Tax
Person and (ii) shall provide a certification of non-foreign
status, in such form as may be requested by the Seller or the Owner
Trustee (e.g., IRS Form W-9), signed under penalties of
perjury (and such other certification, representations or opinion
of counsel as may be requested by the Seller or the Owner
Trustee).

(g) If a Responsible Officer of the
Owner Trustee becomes aware that (1) a transfer or attempted
or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest therein was
consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.5 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee failed to deliver to the Owner Trustee the
certificate required to be delivered under
Section 3.5(a)(viii) or (3) the Certificateholder
of any Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will direct the Certificate Registrar not to register
such attempted or purported transfer and, if a transfer has been
registered, such transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab
initio and shall not operate to transfer any rights to the
purported transferee (such purported transferee, a “
Disqualified Transferee ”) and the last preceding
Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that was not a
Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights as a
Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(h) Each Certificate will bear a
legend to the following effect:

“THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”) OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS CERTIFICATE, AGREES THAT THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS AND ONLY PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”) TO A PERSON THAT THE
HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER
WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A (A “QIB”), PURCHASING
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB, WHOM THE HOLDER HAS
INFORMED THAT THE REOFFER, RESALE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A.”

SECTION 3.6 Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity on behalf of the Issuer

Trust Agreement
(2014-2)






as may be requested by the Owner Trustee to save
it harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Owner Trustee
that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser,
the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for
the same Percentage Interest in the Issuer as the Certificate so
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a
different issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner
Trustee shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate
under this Section 3.6 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with
any transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other
reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Issuer and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. If, after
the delivery of such new Certificate a protected purchaser of the
original Certificate in lieu of which such new Certificate was
issued presents such original Certificate for transfer or payment,
the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be entitled to recover such new
Certificate from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person
taking title therefrom, except a protected purchaser, and the
Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be entitled to recover upon the
security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss,
damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer and Owner Trustee,
in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant
to this Section 3.6 shall constitute complete and
indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally
issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
shall be found at any time. The provisions of this
Section 3.6 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or
stolen Certificates.

SECTION 3.7 Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . At any time that a Certificate
Distribution Account exists, having been established in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.5 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer. Any Certificate Paying Agent shall have the revocable
power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account
for the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The
Owner Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Certificate
Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its sole discretion
that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be Wilmington Trust,
National Association, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Certificate Paying Agent. Wilmington Trust, National Association
shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying Agent upon
thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Owner Trustee.
If Wilmington Trust, National Association shall no longer be the
Certificate Paying Agent, the Administrator shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or a trust company). The Administrator shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Administrator to execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee a written agreement in which such successor Certificate
Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent, such
successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. Subject to applicable laws with respect
to the escheat of funds, the Certificate Paying Agent shall return
all funds that have remained unclaimed by a Certificateholder for
two (2) years to the Owner Trustee. Immediately upon
its

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2014-2)






removal, a Certificate Paying Agent shall return
all funds (including any unclaimed funds) in its possession to the
Owner Trustee. The rights, protections and indemnities of the Owner
Trustee under Article VII and Section 8.2 and
9.2 of this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also
in its role as Certificate Paying Agent for so long as the Owner
Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent and, to the extent
applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any
reference in this Agreement to the Certificate Paying Agent shall
include any co-paying agent unless the context requires
otherwise.

SECTION 3.8 Maintenance of Office
or Agency . As long as any of the Certificates remain
Outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain at the applicable Corporate
Trust Office, an office or agency where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where
notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the
Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The Issuer hereby
initially appoints the Owner Trustee to serve as its agent for the
foregoing purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to
the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
applicable Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints
the Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders,
notices and demands.

Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated
to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5 Acts of
Certificateholders; Majority Control . (a) Any request,

SECTION 4.6 Compliance with the

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN
DUTIES

SECTION 5.1 Application of Trust
Funds . Deposits into the Certificate Distribution Account
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture
and this Agreement. On each Payment Date, after a Certificate
Distribution Account has been established in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Certificate Paying Agent shall withdraw
from the Certificate Distribution Account and distribute to the
Certificateholders, pro rata based on the Percentage Interest of
each Certificateholder, all funds received in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture and this Agreement. Subject to the lien
of the Indenture, the Certificate Paying Agent shall promptly
distribute to the Certificateholders all other amounts (if any)
received by the Certificate Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer in
respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata based on the Percentage
Interest of each such Certificateholder). After the termination of
the Indenture in accordance with its terms, the Certificate Paying
Agent shall distribute all amounts received (if any) by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If any
withholding tax is imposed on any Issuer payment to, or is imposed
on any allocable Issuer income of, a Certificateholder, such tax
shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the
Certificateholder in accordance with this Section 5.1 ;
provided , that , the Owner Trustee shall not have an
obligation to withhold any such amount if and for so long as the
Depositor is the sole Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee is
hereby authorized and directed to withhold from amounts otherwise
allocable or distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient
funds for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Issuer
(but such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee from
contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and withholding
payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of
such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with
respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed
to such Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Issuer
and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a
distribution or income allocation, the Owner Trustee may in its
sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with this
Section 5.1 . If a Certificateholder wishes to apply
for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall
reasonably cooperate with such Certificateholder in making such
claim so long as such Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the
Owner Trustee for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

SECTION 5.2 Sarbanes-Oxley
Act . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
Transaction Document, the Owner Trustee shall not be required to
execute, deliver or certify in accordance with the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on behalf of the Issuer or
 












 



13


 


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2014-2)






any other Person, any periodic reports filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act, or any other documents pursuant to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

SECTION 5.3 Signature on
Returns . The Owner Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and shall sign, on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder to sign such documents. In the event that the
Issuer is required to be treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes, the Certificateholder that is a United
States Tax Person holding the largest Certificate Percentage
Interest shall be designated the “tax matters partner”
of the Issuer pursuant to Code section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code
and shall sign the tax return of the Issuer. In the event that two
or more Certificateholders would be described in the preceding
sentence then Certificateholder with the alphabetically first name
shall be so designated.

SECTION 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall (a) maintain (or cause to
be maintained) the books of the Issuer on a calendar year basis and
the accrual method of accounting, (b) deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to each Certificateholder, as may be required by the
Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, such information as may
be required (including, if applicable, Schedule K-1) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax
returns, (c) prepare (or cause to be prepared), file (or cause
to be filed) such tax returns relating to the Issuer (including, if
applicable, a partnership information return, IRS Form 1065 if the
Issuer is treated as a partnership for United States federal income
tax purposes) and make such elections as from time to time may be
required or appropriate under any applicable state or federal
statute or any rule or regulation thereunder so as to maintain the
Issuer’s applicable tax characterization as described in
Section 2.6 hereof, (d) cause applicable tax
returns to be signed in the manner required by law and
(e) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as
described in and in accordance with Section 5.1 with
respect to income or distributions to
Certificateholders.

SECTION 5.5 Method of Payment
. Subject to the Indenture, distributions required to be made to a
Certificateholder on any Payment Date and all amounts received by
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee on any other date that are payable
to a Certificateholder pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document shall be made to such Certificateholder by
wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of
such Certificateholder designated by such Certificateholder to the
Owner Trustee in writing.

SECTION 5.6 Certificate
Distribution Account . A Certificate Distribution Account shall
be established pursuant to and solely to the extent required by
Section 8.2 of the Indenture. The Certificateholders
shall possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in such Certificate Distribution Account
and all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein or in
the Indenture, such Certificate Distribution Account shall be under
the sole dominion and control of the Certificate Paying Agent for
the benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time, such
Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Account,
the Owner Trustee (or the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee,
if such Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the
Owner Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall within ten
(10) Business Days establish a new Certificate Distribution
Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any

time to take such action as the Depositor, the Administrator or a
Majority of the Certificateholders recommends or directs in writing

that this Agreement expressly requires the consent of each
Certificateholder for such action.

It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to discharge
(or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to administer the Issuer in the interest of the
Certificateholders, subject to Transaction Documents, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged

Trustee in the management of the Issuer. Such
direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of
the Certificateholders pursuant to Article IV
.

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner
Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of
facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form
as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of
action to be adopted or application of such provision, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Majority
Certificateholders (or, if specifically required, all
Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
(10) days of such notice (or within such shorter period of
time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be
necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no
duty to, take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent
with this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as it shall deem
to be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, and shall
have no liability to any Person for such action or
inaction.

(d) The Owner Trustee shall be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it
by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation, at the request, order or direction of any

Certificateholder or such Person has offered to the Owner Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner Trustee
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel) therein or thereby, including such advances as the
Owner Trustee shall reasonably request.

(e) The Owner Trustee shall not be
personally liable for any distribution made in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 9.1(c) .

ARTICLE VII

Certificateholders; provided , that the Owner Trustee may
elect not to afford the requesting Certificateholders access to the
list of Certificateholders if it agrees to mail the desired
communication or proxy, on behalf of and at the expense of the
requesting Certificateholders, to all Certificateholders. Each
Certificateholder, by receiving and holding a Certificate,
shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Owner Trustee

address, regardless of the source from which such information was
derived.

Certificateholders . (a) The Owner Trustee shall promptly
