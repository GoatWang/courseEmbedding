Material Impact Fund led a $5 million Series A funding round in robotics startup Soft Robotics Inc. Other investors in the funding included Haiyin Capital and Taylor Ventures.
Press Release
Soft Robotics Incorporated, an early-stage startup focused on robotic manipulation and material handling announced today that it has closed the first tranche of a $5M Series A investment round. The investment was led by Material Impact Fund, an early-stage venture capital firm, and joined by Haiyin Capital and Taylor Ventures.
“Soft Robotics has leveraged their proprietary technology to develop a solution that addresses the critical need of adaptability in robotics. Their technology brings automated solutions to completely new markets,” said Carmichael Roberts of Material Impact Fund. “What the team has developed and brought to market over the last two years is impressive, and we’re excited to see its continued impact on the rapidly-growing global robotics market.”
Soft Robotics brought their disruptive technology to market in June 2015 and is deploying robotic solutions with industry-leading partners and end users in the consumer products, advanced manufacturing and food handling industries. This financing will enable rapid growth and widespread commercial deployment of Soft Robotics’ proprietary technology while supporting continued product development.
“We’re excited to have investment partners who bring much more than capital to the company,” said Carl Vause, CEO of Soft Robotics. “China is the fastest growing robotics market in the world and we’re proud to work with Haiyin Capital as we expand geographically. Having Taylor Farms on board brings world class leadership and expertise in the produce industry, where we are currently deploying systems to meet the growing demand for process automation.”
Founded in 2013 out of the Whitesides Research Group at Harvard University, Soft Robotics is enabling a new level of robotic adaptability with its novel and proprietary technology. A single end-of-arm tool can now handle an unprecedented range of objects without the need for tool changes or software modifications between cycles. Soft Robotics has demonstrated the ability to grasp fresh produce, electronic components, consumer goods, and clothing, among other objects, all with a single device. This disruptive capability addresses unmet needs in existing markets and unlocks new markets for cost-effective automated solutions.

Environmental Justice In Ohio: East Liverpool Residents' Battle For Clean Air

At Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, we've had our share of uphill battles. Fair Shake uses a sliding scale to charge for its services, so many of our clients are of modest means, and they're often facing corporations with a phalanx of lawyers.It's so easy—clichéd—to lump such matters into another David v. Goliath story. But that reduces these cases to…well, to something other than people. We represent people, not cases. Besides, neither David nor Goliath had to live next to a waste incinerator plant. Others—specifically people in East Liverpool, Ohio—were not so lucky.

One leaves the Garden Island wondering why the people of this breathtakingly beautiful island need to play Russian roulette and hope they don’t become a statistic in a cancer cluster when people in the countries where these companies are headquartered live by the precautionary principle. Switzerland, home of Syngenta, has banned the use of the very chemicals that continue to drench the soil of the Garden island.

President Trump may have stated from his federal perch that the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Accords, but on the domestic stage, our efforts to uphold these goals and regulations are far from undone. It appears that by withdrawing from the Paris Accords, President Trump strengthened the resolve of climate leaders within the United States and weakened his own ability to participate in one of the largest opportunities to create jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy, and ensure the existence of a viable environment.

For a decade now, the Impact Fund Training Institute has served as a catalyst for thoughtful and thorough class action litigation. Over the past ten years we have trained over 250 attorneys giving them the knowledge and foundation they need to advance justice in the United States. The conference has assisted in bridging the gap between private firms and nonprofit organizations by highlighting opportunities for collaboration.Institute alumnus, Jacob Bell, sat down with us recently to share his experience and reflect on the value of the training institute to him.

The Third Circuit handed down an opinion last Monday holding that a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) confers Article III standing even in the case of intangible injuries.The opinion may prove to be less interesting for its impact on TCPA jurisprudence than for guiding courts in their efforts to understand and apply the Supreme Court’s Spokeo decision.  After all, within the TCPA context, there already appears to be a consensus that statutory violations satisfy Article III’s requirements.

Comment





While the Microsoft case is a clear victory for corporate defendants, there is some language in the opinion that may be useful in another important fight in a different venue. H.R. 985, the anti-class action bill passed earlier this year by the House, would permit an interlocutory appeal from every class certification order. The high court’s opinion strongly endorsed a contrary perspective – it highlighted the wisdom of Rule 23(f)’s “careful calibration” of the question as well as the preference for determining such issues through rulemaking rather than legislation. Senate Judiciary Committee, are you listening?

But don't take our word for it




























"PitchBook data shows who the investors, founders, and other key players are of start-ups and venture capital firms. As simple as this may seem, it's not information that's widely avaliable - espcially not all in one place!"
