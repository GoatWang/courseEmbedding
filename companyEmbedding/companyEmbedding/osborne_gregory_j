      	By SCOTT SUTTELL



            
            
            There's a new Osborne in the CEO seat at Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT: EGAS) of Mentor.Gas Natural, a holding company that operates natural gas utility companies serving 73,000 customers in seven states, announced Thursday, May 15, that its board of directors appointed Gregory J. Osborne as CEO, effective immediately.On May 1, Richard M. Osborne, the company's CEO and chairman of the board of directors, and the father of Gregory J. Osborne, stepped down from those roles. Richard Osborne continues as a member of the board of directors of Gas Natural.Gregory Osborne, 35, is a director of Gas Natural and has served as its president and chief operating officer since November 2013. Prior to that, he served as president and COO of Energy West Resources Inc., Gas Natural's marketing and production subsidiary, beginning in February 2012. He also has been a vice president of Orwell Natural Gas Co. and has served as a trustee of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.      W.E. “Gene” Argo, Gas Natural's chairman, said in a statement, “Since his appointment as our president and COO in November, Gregory has demonstrated acute vision and leadership, industry knowledge and the ability to execute against the vision that will guide our company to its next level.”Gregory Osborne, who also retains the president role at Gas Natural, said in a statement, “We have excellent assets and are well positioned to bring the benefits of cost-effective and reliable natural gas to a growing customer base. We are instilling a culture of high standards, personal responsibility and change, and we are working closely with our regulatory commissions.”Last November, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ordered an investigative audit of two subsidiaries of Gas Natural and all related companies, citing concerns about the companies' internal controls, the propriety of their executive compensation system and alleged self-dealing by management.Crain's reported in April that the company in recent months “has made changes to its procedures and internal controls, retained a firm to consult it on regulatory matters, made four hires to improve its reporting and underwent PUCO training.”When Richard Osborne stepped down on May 1, Gas Natural said in a news release that company officials and Osborne were “in discussions concerning a severance arrangement.” The company at the time said it will “announce the terms of any agreement if and when reached.” The May 15 announcement about Gregory Osborne made no reference to a severance arrangement with Richard Osborne.Richard Osborne is in the process of selling more than 200 properties — most of them in Lake County — that will be for sale as part of a proposed agreement to settle debts that he and his business entities owe to RBS Citizens.

Gas Natural Inc. Highlights Richard M. Osborne's Regulatory And Legal Struggles In Letter To Shareholders






GlobeNewswire



Jun 30, 2016 5:52 PM EDT













 




























































     Adding Richard M. Osborne to the Board would likely present additional costly regulatory challenges for Gas Natural     Richard M. Osborne and Darryl L. Knight are stealing customers, according to Gas Natural, and jeopardizing the safety of the public     Urging shareholders to vote "FOR" the Gas Natural Director nominees on the GREEN proxy card     CLEVELAND, June 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT:EGAS) (the "Company"), a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately 68,000 customers in four states, announced that it is mailing a letter to shareholders in connection with the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on July 27, 2016.  Gas Natural shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27, 2016 are entitled to vote at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Gas Natural Board of Directors strongly recommends that shareholders vote on the GREEN proxy card "FOR" all six of Gas Natural's qualified and experienced director nominees:  Michael B. Bender, James P. Carney, Richard K. Greaves, Robert B. Johnston, Gregory J. Osborne and Michael R. Winter. This letter and other materials regarding the Board's recommendation for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders can be found at http://proxy.egas.net. The full text of the letter follows: June 30, 2016   Dear Fellow Shareholder,    Your vote is especially important at this year's annual meeting of shareholders.  Richard M. Osborne, who was fired by your board as chairman and CEO of Gas Natural on May 1, 2014, has nominated a slate of six candidates (including himself) for election as directors. After his removal, Richard Osborne retaliated by filing numerous lawsuits against Gas Natural and our officers and directors (our full proxy statement contains additional information regarding these pending cases) and is illegally stealing customers from our Ohio utilities. Now, after selling almost all of his remaining Gas Natural stock — he and his other nominees own less than 0.1% of our stock — he is seeking to regain control of your board. You may have received a proxy statement, white proxy card and other solicitation materials from the self-proclaimed "Committee to Re-Energize Gas Natural" which was formed by Richard Osborne.
