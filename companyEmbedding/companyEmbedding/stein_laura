"I've been looking a long, long time for just the perfect shoe!  When I saw the Laura Pump, I thought it was the one!  When the Laura Pump arrived, I knew it was the one!  It is chic in every aspect from the stylish heel--not too high--to the adorable open toe--and, it is very comfortable, too!    "

"This is my 3rd pair of these amazing pumps.  They are so comfortable and look great with skinny jeans or work clothing."

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Toronto, ON professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Toronto, ON portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Toronto, ON professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in Toronto

What does an interior designer do?A good home design professional will hone your style down to its very essence and be able to choose a functional layout that feels natural to you. Interior design companies can be involved as much or as little as the client desires. Many clients who hire an interior decorator in Toronto, ON — particularly those who are remodeling — have a good sense of how the room should look and what products they should use. Often clients will insist that interior decorators use the products already present in the house. Other times a designer will need to start from scratch — especially if this is a newly purchased or just-built home. An interior design company will need to figure out exactly what the client needs, which includes organizing rooms, picking flooring and wall colors, and finding furniture to complement it all. Sometimes that means he or she will have to recruit help from other Toronto, ON home professionals to help create the perfect look for your renovation.
