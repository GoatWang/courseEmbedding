ALBANY, N.Y., Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AMRI (NASDAQ:   AMRI) is pleased to announce that it has appointed Christopher Conway as Senior Vice President of Discovery and Development and Global Commercial Sales. Mr. Conway will head up the Company's global Discovery and Development Services (DDS) business, and will retain responsibility for corporate sales and marketing. Chris succeeds Michael A. Luther, Ph.D., MBA, who is leaving AMRI to pursue other opportunities.
"Chris is the ideal choice to direct the next phase of AMRI's DDS growth and development," said William S. Marth, president and CEO, AMRI. "Chris brings deep knowledge of AMRI's discovery and development operations and strong commercial sales and marketing experience to the role. Since joining AMRI in 2008, Chris has consistently demonstrated his commercial and strategic leadership abilities generating value for AMRI's customers while driving top and bottom line growth across all of AMRI's business units in Discovery, Development, API, and Drug Product. We thank Dr. Luther for his efforts in moving the DDS business forward during the last two years and wish him the best in his future endeavors."
Mr. Conway joined AMRI in 2008 as a Business Development Manager with AMRI's U.S. discovery team. He was promoted to Senior Director of the North America discovery market in 2010 and then to Vice President of Business Development in 2012 leading an international team of business development managers in North America and Europe. Chris was promoted to Senior Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing in 2014. Before joining AMRI, Mr. Conway held sales and leadership positions of increasing responsibility at Johnson and Johnson and completed J&J's Commercial Leadership Development Program. 
In a related announcement, AMRI welcomes Rory Curtis, Ph.D., who joins AMRI as Vice President of Discovery Biology and Pharmacology.

Prior to that, he was Senior Director of Research at Elixir Pharmaceuticals, where he built a drug discovery platform developing small molecules to target diseases of aging. Prior to that, Dr. Curtis held positions of increasing responsibility at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, focused on the discovery of novel genes as drug targets and developing high-throughput screens.

We especially appreciate the way the community rallies around each other. Whether it’s a family or an organization, the people here are willing to give a helping hand. It was a great place to raise our daughter. Aside from great people that surround us, the development of new restaurants and shopping options make Conway an even better place to live. 
Giving back to the community is important to me, which is why I participate in a number of local organizations. I serve as a board member for City of Hope Outreach (CoHO). CoHO helps with community renewal with a focus on education, housing and community development. I’m also a part of the neighborhood task force:  Community Relations Committee, in addition to, being an active member of the Conway Area Chamber of Commerce. Our agency has been afforded the opportunity to give back to: Young Empowered Sisters and The Distinguished Gentleman’s Club through our Allstate Foundation. These organizations support the efforts of our community’s youth becoming productive citizens and leaders. In my spare time and on the weekends I enjoy playing basketball, going to the movies and reading.  
My passion for helping people is what lead me to become an Allstate agent in 2016. It’s my desire to educate my community about the importance of helping protect what’s important to them. That’s the best part of being an agent – meeting new people. Everyone has their own story and I love hearing them. Come stop by and say hello.

This may mean that you pay for expenses such as property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums as part of your monthly mortgage payment. Then, typically, your mortgage lender will use the escrow funds to pay those other expenses on your behalf. This kind of account can help you budget for these bills, which you may otherwise pay on your own once or twice a year.Learn More After A Car AccidentMost people don't want to think about getting into an accident, but it's a reality many of us will have to deal with at some point. I know that a car accident can be frightening, but you can help reduce some of the stress by knowing what to do ahead of time. Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More What is Event Liability Insurance?Whether it's a wedding, a sweet 16, a golden anniversary or a baby shower, life's milestones often come with a celebration. You've probably spent a lot of time planning every detail for your special event, but sometimes things happen that you just can't predict. For instance, what if you or your guests damage a reception hall or accidentally injure someone during the event? Learn how event liability insurance may help if your event doesn't go exactly as planned.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Conway.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(501) 336-0427(501) 336-0427Email:chrishervey@allstate.comchrishervey@allstate.comAddress:1214 Hogan Ln, Ste 100Conway, AR 72034Get DirectionsLandmarks:Our office is located on 1214 Hogan Lane right beside Brookdale Senior LivingAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Conway, Greenbrier, Little Rock.

What's the Difference Between Term and Permanent Life Insurance?Why It Pays to Build Your Retirement Account NowPlan Your Financial Future.Buy vs. Lease CalculatorMortgage Tax Credit CalculatorLife insurance policies typically fall into two categories: term or permanent insurance. Which type of policy is right for you?See how much you need to save to help reach your retirement goal—and what it could cost if you put off saving.New Family? Nearing Retirement? Make sure you're doing all you can to protect the life you deserve—no matter what stage you're at in life.What’s more cost efficient – buying or leasing a car? This calculator can help crunch the numbers.Calculate your potential average yearly tax savings over the life of your mortgage.Learn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn moreLearn more     Protect What Matters MostWhether it's your home, your family, your bike or your boat, see how Allstate can help protect the things that matter most to you in life.Homeowners Insurance and EscrowIf you own a home, you may be required to open an escrow account. This may mean that you pay for expenses such as property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums as part of your monthly mortgage payment. Then, typically, your mortgage lender will use the escrow funds to pay those other expenses on your behalf. This kind of account can help you budget for these bills, which you may otherwise pay on your own once or twice a year.Learn More After A Car AccidentMost people don't want to think about getting into an accident, but it's a reality many of us will have to deal with at some point. I know that a car accident can be frightening, but you can help reduce some of the stress by knowing what to do ahead of time. Remember to always keep current proof of insurance in the car, and follow these tips about your personal safety, documenting the accident and beginning the claims process.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More What is Event Liability Insurance?Whether it's a wedding, a sweet 16, a golden anniversary or a baby shower, life's milestones often come with a celebration. You've probably spent a lot of time planning every detail for your special event, but sometimes things happen that you just can't predict. For instance, what if you or your guests damage a reception hall or accidentally injure someone during the event? Learn how event liability insurance may help if your event doesn't go exactly as planned.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Christopher Hervey is insurance licensed in the state(s) of Arkansas.

Chris got his start in product at comparison site NexTag and then at Trulia, where he joined as an early employee in 2007. He and his family are in the market for a house (and a mortgage) themselves right now. Chris joined Sindeo to create a transparent, frictionless mortgage experience that helps people focus on what matters – their home.
