about  stella james organic clothing
stella james was born  out of a passion for knitwear and
                an  interest in organic and ethical clothing. Recognising that
                people  are increasingly looking for products that are made
                in an environmentally  friendly way, and after many years
                of  working for manufacturers and high street retailers, we
                decided to go it alone. The idea for stella james was born
                and our  hand knitted organic clothing collection was created 
                using the  best certified organic yarns which have been 
                sourced  and produced ethically. 









Stuart Welsh and Stella Claxton




why wear organic clothing?
                    All the items in the collections are created from organic yarns that not only offer certified environmental benefits but will also stand the test of time. The majority of our organic cotton, and all of our organic merino wool yarns are produced without chemicals, pesticides or dyestuffs. The colour you see is ‘grown in’ and natural which means it won’t fade. The fabrics are soft and comfortable and can be worn next to the skin of even the most delicate babies and toddlers, while at the same time giving a durable fabric which will endure numerous washes.
FAQs about our organic cotton and organic merino wool products
the organic clothing collection
                  The collection of organic baby and toddler clothes, home furnishings and accessories uses vintage inspired designs and traditional methods to create the textured stitches and patterns. Each piece in our organic clothing collection is unique because it’s hand made by skilled craftspeople. We work directly with our organic yarn suppliers and garment producers, supporting ethical trade, and investing into traditional textile craft skills.
new dyed cotton colours
                In response to customer demand we’ve now added some lovely new dyed cotton colours to the collection. Using GOTS certified organic yarns that are dyed to environmentally controlled standards, the new shades of denim blue, charcoal, rose pink, and aqua add a new dimension to the range and offer even more choice for your little ones.              

                The stella james organic clothing knitwear collection is designed to be both luxurious and functional, and we hope our products will provide much enjoyment and pleasure for you and your family.

what our customers say
“I can’t tell you how grateful I am  to finally have a fabric Archie can wear against his skin without causing a  major allergic reaction. The merino fabric is so soft and feels so luxurious –  but more importantly washes so well. Archie has had so many comments saying how  cute he looks – especially in the matching hat – obviously now the most stylish  baby in Scotland.”
                Moira Browning, Blairgowrie, Scotland
“Dear Stella, I am absolutely  delighted with my scarf. It looks beautiful and feels really soft and  comfortable to wear. Are you thinking of adding gloves to go with it, because I  would love a pair to match?”    
  Joanna Bail, Nottingham 
“Just a small note to say thanks for  supplying me with the much needed head warmer in the form of your cable hat,  quickly. Believe me, standing on the side of a rugby pitch can get very  chilly.  I am so grateful to have  something that not only is incredibly practical, the merino is so soft and warm  , but really stylish too.”
                Diane Clay, Rufford, Nottinghamshire
