Abstract
Developing an appropriate brand name entails consideration of how that name will be perceived by the target audience. In this regard, prior research has demonstrated that the use of numbers can affect how consumers perceive the brand. For product categories that are more functionally-oriented, higher numbers tend to suggest better quality and/or performance. For example, the iPhone 5 is likely to be perceived as newer than the iPhone 4 and the Ford F-250 truck is likely to be perceived as bigger than the Ford F-150. For product categories that are more symbolic in nature, however, a lower number may evoke stronger feelings of exclusivity or prestige. Chanel No. 1 would be an example of a brand that elicits both prestige and exclusivity. This study extends prior research in this area by examining the use of numbers in a previously under-researched product category: bicycles. Using a sample of 16 well-established bicycle brands, the results indicate that there is little consensus with half of the brands utilizing ascending numbers and the other half using descending numbers to denote increases in quality/performance. Given the functional nature of bicycles, this inconsistency suggests that the use of ascending versus descending numbers to reflect changes in quality/performance might be more complicated than previously thought. Alternatively, it might suggest that some manufacturers are using sub-optimal numbering to promote their brands.

(more...)A mental defect or disease that makes it impossible for a person to understand the wrongfulness of his acts or, even if he understands them, to ditinguish right from wrong. Defendants who are criminally insane cannot be convicted of a crime, since criminal conduct involves the conscious intent to do wrong -- a choice that the criminally insane cannot meaningfully make. See also irresistible impulse; McNaghten Rule.

(more...)A ruling by a judge, typically made after the plaintiff has presented all of her evidence but before the defendant puts on his case, that awards judgment to the defendant. A directed verdict is usually made because the judge concludes the plaintiff has failed to offer the minimum amount of evidence to prove her case even if there were no opposition. In other words, the judge is saying that, as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could decide in the plaintiff's favor. In a criminal case, a directed verdict is a judgement of acquittal for the defendant.

(more...)A lawyer who is elected to represent a state government in criminal cases in a designated county or judicial district. A D.A.'s duties typically include reviewing police arrest reports, deciding whether to bring criminal charges against arrested people and prosecuting criminal cases in court. The D.A. may also supervise other attorneys, called Deputy District Attorneys or Assistant District Attorneys. In some states a District Attorney may be called a Prosecuting Attorney, County Attorney or State's Attorney. In the federal system, the equivalent to the D.A. is a United States Attorney. The country has many U.S. Attorneys, each appointed by the President, who supervise regional offices staffed with prosecutors called Assistant United States Attorneys.

A plea is usually entered when charges are formally brought (at arraignment).

(more...)Latin for 'we shall no longer prosecute.' At trial, this is an entry made on the record by a prosecutor in a criminal case stating that he will no longer pursue the matter. An entry of nolle prosequi may be made at any time after charges are brought and before a verdict is returned or a plea entered. Essentially, it is an admission on the part of the prosecution that some aspect of its case against the defendant has fallen apart. Most of the time, prosecutors need a judge's A1:C576 to 'nol-pros' a case. (See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48a.) Abbreviated 'nol. pros.' or 'nol-pros.'

(more...)A jury unable to come to a final decision, resulting in a mistrial. Judges do their best to avoid hung juries, typically sending juries back into deliberations with an assurance (sometimes known as a 'dynamite charge') that they will be able to reach a decision if they try harder. If a mistrial is declared, the case is tried again unless the parties settle the case (in a civil case) or the prosecution dismisses the charges or offers a plea bargain (in a criminal case).

(more...)Laws written by Congress and state legislators that make certain behavior illegal and punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. By contrast, civil laws are not punishable by imprisonment. In order to be found guilty of a criminal law, the prosecution must show that the defendant intended to act as he did; in civil law, you may sometimes be responsible for your actions even though you did not intend the consequences. For example, civil law makes you financially responsible for a car accident you caused but didn't intend.
