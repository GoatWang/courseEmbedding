As Seen on Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson) in Pain & Gain


 Athletic Adonis:  					Sweatbands and tank tops have never looked as good as they do in this inspired-by-true-events organized crime comedy with a fitness twist. When the flashy ex-con Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) cooks up an extortion scheme with the help of his screwball gym buddies, including majestic Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson), the boys flaunt the money like rap stars and make a few too many bad decisions, though never fashion-wise. If you're not a bodybuilder, Paul Doyle (The Rock), is going to make you seriously consider switching careers. He's rocking quite the sporty chic ensembles between getting into serious trouble: Air Jordans and Nike shorts to be exact, if you like that kinda thing. Scroll down to see more clothes, outfits and products identified from Pain & Gain.
