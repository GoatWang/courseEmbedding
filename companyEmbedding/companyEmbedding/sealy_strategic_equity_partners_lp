Sealy Strategic Equity Partners, L.P. Acquires 1.48 Million SF 
      Industrial Portfolio Located in Dallas, Texas






August 31, 2016 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sealy & Company, a fully-integrated commercial real estate investment 
      and operating company and recognized leader in the industrial real 
      estate market, is announcing the acquisition of 1.48 million square feet 
      of functional industrial buildings located in 4 prime industrial sub 
      markets in Dallas, TX. The industrial portfolio is comprised of 18 
      buildings occupied by a diverse tenant base. The assets are acquired as 
      part of the Sealy Strategic Equity Partners, L.P. (SSEP) portfolio.
    


      The industrial portfolio represents an excellent opportunity to acquire 
      a critical mass of institutional quality property with significant 
      leasing upside in a Tier 1 industrial market. The properties are located 
      in prime infill locations with significant barriers to entry for new 
      competitive product due to land constraints and rising land values. The 
      portfolio is being acquired at a significant discount to replacement 
      cost and has strong historical occupancy.
    

      “The industrial portfolio acquisition is a fitting addition to the 
      current SSEP portfolio, providing functional properties and further 
      tenant diversification,” stated Scott Sealy Jr., Vice President and 
      Business Development for Sealy & Company. “Sealy will continue to create 
      value by executing a tailored investment strategy, rolling below market 
      rents to market, and will hold or sell the properties opportunistically.”

Sealy Strategic Equity Partners Buys 2.2M SF Industrial Portfolio in Texas, Louisiana
Posted on December 1, 2015  by  Scott Reid  in Top Stories 
The Southwest Properties industrial portfolio consists of 149 buildings located in three markets: Dallas; El Paso, Texas; and New Orleans.DALLAS — Sealy & Co., a sponsor of Sealy Strategic Equity Partners (SSEP), a private equity offering and diversified limited partnership, has purchased Southwest Properties, a 2.23 million-square-foot industrial portfolio.
The portfolio consists of 149 buildings located in three markets: Dallas; El Paso, Texas; and New Orleans.
The seller was an undisclosed fund.
“The Southwest Properties transaction demonstrates the ability of SSEP to capitalize on an opportunity to acquire a critical mass of functional industrial product in three of SSEP’s target markets using our enterprise financing structure,” says Scott Sealy Sr., chairman of the board of Dallas-based Sealy.
“SSEP is positioned to continue to acquire and enhance industrial distribution properties to provide stable, improving portfolio performance and enhance equity value.”
The assets were purchased at a significant discount to replacement cost and are currently 94 occupied.
The Southwest Properties portfolio contains assets that feature an average office finish of 18 percent and are functional with respect to clear height, loading areas, parking and access.
The portfolio consists of two sub-portfolios: the Class B portfolio of 12 traditional warehouses in Texas and Louisiana; and Mustang Creek in Forney, Texas, which consists of two master-planned business parks featuring buildings that are functional for light distribution and service center uses.
The purchase of the portfolio realized gains for Sealy that include a 25 percent increase in square footage to 8.86 million square feet, a 23 percent increase in total asset value up to $380 million and further diversification by tenant type, market and number of tenants.
Sealy is a fully integrated commercial real estate investment and operating company that acquires, develops and redevelops regional distribution warehouse, industrial/flex and other commercial properties.

Scott Sealy Jr., Sealy & Co.
Dallas—Sealy & Co. has acquired an 18-building portfolio consisting of 1.48 million square feet of functional industrial space located in four prime industrial submarkets of Dallas. The assets were acquired as part of the Sealy Strategic Equity Partners LP portfolio.
“The industrial portfolio acquisition is a fitting addition to the current SSEP portfolio, providing functional properties and further tenant diversification,” Scott Sealy Jr., Sealy & Co.’s vice president of business development, said in a prepared release. “Sealy will continue to create value by executing a tailored investment strategy, rolling below market rents to market, and will hold or sell the properties opportunistically.”
According to a recent industrial market report published by Colliers, the Dallas industrial market continues to ride a rising tide of increasing rents and strong demand in the second quarter of 2016, propelling the area to the highest levels of construction in the nation. So far in 2016, over 2.9 million square feet of spec “big box” warehouses have been delivered, and these properties are 55 percent leased.
According to the release from Sealy & Co., the properties it acquired are located in prime infill locations with significant barriers to entry for new competitive product due to land constraints and rising land values, which represented an excellent opportunity for the company to acquire a critical mass of institutional quality property with significant leasing upside in a Tier 1 industrial market.
The portfolio is being acquired at a significant discount to replacement cost and has strong historical occupancy.
