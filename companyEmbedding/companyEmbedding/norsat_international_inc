Defense
Defense organizations are faced with increasing demands to provide real time data to and from the battle field. The reason being – information saves lives.

The informed soldier is an effective soldier. MILSATCOM provides clarity in live theatre which provides clarity to critical decision makers. To meet this demand companies are being called upon to develop more sophisticated communications tools for rapid deployment into the harshest of environments sometimes with special customizable size, weight, power or feature requirements to meet the needs of a specific application.


Temporary Encampment
Secure VIP Communications: The need for secure communications during VIP travel is particularly well supported by portable satellite systems. These systems can be moved around easily. Setup and teardown is simple and communication can be established within minutes of assembly.
MWR (Moral, Welfare, Recereation): Portable satellite systems are often central to enabling military personnel to stay connected by Internet and email service and, where appropriate, through videoconferencing with their friends and families at home. A portable system is able to establish a link as needed and can be redeployed at the end of any mission.
Combat Support Systems
Global Combat Support System (GCSS) Combatant Commanders/ Joint Task Force (CC/JTF) was developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to respond to the operational concept of Focused Logistics articulated in Joint Vision 2010, and reinforced in Joint Vision 2020. Focused logistics is the fusion of logistics information and transportation technologies for rapid crisis response; deployment and sustainment; the ability to track and shift units, equipment and supplies and the delivery of tailored logistical packages directly to the warfight.


Public Affairs
Portable satellite systems are also used extensively by government offices to broadcast stories of Interest to their constituencies and to provide media access to forward deployed service members. Norsat’s NewsLinkT 3200 Is widely used by the US Army Public Affairs Offices to arrange live Interviews between soldiers and members of the media based outside of the war theater.

About Norsat International, Inc







Norsat has pioneered advances in portable satellite and microwave communications technologies for over 30 years. The company offers a full range of LNB's, BUC's and SSPA's in C-, Ka- and Ku-band. It has offices in the UK and Asia and a production plant in Canada.HistoryNorsat International Inc. began operating in 1977 as Northern Satellite Systems with a mission to develop leading satellite technologies for the consumer and commercial markets. Since that time, the Company has established a solid history of developing innovative, high quality products, bringing many industry firsts to market.The founder of Northern Satellite Systems (later named Norsat) and first President was Rod Wheeler. He started the company on an innovative idea; to build the first affordable consumer satellite dish. From his cabin in Whitehorse, Yukon, Rod toiled over the construction of a workable satellite dish. Even with the limited materials he had, Rod successfully constructed a satellite dish out of chicken wire and foil. This dish was the first prototype for Norsat, and it helped launch the company into the satellite market.From these roots, Norsat extended its product offering to include a full range of microwave products, digital products for terrestrial and wireless applications, and open standard networks that provide customers with reliable, high-speed data transmission. Norsat further expanded its product portfolio to include antennas and RF conditioning products through its acquisition of Sinclair Technologies, Inc. in January 2011.Today, Norsat designs, engineers, and markets its products and services worldwide. Norsat’s established reputation, proven track record, and progressive product offering positions the company to achieve its vision of becoming a premier solutions provider of broadband communications infrastructure for remote and austere regions of the world.To date, Norsat has sold more than 2.5 million products in 87 countries throughout the world. In March 2017 China based Mobile Communications Company Hytera Communications Corp. Ltd. acquired Norsat in a 62 million USD cash deal.
