History[edit]
Founded in 1856, NBT Bank was first a state-chartered bank called the Bank of Norwich. On June 28, 1865, the bank received a national charter (which it holds to this day)[4] and changed its name to the National Bank of Norwich. In 1918, NBT Bank was one of the first national banks in New York State to apply for and receive trust powers under a Federal Reserve act and established a Trust Department. In 1925, NBT Bank changed its name a second time to better reflect its expanded services. Over the years, the area served by NBT Bank expanded and in 1989 the bank changed its name for the third time to The National Bank and Trust Company without "of Norwich." In 1995, the bank changed its name for the fourth time to NBT Bank, N.A. (The "N.A." stands for "National Association" and is used primarily in formal or legal contexts.) At the same time, NBT Bank introduced its current logo featuring a blue star and red lettering.
In 2016, NBT Bank celebrated its 160th year in business and published an updated history of the bank to commemorate this milestone.[5]
Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
NBT Bank completed its first acquisitions in the 1930s. Since that time, the bank has continued to grow through bank and branch acquisitions as well as through organic expansion.
Since 2000, NBT Bank acquired the following banks: LA Bank based in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 2000; Pioneer American Bank based in Carbondale, Pennsylvania in 2000; First National Bank of Northern New York based in Norfolk, New York in 2001; Central National Bank based in Canajoharie, New York in 2001; City National Bank and Trust Company based in Gloversville, New York in 2005; Hampshire First Bank based in Manchester, New Hampshire in 2012; and Alliance Bank based in Syracuse, New York in 2013. The merger with Alliance Bank was completed on March 8[6] and is NBT Bank's largest to date.
Naming Rights[edit]
NBT Bank owns the naming rights to NBT Bank Stadium in Syracuse, New York.

History[edit]
Founded in 1856, NBT Bank was first a state-chartered bank called the Bank of Norwich. On June 28, 1865, the bank received a national charter (which it holds to this day)[4] and changed its name to the National Bank of Norwich. In 1918, NBT Bank was one of the first national banks in New York State to apply for and receive trust powers under a Federal Reserve act and established a Trust Department. In 1925, NBT Bank changed its name a second time to better reflect its expanded services. Over the years, the area served by NBT Bank expanded and in 1989 the bank changed its name for the third time to The National Bank and Trust Company without "of Norwich." In 1995, the bank changed its name for the fourth time to NBT Bank, N.A. (The "N.A." stands for "National Association" and is used primarily in formal or legal contexts.) At the same time, NBT Bank introduced its current logo featuring a blue star and red lettering.
In 2016, NBT Bank celebrated its 160th year in business and published an updated history of the bank to commemorate this milestone.[5]
Mergers and Acquisitions[edit]
NBT Bank completed its first acquisitions in the 1930s. Since that time, the bank has continued to grow through bank and branch acquisitions as well as through organic expansion.
Since 2000, NBT Bank acquired the following banks: LA Bank based in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 2000; Pioneer American Bank based in Carbondale, Pennsylvania in 2000; First National Bank of Northern New York based in Norfolk, New York in 2001; Central National Bank based in Canajoharie, New York in 2001; City National Bank and Trust Company based in Gloversville, New York in 2005; Hampshire First Bank based in Manchester, New Hampshire in 2012; and Alliance Bank based in Syracuse, New York in 2013. The merger with Alliance Bank was completed on March 8[6] and is NBT Bank's largest to date.
Naming Rights[edit]
NBT Bank owns the naming rights to NBT Bank Stadium in Syracuse, New York.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
