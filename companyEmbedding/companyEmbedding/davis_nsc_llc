Welcome to Davis Products

Full Line of Janitorial Supplies, Paper and Disposables, Cleaning Equipment, and Fire and Safety Products.


Paper and Disposable Products 
    

In 1959 Dick Weintritt purchased Davis Products Co in Bogalusa. At the time,  it was a lawn mower repair shop that went to New Orleans weekly to pick up presold brooms and mops for local customers.  I-10 in the New Orleans area was under construction and Causeway Boulevard on the Northshore was a two lane road with dirt shoulders.
Fifty four years later Davis Products is in its second generation of leadership and has diversified geographically, as well as in its product offering.
We continue to be the only Northshore supplier to address all aspects of the facility maintenance and janitorial supply industry. Whether you need housekeeping or building maintenance items, janitorial or laundry products, food service or ware wash, cleaning equipment or fire extinguishers, or any combination of the above, you can rely on us to provide the products, procedures and training necessary to accomplish your goals.
Through strategic partnerships with our key suppliers we will design and implement effective strategies that cover a multitude of areas, keeping your facility clean, safe and healthy from the restroom to the boardroom, and beyond.
Thank you for visiting our website. For a glimpse into what we have to offer, please check out our site or e-mail us at customerservice@davisproductsco.com. For an immediate response please call us at 1-800-548-1995 (La and Miss Toll Free) or 985 732 2783.
