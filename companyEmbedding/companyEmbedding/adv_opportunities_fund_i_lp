ADV Partners closes initial pan-Asia fund at $545 mln


September 21, 2015
By Iris Dorbian






Asian private equity firm ADV Partners has raised $545 million for its debut pan-Asia fund. ADV Opportunities Fund I LP will mostly focus on China and India. The pool’s limited partners included a sovereign wealth fund, a superannuation fund, various U.S. state pension programs, fund of funds, endowments and family offices. Eaton Partners was the placement agent.
PRESS RELEASE
Rowayton, CT, Sept. 11, 2015 – Eaton Partners (“Eaton”), the largest independent, partner-owned, global fund placement agent, is pleased to have served as the exclusive placement agent for Asian private equity firm ADV Partners (“ADV”) on its inaugural pan-Asia fund, ADV Opportunities Fund I, L.P., exceeding its target to reach $545 million.
The fund is the fifth fundraising Eaton has closed this year in Asia, bringing the total amount raised for the region to more than $3 billion. ADV was co-founded in 2013 by Brad Landes, Suresh Prabhala and Jianyi Zhu who worked together at Mount Kellett Capital and previously held senior management roles with the Asia principal investment platforms of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. The firm is headquartered in Hong Kong and has 20 professionals across its four regional offices.
The newly-closed fund employs a value investment approach to private equity and looks to partner with entrepreneurs and management teams of mid-market companies across a range of industries. The fund invests in China and India as its main focus, with Southeast Asia and developed Asia/Australia as opportunistic markets. 





The fund has a globally diversified investor base including a sovereign wealth fund, a superannuation fund, multiple US state pension programs, fund of funds, endowments and family offices, and committed approximately 30% of the total raised to date.
“Following a detailed exercise in landscaping regional managers, we concluded that ADV’s unique yet proven strategy is well suited to capitalize on inefficiencies present in Asian markets,” said Chris Lerner, Partner and Eaton’s Head of Asia. “We worked hand-in-hand with the ADV team on the fundraise and are very proud of the outcome given 2014 and 2015 have been challenging fundraising years.”

But don't take our word for it
