Zapraszamy do lektury. https://www.krn.pl/…/spoldzielnia-czy-wspolnota-wybor-z-kor…Monument Group · 6月20日 · Niedawno pisaliśmy, że Kraków jest jednym z najczystszych miast w Polsce. Teraz podsyłamy link do raportu, że jest też w czołówce najbezpieczniejszych. Raport zawierał kilka czynników, które mają na to wpływ. https://www.krn.pl/…/warszawa-i-krakow-w-czolowce-najbezpie…Monument Group · 6月12日 · Choć atrakcyjność lokat bankowych zmniejsza się systematycznie już od prawie pięciu lat, nadal pozostają one najbardziej popularną formą gospodarowania oszczędnościami. W październiku 2012 r. przeciętne oprocentowanie lokat wynosiło jeszcze 4,9 proc., a odsetki od pieniędzy przechowywanych na rachunkach bieżących sięgało 2,1 proc. Dziś składając pieniądze w banku na okres do dwóch lat możemy liczyć średnio na zaledwie 1,5 proc., zaś na „kontach” na 0,5 proc. Mimo, że zdecydow...ana większość tych ostatnich nie daje żadnych odsetek, trzymamy na nich aż 415 mld zł, a więc 56 proc. naszych oszczędności, pozbawiając się „na własne życzenie” nawet tych niewielkich korzyści, które są możliwe do uzyskania. W skali jednostkowej najczęściej to przysłowiowe grosze, ale gdyby całą wspomnianą kwotę przeznaczyć na lokaty, do oszczędzających mogłoby trafić po roku ponad 5 mld zł, uwzględniając podatek. Rada Polityki Pieniężnej zapowiada, że podwyżkę oficjalnych stóp procentowych będzie rozważać prawdopodobnie dopiero w 2018 r., a więc do tego czasu banki z pewnością nie zwiększą atrakcyjności swej oferty, a i później nie będą raczej zbyt hojne. Mając przed sobą perspektywę jeszcze co najmniej kilkunastomiesięcznej odsetkowej posuchy, powiększa się coraz bardziej grono Polaków, ruszających na poszukiwanie lepszych możliwości. Słychać o tym coraz więcej zarówno w mediach, jak i prywatnych rozmowach i widać to już wyraźnie w wielu statystykach. Dostrzegalna wyraźnie jest także całkiem naturalna tendencja kierowania się w pierwszej kolejności ku alternatywom najbardziej bezpiecznym i rozwiązaniom najprostszym. 展开Monument Group · 5月31日 · Warto mieszkać w Krakowie :) II miejsce ex aequo z wynikiem 5,41 wśród miast z liczbą mieszkańców powyżej 300 tys w raporcie oceniającym czystość  "Czyste miasto to nie tylko schludne i zadbane ulice, chodniki i parki, ale też wolne od reklam czy wulgaryzmów ściany budynków, a także czyste powietrze. W takim miejscu żyje się lepiej i bardziej komfortowo, a także zdrowiej. Gdy nasza okolica jest schludna, chce nam się w niej przebywać i jest to też powód do dumy – nie wstydzim...y się tego, jak mieszkamy. Czystość i  porządek odczuwalnie wpływają nie tylko na nasz komfort życia, ale też bezpieczeństwo."

To największy wzrost odnotowany dla miast wojewódzkich – wynika z raportu firmy monitorującej rynek nieruchomości Emmerson Evaluation. W tym roku ceny mają pozostać na obecnym poziomie. 🤔Monument Group · 3月14日 · W ciągu najbliższych tygodni mieszkańcy będą się mogli zapoznać z poprawioną po konsultacjach propozycją uchwały krajobrazowej. Dokument będzie regulował m.in. kwestię reklam w przestrzeni miasta. Wiceprezydent Koterba zdradza, że zmiany nie spełnią wszystkich oczekiwań przedsiębiorców.
