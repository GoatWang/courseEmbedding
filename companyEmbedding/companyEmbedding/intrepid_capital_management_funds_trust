Investment Objective
                                        "To Invest globally in stocks which are trading at massive discount to intrinsic value"

The investment objective of Intrepid Capital Management is to achieve long term capital appreciation, by investing in global equity markets, and providing investors with a return that over multiple years exceeds that of the major global developed, emerging and frontier equity indices with a low correlation to those indices. The Company seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies in equity markets. This investment approach primarily uses bottom-up company factors but also takes country risks and other factors into account. The Company examines currency vulnerability, inflation and country growth potential. The Company evaluates each company using a proprietary valuation tool that accounts for varying business models, industries and corporate governance practices. Ultimately, the Company aims to invest in companies available at a deep discount to their intrinsic value. Typical features of such investments include, history of earnings growth, good return of capital, strong financial position, discount to asset values, and shareholder focused management, The Company finds such opportunities to be usually more prevalent in frontier and emerging markets, and in equities with little or non-existent analyst coverage.
