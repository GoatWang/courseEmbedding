Copper Rock Capital Partners LLC provides specialized equity management for pension and profit-sharing plans, institutional investors, and mutual funds. The Boston-based firm was founded in 2005.


"Copper Rock believes that the small and mid cap markets are inefficient and therefore provide significant opportunity to generate alpha for our clients. We apply rigorous fundamental research combined with quantitative analysis in conjunction with a rigid sell discipline to identify companies with superior growth relative to their peers. We believe our ability to identify these top-performing companies before widespread investor recognition drives valuations upwards, leads to consistent levels of out-performance over time."

Company Description


Copper Rock Capital Partners focuses on managing and servicing small and small- to mid-cap growth clients. The firm seeks to add value through bottom-up stock selection. Investment decisions are based on in-depth fundamental research. The investment team generates initial investment ideas from a number of sources including organic ideas, proprietary screens and bottom-up themes. This eligible universe is then streamlined to an investable universe. Investment ideas that survive this initial research stage are subject to rigorous and detailed fundamental analysis before being purchased into clients' portfolios. Copper Rock Capital Partners incorporates rigorous buy and sell disciplines in the investment process. They invest in companies with growing revenues, expanding margins and increasing market shares. In addition to these characteristics, the firm looks for companies with strong management teams. Holdings are reduced or sold as target prices are attained, if there is a change in the company's management team or stated business objectives or if there is deterioration in a company's fundamentals.
