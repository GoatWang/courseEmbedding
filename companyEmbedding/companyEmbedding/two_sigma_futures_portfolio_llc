Hedge Funds Database
In our Free Hedge Funds Database we have listed more than 4000+ hedge funds and institutional investors. You can see the fund’s summary, employees, AUM, portfolio values, historical 13F, current portfolio, holdings, new positions, sector weights, sentiment, turnover, top 10 holdings and more.
What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Two Sigma Investments, LLC
(Compass Enhanced US Fund)

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The TWO SIGMA COMPASS ENHANCED Program is a systematic, globally-focused program that targets absolute dollar-denominated returns generally using leveraged investment strategies and a rigorous risk management framework. The strategies utilized seek to apply technical and fundamental computer based-trading models researched and developed by the analyst team of the Fund's Adviser, Two Sigma Investments, LLC. These strategies attempt to monitor, identify and take advantage of opportunities across more than 90 markets worldwide, focused on futures (such as stock indices, fixed-income, and commodities) and currencies. The strategies employed are primarily short- to medium-frequency in nature, resulting in turnover consistent with an average holding period of less than two weeks. These strategies seek to manage portfolio risk utilizing position limits and an optimizer, in conjunction with human oversight. The volatility for the Fund is expected to be approximately 30%.
Performance through July 2009 reflects actual combined performance of strategies traded by Two Sigma Futures Portfolio, LLC and Two Sigma Futures Portfolio II, LLC. Performance from August 2009 onwards is taken from Two Sigma Compass Enhanced US Fund LP. Assets reported are strategy assets.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE: Return statistics shown on the previous page of this document from August 1, 2009, the standalone entity's first trade date, to the date of this report reflect actual returns of Two Sigma Compass Enhanced U.S. Fund, LP, net of a 4% management fee, 20% incentive allocation (if any) AND EXPENSES. Return statistics shown on the previous page of this document from January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2009 reflect the combined performance of strategies traded by Two Sigma Futures Portfolio, LLC ("FTV") and Two Sigma Futures Portfolio II, LLC ("FTV II" and, collectively with FTV, the "Futures and FX Entities") for the period January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2009 (excluding certain non-model based trades including, without limit, those effected as hedges for Two Sigma's equity portfolios), net of a hypothetical 4% management fee and 20% incentive allocation (if any), and modified on a pro forma basis to reflect approximately twice their realized volatility. The results shown are gross of expenses (other than commission expenses) that were applied to the futures and FX entities. Two Sigma Compass Enhanced U.S. Fund, LP, via Two Sigma Compass Master Fund, Ltd., invests its assets in the Futures and FX Entities, with the exception of the substantial portion of capital invested in Two Sigma's cash management entities. Although subject to change at any time in Two Sigma's sole discretion and without notice to any investor, Two Sigma Compass Enhanced U.S. Fund, LP is anticipated to exhibit allocations to the Futures and FX Entities similar in proportion to those exhibited historically by other of Two Sigma's funds prior to August 1, 2009 and therefore reflected in the return statistics shown in the shaded area above. Additionally, although subject to change at any time, the volatility of Two Sigma Compass Enhanced U.S. Fund, LP from August 1, 2009 onwards is expected to be approximately 30%, which is higher than the volatility for the pro forma performance results in the shaded area above.  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT AN INDICATOR OR GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

This document is being furnished to the recipient on a confidential basis, is not intended for public use or distribution, and by accepting this document, you agree to keep confidential the existence of this document and the information contained herein. The recipient should not disclose, reproduce, distribute or otherwise make available the existence of and/or all or any portion of the information contained herein to any other person (other than its employees, officers and advisors on a need-to-know basis, whom the recipient will cause to keep the information confidential) without Two Sigma's prior written consent.

THE PERFORMANCE FIGURES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE UNAUDITED AND HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY TWO SIGMA (AS DEFINED BELOW) BASED ON UNAUDITED FIGURES COMPILED FROM HISTORICAL DATA.  ACCORDINGLY, WHILE THIS DATA WAS OBTAINED FROM SOURCES BELIEVED TO BE RELIABLE AND COMPILED IN A MANNER THAT IS BELIEVED TO BE CORRECT, TSI PROVIDES NO ASSURANCE AS TO ITS ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS.

Disclosure Regarding the Futures and FX Entities

Two Sigma Investments, LLC, its employees and members (collectively, "Two Sigma") have engineered certain software that attempts to reflect the performance that would have resulted had Two Sigma managed a portfolio consisting solely of investments in the Futures and FX Entities with a certain fee structure over the period of January 1, 2005 through July 31, 2009. Two Sigma has elected to present performance data beginning January 1, 2005 because that is the date on which Two Sigma began trading in futures and currencies in FTV II.  FTV, on the other hand, was launched prior to this date and therefore the performance data contained herein does not represent a complete history of the activity of such entity. The results presented herein are unaudited and have been computed by Two Sigma based on unaudited figures compiled from historical data. These results should not be relied upon.

Although the performance data from January 1, 2005 to July 31, 2009 presented herein are based on actual trading results achieved by Two Sigma, they do not represent the return of any client of Two Sigma or any other person.  Rather, they represent the performance that would have resulted had Two Sigma managed a portfolio consisting solely of an investment in the Futures and FX Entities (excluding certain non-model based trades including, without limit, those effected as hedges for Two Sigma's equity portfolios),while targeting twice the realized volatility, that included a four percent (4%) fixed fee on assets under management and a twenty percent (20%) annual incentive allocation (taken in arrears, if any). The results shown are gross of expenses (other than commission expenses) that were applied to the Futures and FX Entities. The performance achieved by investors in the Fund may be materially lower than the results shown based on such expenses. Although subject to change at any time in Two Sigma's sole discretion and without notice to any investor, the Compass Funds are anticipated to exhibit allocations to the Futures and FX Entities similar in proportion to those exhibited historically by other of Two Sigma's funds prior to August 1, 2009. 

 
The actual performance of any trading program Two Sigma ultimately elects to employ from time to time on behalf of the Compass Funds is dependent on, and influenced by, any number of factors, many of which (i) have not been taken into account in presenting this performance data; (ii) are inherently difficult to quantify; and (iii) are outside Two Sigma's control. Further, future performance may be affected by existing and/or new events or factors, which may or may not have played any material role in the past. Therefore, no assurance or guarantee can be given that the trading results achieved employing strategies and/or models employed during the period presented herein, and/or others that may be used in the future, will be as successful and/or achieve the same results as those presented above. AS ALWAYS, PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO INDICATOR OR GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

Further, Two Sigma's investment strategies and trading models are likely to evolve over time and there can be no assurance that the trading program pursued by Two Sigma on behalf of the Compass Funds or any other funds in actual trading will be the same or substantially the same as the ones that were utilized during the period presented above.  In addition, Two Sigma makes no representation that the relative weighting assigned to each of FTV and/or FTV II in order to calculate the performance data presented above bears any correlation to its current intention with regard to the Compass Funds' planned investments in the Futures and FX Entities.  And finally, Two Sigma may, in its sole discretion, deploy new trading models in either or both of the Futures and FX Entities and those trading models (which are not reflected in these results) may have a material impact on the results achieved by either or both of the Futures and FX Entities and in turn the Compass Funds.
