*HOLLOW METAL DOORS & FRAMES  *SOLID CORE WOOD DOORS  *HARDWARE *SPECIALTY PRODUCTS  *VALUE ENGINEERING  *SPEC WRITING

What's in a name?  We at JMP Products, LLC think names are important! Our names tell who we are and what we stand for.  We named our company JMP Products after John McKinley Payton.  John Payton was our grandfather who was also a master carpenter. He worked hard through the years to build a reputation in his work in the mountains of Chattanooga, TN during the early to mid 1900's.  He set the example for those coming after him of hard work, honesty, integrity, and perfection in his work as well as a strong love for God and for his family. We at JMP Products, LLC desire to honor his legacy by continuing the family tradition.  We are here for any of your hollow metal doors & frames, wood doors, hardware, specialty products, value engineering and spec writing needs.  Give us a chance to prove that there is one thing that cannot be found on specification sheets, drawings, or our competitors' shelves.  We at JMP Products, LLC pride ourselves on not just providing our customers great products, competitive prices, and an unparalleled knowledge of the industry but also OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE. Contact us today and give us the chance to become your favorite door, hardware and specialty supplier!

"I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture."  John 10:9

SERVICES
 The Importance of Liquidation
In today’s economy, efficient inventory management is more important than ever. With banks and lenders continuing to squeeze credit limits, liquidation is now considered a smart business strategy rather than a company’s last resort. Small businesses need the services of JMP Enterprises, LLC to minimize exposure and maximize inventory turns.

  

Manufacturer Rep Samples
Why let your resources stay tied up in product samples? Most Manufacturer’s Reps are required to pay for their product samples, which decreases overall profit margins each season. Then there is the space needed to store these samples.
Many reps resort to selling their product samples to their own account base which has the net effect of reducing wholesale sales volume and subsequent commissions. Others let them sit for years and accumulate dust. Why not let JMP Enterprises purchase your samples, clean out your garages and warehouses and put money back into your pocket?!
If you’re busy and don’t have the time to inventory everything, just let us know and we’ll send you a deposit, receive and inventory your merchandise, and then send you a check with the accounting!
Overstocks, Closeouts and Obsolete Inventory
Minimize exposure by selling off bulk inventory before it’s too late. Sitting on merchandise that isn’t selling is dangerous for any company, especially the Small Business owner. In addition to the depreciation of your inventory, there are other costs to holding dead stock inventory: the cost of space (warehouse or retail), the cost of managing the inventory, the interest payable on your inventory, and finally, your credit limit.
JMP Enterprises can help you with overstocks, closeouts, or obsolete inventory.
