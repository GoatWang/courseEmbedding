* Fund Inception Date 06/16/2006






Performance is historical and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance data for the most recent month-end is available above.
 
WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

WisdomTree shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00pm net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Market price returns do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.
 
After-Tax Held Returns represent return on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and assumes Fund shares have not been sold. After-Tax Sold Returns represent returns on Fund shares after taxes on distributions and the sale of the Fund shares.
 
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's individual tax rates and may differ from those shown.
 
In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

WHAT IS SMART BETA?
 
Some define smart beta as simply any type of index that is not market capitalization weighted. In our opinion, there are many types of smart beta approaches, and the ones we believe are attracting the most attention currently are:
 
Equally Weighted Indexes
Components are often selected from established indexes such as the S&P 500 but are equally weighted so that all components have identical weights when rebalanced.

Fundamentally Weighted Indexes
Components are selected to provide broad exposure to an equity market based on market capitalization, but companies are weighted by a fundamental factor such as aggregate dividends or earnings.

Factor-Based Indexes
Components are selected based on one or more fundamental factors and are weighted based on one or more fundamental factors. Factor-based indexes can also be modified equal weighted, where stocks are first divided into tiers based on certain factors and then equal weighted within those tiers.

Low Volatility Indexes
Components are selected because they have exhibited lower volatility than the overall stock market and/or are weighted based on their historic volatility.

OUR SMART BETA APPROACH
 
It can be challenging to differentiate between smart investment approaches and smart marketing. When it comes to identifying smart beta, we think investors should look for:
 
 
1



A rules-based, repeatable methodology that offers broad, representative exposure to an asset class



 
2



        Alternative weighting methods that allow for ample investment capacity
    

 
3



        High Correlations to established benchmarks
    



 
4



        An established track record on a total-return and risk-adjusted basis

THE HISTORY OF SMART BETA
 
Though you may just now be hearing about smart beta ETFs, they have been around for some time. In fact, WisdomTree was an early pioneer in this category, inventing the concept of dividend weighting equity markets.
 
2006



In 2006, we launched one of the first families of alternatively weighted ETFs, calling them “fundamentally weighted.”We weighted these first ETFs by dividends because we believe there is a benefit to rebalancing equity markets back to a measure of relative value.


 
2007



        From there, in 2007, we applied the same methodology to the earnings-generating segments of the market to expand our offering.
    

 
2014



        Today, WisdomTree offers investors smart beta ETFs in all major equity markets around the world.
    

Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.


THE BENEFITS OF SMART BETA

Investment managers and investors alike are always looking for better ways to invest. Indexing can be highly efficient, and ETFs have a number of benefits that make them a wise way to invest and have led to their quick adoption and impressive industry growth.
 


Enhanced portfolio returns


Increased dividend income



Reduced portfolio risk



More efficient exposure to equity risk premium1





1Equity Risk Premium refers to the excess return that an individual stock or the overall stock market provides over a risk-free rate. This excess return compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of the equity market. The size of the premium will vary as the risk in a particular stock, or in the stock market as a whole, changes; high-risk investments are compensated with a higher premium.

Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.

Dividends are not guaranteed and a company’s future ability to pay dividends may be limited. A company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time.


THE FUTURE OF SMART BETA ETFs
 
While some industry insiders may worry that smart beta is a fad, investors do not seem to agree. Consider that:
 
1



U.S.-listed ETFs tracking non-market cap-weighted indexes gathered $65 billion, or nearly one-third of new net inflows, in 2013.1



 
2



A new study conducted by Cogent Research, a division of Market Strategies International, indicates that more than half (53%) of institutional decision makers will increase their use of smart beta ETFs over the next three years—that’s more than any other ETF category, including market cap-weighted ETFs (48%).2



 
3



According to Morningstar, ETFs have grown at double the rate of mutual funds since January 2009, with asset growth of 100% and 50%, respectively.3



We believe these findings could lead to smart beta being the largest category of ETFs and the primary driver of ETF growth going forward, perhaps helping them match equity mutual fund assets under management (currently $8.4 trillion)4 in less than a decade.

How We Weight By Dividends


How We Weight By Dividends

While the majority of ETFs are market cap-weighted — meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals - WisdomTree has developed a proprietary index methodology designed to magnify the effect fundamentals have on risk and return characteristics.

The WisdomTree Dividend Indexes typically weight each stock eligible for inclusion by its share of the Dividend Stream®, defined as the sum of regular cash dividends paid by all the companies in the respective Index.
