CRANBURY, N.J., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Innophos Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:    IPHS), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017.








Q1 2017 Highlights 

Q1 performance at the high end of the preliminary financial results range provided April 5th 
Continued cost savings from Phase 1 Operational Excellence initiatives; identified $13 million of Phase 2 Operational Excellence cost savings 
Improved margin profile due to better product mix and disciplined cost controls  
Implemented a market-centric realignment of Commercial Organization 
Unveiled Vision 2022 at April 5th Investor Day; Strategic Growth Roadmap targeting revenue growth to $1.25 billion and a 250 basis point improvement in Adjusted EBITDA by 2022 
Launched new external reporting segments aligned with market-facing approach and strategic direction 
Appointed seasoned global operations executive Mark Santangelo as Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, Engineering and EH&S

"We were pleased with our first quarter performance compared to the preliminary financial results range we provided at our Investor Day," said Kim Ann Mink, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This included sales in line with expectations, adjusted EBITDA at the high end of the range, and net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share higher than initially estimated due to a recent change in tax treatment for stock compensation. By remaining focused on cost savings from performance improvement initiatives and leveraging improved product mix, we drove margin growth sequentially and year-over-year despite market headwinds.
"As recently announced, we have further strengthened the foundation of the management team with the appointment of Mark Santangelo as Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, Engineering and EH&S," continued Dr. Mink. "Mark brings required new skill sets, innovative ideas, external best practices, and extensive experience to the team, including a proven track record of leading global manufacturing organizations and effectively participating in all stages of M&A. As we continue to execute on our strategic pillars, Mark's contributions will be valuable in supporting our transformation and focus on creating strategic growth and delivering value for our shareholders.
"Looking ahead, although we expect market headwinds to persist, we remain confident that by focusing on the factors that we can control we will continue to position Innophos for revitalized growth," Dr. Mink continued. "Our priorities in 2017 remain to advance the second Phase of our Operational Excellence initiatives, implement our newly introduced market-focused global sales organization under Commercial Excellence, and execute our newly defined and actionable Strategic Growth Roadmap.
"Our Strategic Growth Roadmap sets us on a course for delivering meaningful expansion through targeted organic and disciplined inorganic growth with a clear goal of becoming a larger, more profitable Innophos with a market leading position as a specialty ingredient solutions provider to the Food, Health, and Nutrition (FHN) markets. We are strengthening our core Specialty Phosphates business serving FHN and Industrial Specialties (IS) markets to more effectively compete and continue delivering strong cash generation, while seeking growth opportunities through acquisitions in attractive, high-growth segments of the FHN markets.  By executing against our plan, we are confident that we can deliver on our recently announced Vision 2022, where we are targeting $1.25 billion of revenue with a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin profile by 2022," Dr. Mink concluded.

Net sales for the first quarter 2017 of $166 million were down 12% compared with the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to a 7% decline in volumes of lower margin, less differentiated applications and 5% lower average selling prices.
Net Income of $11 million for the first quarter 2017 was down $2 million from the first quarter of 2016 impacted by $1 million of Phase 2 Operational Excellence implementation fees and $1 million of severance costs. Net income as a percent of sales was 7%, down 19 basis points from the prior year quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $28 million for the first quarter 2017 yielded a margin of 17%, up 21 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. 
Diluted EPS for the first quarter 2017 was $0.55 compared with $0.66 for the first quarter 2016. The current quarter includes $0.02 of fees to begin the implementation of Phase 2 Operational Excellence initiatives. We anticipate these fees to be more than offset by savings over the course of 2017, which will start to occur during the second half of the year.  
Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter 2017 was $0.59, versus $0.66 for the first quarter 2016. The current quarter includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a change in taxation on stock compensation effective January 1, 2017.  
Net Cash from operations showed an outflow of $11 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with an outflow of $3 million for the first quarter of 2016.

A seasonal net working capital build of $30 million in the current quarter accounts for most of the year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow. 
Net working capital declined 18%, or $35 million, year-over-year. 
Average working capital declined 15%, or $27 million, year-over-year.

Free cash flow was a $19 million outflow in the first quarter 2017, compared with an $11 million outflow in the same period of 2016, as a result of seasonal working capital build and higher capital expenditures due to the previously announced deep well investment at our Geismar facility.
Net debt decreased 26%, or $55 million, year-over-year, but increased sequentially by 21%, or $28 million, due to seasonal working capital increases. 
New Reporting Segments 
As announced at the Company's April 5th Investor Day, effective Q1 2017, Innophos transitioned to three new reporting segments: Food, Health and Nutrition (FHN), Industrial Specialties (IS) and Other. 
"The new reporting segments more accurately reflect the underlying business dynamics and align with the strategic direction of the Company," said Han Kieftenbeld, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

FHN sales of $91 million were down 7% versus the prior-year quarter, with 4% lower volumes and 3% lower average selling prices. The volume decline was primarily seen in high margin export sales driven by external factors, including currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela and increased import tariffs into China. Sales in India saw a slowdown due to generally lower than anticipated growth. 
IS sales of $64 million were down 15% versus the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the year-over-year effect from pruning actions, which led to an 8% decline in volumes of lower margin, less differentiated applications and 7% lower average selling prices. 
Other sales of $11 million were down 33% versus the prior-year quarter due to 22% lower volumes and 11% lower selling prices, mostly due to order pattern and the impact from low commodity market prices.

FHN margins declined 255 basis points due to the aforementioned sales volume decline in high margin applications. 
IS margins improved 295 basis points due to improved mix from product pruning and cost controls. 
Other margins improved 144 basis points on improved product mix.   

Recent Trends and Outlook  
Q2 2017 Sales comparables in Q2 are expected to improve sequentially, but still be down approximately 5% year-over-year, due primarily to portfolio pruning of lower margin, less differentiated applications, which did not take full effect until the second half of 2016. External factors impacting sales into Venezuela and China are expected to continue into the second quarter.
Earnings in the second quarter are forecast to be impacted by the remainder of consulting fees for the implementation of Phase 2 of Operational Excellence initiatives, which are estimated to be approximately $3 million.
Input costs and operating costs in Q2, with the notable exception of the aforementioned fees, are expected to be in line with Q1.
The favorable Q1 tax rate of 28% was significantly helped by the change in taxation on stock compensation. Excluding this discrete item, the effective tax rate for the current quarter would have been 33%. The Company anticipates that the tax rate will return to the more normalized level of approximately 33% beginning in the second quarter.
Full YearOn a full year basis, overall market conditions and the competitive landscape for 2017 are expected to be similar to 2016. Volume headwinds are expected to remain through the balance of the year due to the strong US dollar and pricing headwinds. Pruning effects are expected to improve in the second half of the year.
The Company anticipates that the Phase 2 Operational Excellence fees incurred in the first half of the year will be more than offset by the Phase 2 savings, of which $5 million is estimated to take effect in the second half of 2017.
As a result of these factors, the Company continues to expect full year revenues to be down by 4% compared with 2016. Full year earnings are expected to be broadly in line with 2016, reflecting the impact of management's focus on cost actions and productivity initiatives given the challenging market conditions.

Price / Volume 
The Company calculates pure selling price dollar variances as the selling price for the current year to date period minus the selling price for the prior year to date period, and then multiplies the resulting selling price difference by the prior year to date period volume. The current quarter selling price dollar variance is derived from the current quarter year to date selling price dollar variance less the previous quarter year to date selling price dollar variance. The selling price dollar variance is then divided by the prior period sales dollars to calculate the percentage change. Volume variance is calculated as the total sales variance minus the selling price variance and refers to the revenue effect of changes in tons sold at the relative prices applicable to the variation in tons, otherwise known as volume/mix. 
The following table illustrates the percentage changes in net sales by reportable segments compared with the same period of the prior year, including the effect of selling price and volume/mix changes upon revenue:

Additional InformationNet debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net debt as total long-term debt (including any current portion) less cash and cash equivalents.
Free cash flow is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes free cash flow is helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures.
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as performance measures for purposes of presentation in this release.
Net Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net working capital as total current assets less cash less total current liabilities.  
Innophos is not able to provide a reconciliation of its 2022 expectation for Adjusted EBITDA margin to GAAP net income due to the number of variables in the projected EBITDA margin for 2022 and because we are currently unable to quantify accurately certain amounts that would be required to be included in GAAP net income or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Innophos Holdings, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Results
Improved Margin Profile Driven by Cost Controls and Favorable Product MixContinued Progress Advancing Three Strategic Pillars of Operational Excellence, Commercial Excellence and Strategic Growth in Support of Vision 2022


CRANBURY, N.J., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Innophos Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:  IPHS), today announced its financial results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017.
Q1 2017 Highlights 

Q1 performance at the high end of the preliminary financial results range provided April 5th
Continued cost savings from Phase 1 Operational Excellence initiatives; identified $13 million of Phase 2 Operational Excellence cost savings

Improved margin profile due to better product mix and disciplined cost controls 

Implemented a market-centric realignment of Commercial Organization
Unveiled Vision 2022 at April 5th Investor Day; Strategic Growth Roadmap targeting revenue growth to $1.25 billion and a 250 basis point improvement in Adjusted EBITDA by 2022

Launched new external reporting segments aligned with market-facing approach and strategic direction

Appointed seasoned global operations executive Mark Santangelo as Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, Engineering and EH&S
"We were pleased with our first quarter performance compared to the preliminary financial results range we provided at our Investor Day," said Kim Ann Mink, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This included sales in line with expectations, adjusted EBITDA at the high end of the range, and net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share higher than initially estimated due to a recent change in tax treatment for stock compensation. By remaining focused on cost savings from performance improvement initiatives and leveraging improved product mix, we drove margin growth sequentially and year-over-year despite market headwinds.
"As recently announced, we have further strengthened the foundation of the management team with the appointment of Mark Santangelo as Senior Vice President of Manufacturing, Engineering and EH&S," continued Dr. Mink. "Mark brings required new skill sets, innovative ideas, external best practices, and extensive experience to the team, including a proven track record of leading global manufacturing organizations and effectively participating in all stages of M&A. As we continue to execute on our strategic pillars, Mark's contributions will be valuable in supporting our transformation and focus on creating strategic growth and delivering value for our shareholders.
"Looking ahead, although we expect market headwinds to persist, we remain confident that by focusing on the factors that we can control we will continue to position Innophos for revitalized growth," Dr. Mink continued. "Our priorities in 2017 remain to advance the second Phase of our Operational Excellence initiatives, implement our newly introduced market-focused global sales organization under Commercial Excellence, and execute our newly defined and actionable Strategic Growth Roadmap.
"Our Strategic Growth Roadmap sets us on a course for delivering meaningful expansion through targeted organic and disciplined inorganic growth with a clear goal of becoming a larger, more profitable Innophos with a market leading position as a specialty ingredient solutions provider to the Food, Health, and Nutrition (FHN) markets. We are strengthening our core Specialty Phosphates business serving FHN and Industrial Specialties (IS) markets to more effectively compete and continue delivering strong cash generation, while seeking growth opportunities through acquisitions in attractive, high-growth segments of the FHN markets.  By executing against our plan, we are confident that we can deliver on our recently announced Vision 2022, where we are targeting $1.25 billion of revenue with a 20% adjusted EBITDA 
margin profile by 2022," Dr. Mink concluded.

Net sales for the first quarter 2017 of $166 million were down 12% compared with the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to a 7% decline in volumes of lower margin, less differentiated applications and 5% lower average selling prices.
Net Income of $11 million for the first quarter 2017 was down $2 million from the first quarter of 2016 impacted by $1 million of Phase 2 Operational Excellence implementation fees and $1 million of severance costs. Net income as a percent of sales was 7%, down 19 basis points from the prior year quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $28 million for the first quarter 2017 yielded a margin of 17%, up 21 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. 
Diluted EPS for the first quarter 2017 was $0.55 compared with $0.66 for the first quarter 2016. The current quarter includes $0.02 of fees to begin the implementation of Phase 2 Operational Excellence initiatives. We anticipate these fees to be more than offset by savings over the course of 2017, which will start to occur during the second half of the year.  
Adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter 2017 was $0.59, versus $0.66 for the first quarter 2016. The current quarter includes a $0.04 per share benefit from a change in taxation on stock compensation effective January 1, 2017.  
Net Cash from operations showed an outflow of $11 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with an outflow of $3 million for the first quarter of 2016.

A seasonal net working capital build of $30 million in the current quarter accounts for most of the year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow.

Net working capital declined 18%, or $35 million, year-over-year.

Average working capital declined 15%, or $27 million, year-over-year.
Free cash flow was a $19 million outflow in the first quarter 2017, compared with an $11 million outflow in the same period of 2016, as a result of seasonal working capital build and higher capital expenditures due to the previously announced deep well investment at our Geismar facility.
Net debt decreased 26%, or $55 million, year-over-year, but increased sequentially by 21%, or $28 million, due to seasonal working capital increases. 
New Reporting Segments 
As announced at the Company's April 5th Investor Day, effective Q1 2017, Innophos transitioned to three new reporting segments: Food, Health and Nutrition (FHN), Industrial Specialties (IS) and Other. 
"The new reporting segments more accurately reflect the underlying business dynamics and align with the strategic direction of the Company," said Han Kieftenbeld, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

FHN sales of $91 million were down 7% versus the prior-year quarter, with 4% lower volumes and 3% lower average selling prices. The volume decline was primarily seen in high margin export sales driven by external factors, including currency exchange restrictions in Venezuela and increased import tariffs into China. Sales in India saw a slowdown due to generally lower than anticipated growth.

IS sales of $64 million were down 15% versus the prior-year quarter, primarily due to the year-over-year effect from pruning actions, which led to an 8% decline in volumes of lower margin, less differentiated applications and 7% lower average selling prices.

Other sales of $11 million were down 33% versus the prior-year quarter due to 22% lower volumes and 11% lower selling prices, mostly due to order pattern and the impact from low commodity market prices.

FHN margins declined 255 basis points due to the aforementioned sales volume decline in high margin applications.

IS margins improved 295 basis points due to improved mix from product pruning and cost controls.

Other margins improved 144 basis points on improved product mix.   
Recent Trends and Outlook  
Q2 2017 Sales comparables in Q2 are expected to improve sequentially, but still be down approximately 5% year-over-year, due primarily to portfolio pruning of lower margin, less differentiated applications, which did not take full effect until the second half of 2016. External factors impacting sales into Venezuela and China are expected to continue into the second quarter.
Earnings in the second quarter are forecast to be impacted by the remainder of consulting fees for the implementation of Phase 2 of Operational Excellence initiatives, which are estimated to be approximately $3 million.
Input costs and operating costs in Q2, with the notable exception of the aforementioned fees, are expected to be in line with Q1.
The favorable Q1 tax rate of 28% was significantly helped by the change in taxation on stock compensation. Excluding this discrete item, the effective tax rate for the current quarter would have been 33%. The Company anticipates that the tax rate will return to the more normalized level of approximately 33% beginning in the second quarter.
Full YearOn a full year basis, overall market conditions and the competitive landscape for 2017 are expected to be similar to 2016. Volume headwinds are expected to remain through the balance of the year due to the strong US dollar and pricing headwinds. Pruning effects are expected to improve in the second half of the year.

The Company anticipates that the Phase 2 Operational Excellence fees incurred in the first half of the year will be more than offset by the Phase 2 savings, of which $5 million is estimated to take effect in the second half of 2017.
As a result of these factors, the Company continues to expect full year revenues to be down by 4% compared with 2016. Full year earnings are expected to be broadly in line with 2016, reflecting the impact of management's focus on cost actions and productivity initiatives given the challenging market conditions.

Price / Volume 
The Company calculates pure selling price dollar variances as the selling price for the current year to date period minus the selling price for the prior year to date period, and then multiplies the resulting selling price difference by the prior year to date period volume. The current quarter selling price dollar variance is derived from the current quarter year to date selling price dollar variance less the previous quarter year to date selling price dollar variance. The selling price dollar variance is then divided by the prior period sales dollars to calculate the percentage change. Volume variance is calculated as the total sales variance minus the selling price variance and refers to the revenue effect of changes in tons sold at the relative prices applicable to the variation in tons, otherwise known as volume/mix. 
The following table illustrates the percentage changes in net sales by reportable segments compared with the same period of the prior year, including the effect of selling price and volume/mix changes upon revenue:

Additional InformationNet debt is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net debt is helpful in analyzing leverage and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net debt as total long-term debt (including any current portion) less cash and cash equivalents.
Free cash flow is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes free cash flow is helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided from operating activities plus cash used for capital expenditures.
EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are supplemental financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful in analyzing the cash flow generating capability of the business and as performance measures for purposes of presentation in this release.
Net Working Capital is a supplemental financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, US GAAP. The Company believes net working capital is helpful in analyzing the effects on the cash flow generating capability of the business and as a performance measure for purposes of presentation in this release. The Company defines net working capital as total current assets less cash less total current liabilities.  
Innophos is not able to provide a reconciliation of its 2022 expectation for Adjusted EBITDA margin to GAAP net income due to the number of variables in the projected EBITDA margin for 2022 and because we are currently unable to quantify accurately certain amounts that would be required to be included in GAAP net income or the individual adjustments for such reconciliation. In addition, we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.

Dividend Capture, ex-dividend dates











 






 


























Dividend Capture
      Strategies





Want to capture 
				dividends?  Dividend Detective has the tools you need.  

Click 
				
here to subscribe.  











Did you know that you only have to 
		hold a stock for one day to collect a dividend? That fact has inspired 
		many investors to pursue dividend capture strategies that involve 
		holding a stock just long enough to collect the dividend, selling at or 
		above their purchase price, and then moving on. 
 

Of course, its not that easy. For 
		starters, theoretically, the share price drops by the dividend amount on 
		the ex-dividend date. But, in fact, many different factors influence a 
		stocks price movements on any given day, and prices typically dont 
		drop by the exact dividend amount on the ex-date.  

Dividend Capture Definitions 


Here 
		are definitions that you need to know. 

Declaration date: the day that a firm announces its next dividend. 
      Such announcements are almost always made via a press release.  

Owner of Record date: the date that you must be registered as a shareholder 
      to collect the next dividend. You become the owner of record on the third 
		business day after you purchased the shares.  

Ex-dividend date: the first day that new buyers are not 
		entitled to collect the next dividend. The ex-dividend date is 

        two business days before the "owner of record" date 
        (business days are days when New York City banks are open, not 
      stock market days). In the case of very large dividends (at least 25% 
      of the share price), to collect the dividend, you cannot sell until at 
		least one market day after the 
      payment date.  

Payment date: the day that the dividend should be deposited into 
      your brokerage account.  

Thus, in most instances, you could purchase shares on the 
		day prior to the ex-dividend date, sell on the ex-dividend date, and still collect the dividend on the payment date.  

Traditional Dividend Capture Strategies

Traditional dividend capture strategies involve buying a stock before the ex-dividend date, 
		thus qualifying to collect the dividend, and then selling some time 
		later.  

Within that general framework, traditional dividend capture players 
		employ a variety of sub-strategies. Some try to buy before the dividend is announced, some 
			sell on the ex-date, while others wait for a stock to recover to a 
			predetermined price before selling. Dividend capture is a 
			controversial topic and not everybody believes that any capture 
			strategy will be consistently profitable.  

Dividend Capture Income Tax Implications

U.S. tax rules say that you must hold a stock a least 61 days to be 
      eligible for the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate. Consequently, some 
		dividend capture investors try to hold for that period before selling. 
		Alas, such strategies are generally unproductive. For starters, doing so would limit you to six 
      trades per year. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that your trade 
		would remain profitable after waiting that long.  

You can mitigate 
		these issues by limiting your dividend capture trades to tax-sheltered 
		accounts such as IRAs or Roth IRAs. If held in an ordinary IRA, 

dividends aren't taxed until you begin taking 
		distributions from that IRA. If held in a ROTH IRA, dividends are not 
		taxed at all.  

DD's Traditional Dividend Capture 
		Strategy Resources



Dividend Detective's Ex-Dividend Calendar, a 
		Premium feature, lists all stocks 
      going ex-dividend within the next four weeks. It includes the data that 
		you'd need to implement traditional capture strategies.  If you're already 
		a DD Premium member, here's a
		link to our Ex-Dividend Calendar. If 
		not click here to join. 

DD's Advanced Dividend Capture 
Strategy


We have devised an Advanced Dividend Capture Strategy that we've found 
		produces better returns than the traditional strategies that we've tested. 

Advanced Dividend Capture Resources
Our Advanced 
		Dividend Capture Resources section includes everything you need to 
		implement our Advanced Capture Strategy including instructions on how to 
		implement the strategy and a special table that includes all needed 
		data. If you're already a DD Premium member, here's a
		link to that page.  If 
		not click here to join.
Special Dividend Resources
Special dividends are one-time payouts that that are often 
		much larger than regular dividends. For instance, regular quarterly 
		dividends typically amount to around 1% of a stocks trading price 
		compared to 3% or 4%, and sometimes much higher, for special 
		dividends. Those higher yields can translate to better profit 
		opportunities than regular dividends. D.D. Premium's Special Dividend 
		report lists all upcoming special dividends that we've evaluated as 
		investable, plus our recommended Special Dividend Trading Strategy. If you're already a Premium member, here's a link 
      to that report.  If not click here

Preferred Stocks 
Primer  
 

While money market funds are paying 
		next to nothing, 
		many preferred stocks
		are paying 5% to 8%.  



Preferred Stocks Basics 

Corporations issue preferred stocks to raise cash. 
		Although you buy or sell them the same way you trade regular stocks, 
		preferreds are more like bonds than common stocks. Investors buy them 
		for the steady dividends, which typically equate to 4% to 8% yields. 
		Most preferreds pay dividends quarterly.  

Unlike common stocks, youre wont enjoy much share price 
		appreciation if your company comes up with a hot product. Further, in 
		most cases, the dividend never goes up either.

        The term preferred means that a firm must pay the dividends due on its 
        preferred shares before it pays any common stock dividends. 
        Also, in theory, if a company goes bankrupt, preferred holders have 
        priority over common stock shareholders. However, when a company fails, 
        both common and preferred shareholders usually get nothing. 

        Finally, another meaningless distinction: unlike common stock holders, 
        preferred shareholders dont get to vote on company proposals. But, in 
        fact, individual common shareholders have almost no influence on any 
        corporation's policies. 

Preferred Stocks: What You Need to Know

        When a company issues a preferred stock, it sets the annual dividend and 
        sells the shares at a preset price, typically $25, but some are also  issued 
        at $10, $50 or $100. 

        The initial yield, called the coupon rate, is the annual dividend 
        divided by the issue price. For instance, the yield on shares paying 
        $1/year on shares issued at $25 is 4%. 

        However, since preferreds trade on the open market just like 
        regular stocks, the actual trading price depends on supply and demand. 
        Thus, if the shares mentioned above slip to $24, the yield to new 
        investors (market yield) rises to 4.2% ($1 divided by $24).  

Preferred Stock Ticker Symbols

        Companies that issue preferred stocks typically sell more than one 
        series, for instance, Series A, Series B, etc. Ticker symbols are not 
		standardized and vary from site to site. However they typically start 
		with the issuer's common stock symbol and end with the series 
		designator. For instance, the ticker for Bank of America (BAC) Series N 
		preferreds might be BAC-N, BAC-PN, BACPRN, etc. To find the ticker on a 
		particular site, use the symbol lookup function and enter the common 
		stock ticker. Most sites respond with a list of all tickers starting 
		with those letters. From that list, find the ticker ending with the 
		desired series designator. After you've done it once, you'll probably be 
		able to find additional preferreds on the same site without needing the 
		lookup function.

Calling Preferreds

        Preferreds have minimum 30-year maturities and some are perpetual, 
        meaning that the firm is not obligated to redeem them. However, most 
        preferred stocks are callable, meaning that the issuer has the right 
        to call (redeem) them at the call price after a specified date (call 
        date), typically five-years after issue. The call price is usually as the 
        original issue price, but in some instances is slightly 
        higher. 

        The issuer is not obligated to redeem the shares at the call 
        date. Issuers are likely to call their preferreds if interest rates have 
        dropped and they can save money by calling existing preferreds and 
        selling a new batch paying lower rates. Thus, depending on prevailing 
        interest rates, preferreds might continue to trade for years after the 
        call date.

Preferred Stock Returns

Preferred Stock Dividend Yield

        A preferred stock's coupon rate defines its annual dividend, but not the yield 
        that you would receive if you bought the preferreds after the issue 
        date. For instance, A 7.0% bond issued at $25 pays $1.75/share annually 
        (7% of $25). If the price drops and you only pay $23.00 per share, your 
        nominal yield would be 7.6% ($1.75 divided by $23). On the other hand,  
        your yield would drop to 6.7% if you pay $26 for the shares, which still 
        might be acceptable, depending on what banks are paying at the time. 

Preferred Stock Yield to Call   

        For preferreds near or already past their call dates, its important to 
        know your potential return should they be called. For instance, say that 
        you pay $26 per share for 7.0% (coupon rate) preferreds originally 
        issued at $25 per share that can be called in 12-months.  Even 
        though you're collecting a nominal 6.7% yield, you would lose $1/share 
        in 12-months if the shares were called at that time. Factoring that in, 
        your actual return, called the "yield to call," would drop to 2.9%. 
        Rather than doing the math yourself, use this
        
        handy calculator to determine your preferred's yield to call. 

Potential Price Appreciation

        Ideally, you would like to buy preferreds below their issue 
        price. Assuming that the issuing corporation is a solid player and won't 
        renege on its dividend obligations, the preferreds will eventually move 
        back up to their issue price. If that happens, you would enjoy capital 
        appreciation in addition to the dividends. For instance, suppose that 
        you buy shares originally issued at $25, but currently trading at $23. 
        Your capital appreciation potential is 8.7%., and your nominal dividend 
        yield is 7.6%. 

        Obviously, thanks to the capital appreciation potential, the call date 
        isn't an issue when you buy preferreds trading below their call price. 
        For example, for the 7.0% coupon preferreds trading at $23, your yield 
        to maturity would be 16.3% if they were called 12-months after you 
        purchased. In practice, though, most companies wouldn't call preferreds 
		trading significantly below their call prices. Instead, they would 
		simply buy them on the open market if they wanted to redeem them.

		Risks 


        Preferred stock investors face three major risk factors: 1) dividend 
        suspension or company failure, 2) rising interest rates, and 3) low 
        trading volumes.  

Preferred Dividend Suspension/Company Failure

        Firms that are facing cash flow problems will be tempted to suspend 
        paying preferred stock dividends, and in the worst case, might file for 
        bankruptcy. Either of those events would sink preferred share prices. 

        Consequently, preferred investors must understand the issuing 
        corporation's fundamental outlook. Preferreds issued by marginal 
        corporations will look tempting because they will be 
        trading at big discounts to their issue price. Thus, be sure to do your 
        homework before buying preferreds in that category. 

        Many preferred stocks are rated by bond rating agencies such as Moody's and 
        Standard & Poor's. They use a combination of letters, numbers, and plus 
        or minus signs such as AAA, BA1 or B- to rate the preferreds.
        The details vary between agencies, but all ratings starting with A, and 
        three letter ratings starting with B, indicate investment quality. 

S&P: 
          Investment quality ratings are AAA, AA, A, and BBB. Below investment 
          quality ( best to worst) are BB, 
        B, CCC, CC, C and D. S&P may add a + or - to indicate 
        that a rating falls near the top or bottom of a rating category. 
Moodys 
          investment quality ratings, are Aaa, Aa, A, and Baa. Below investment 
          quality (best to worst) are Ba, B, Caa, Ca, and C. Moodys may add a 1, 2, or 3 to a rating 
        to indicate that it falls near the top or bottom of a rating category (1 
        is best). 


        Since issuers must pay Moodys or S&P to be rated, not all preferreds 
        are rated. Unrated preferreds arent necessarily risky, but they require 
        more work since youll have to do the financial strength analysis on 
        your own. 

        Beware; bond-analysts sometimes overlook the obvious. For instance, in 
        2007, many didnt realize that falling home prices would 
        reduce the value of mortgages secured by those homes. Thus, its up to 
        you to keep up with the news and avoid industries with obvious problems.
        

Preferred Interest Rate Risk

        After the issuing company's financial outlook, prevailing interest rates are the most important factor controlling 
        preferred share prices. If market rates rise, preferred stock prices will 
        probably drop, and vice versa. Heres why.

        Suppose that you own preferreds paying an initial 6% dividend yield; for 
        instance, a preferred issued at $25 that pays dividends totaling $1.50 
        annually. Now, say that prevailing corporate rates rise to 7%. There 
        would be no market for preferreds paying 6% at $25 per share. Instead, 
        buyers would only be willing pay $21.43 per share. At that price, the 
        $1.50 annual dividend would equate to a 7% return ($1.50 divided by 
        $21.43 is 7%). 

        Conversely, if interest rates drop, investors would be willing to pay 
        more for you shares because they are yielding better than market 
        returns. Thus, the best time to own preferreds is when the outlook for 
        corporate 
        interest rates is steady or headed down. 

Trading Volumes

        Some preferred stocks are not widely followed and are lightly traded. 
        Those are risky business because the lack of trading volume makes it 
        difficult to move in or out of a position at a reasonable price. Avoid 
        preferred stocks trading less than 4,000 shares daily, on average. 


Preferred 
Stock 
Tax 
Issues
 

        For reasons too involved to detail here, the dividends from some 
        preferreds are subject to the maximum 15%/20% dividend tax rate, while 
        others are taxed as ordinary income. That can make a big difference. For 
        instance, $1.00 of dividends taxed at 15% nets out to roughly the same 
        amount as $1.30 taxed at the maximum 35% ordinary tax rate. For each 
        preferred, Quantum Online (www.quantumonline.com) 
        specifies whether the 15%/20% maximum rate applies. 

        Corporations that have invested in other firms preferred shares, in 
        most instances, enjoy a dividend received deduction that allows them to 
        exclude 70% of dividends received from their taxable income. Quantum 
        Online also specifies whether each preferred qualifies for the corporate 
        dividend received deduction.
        

How
        To

		Evaluate 

		Preferred 
        
        Stocks

        Evaluate preferreds by analyzing the issuing companys financial 
        strength. Whats important is that the firm has the cash to pay its 
        dividends. It doesnt matter if the issuers earnings came in below 
        analysts estimates or it said next quarter sales would be lower than 
        previously forecast. 
Here 
        are some selection criteria to keep in mind.
  
		Current Price vs. Call Price: ideally, the current preferred trading 
		price would be below the call price, and should never be more than 15% 
		above the call price. 
  
        Credit Rating: conservative investors should stick with investment grade (any rating starting with "A" 
        and three-letter "B" ratings).
  
        Trading Volume: minimum 4,000 shares, traded daily, on average.
  
		Issuers common stock trading price: minimum $5 and higher is better. 
  
        Issuing Company Analyst Consensus Buy/Sell Rating: hold or better. 
  
        Issuing Company Return on Assets: 6% or higher. 
  
        Issuing Company trailing 12-months (TTM) Operating Cash Flow: positive.

Preferred 
Stock 
Glossary

Adjustable Rate: annual dividend varies depending on predefined 
        factors. 

Baby Bonds: same as Senior Notes (see below). 

Callable: issuer has the right to redeem shares at issue price 
        after a specified date. 

Call Date: earliest date that shares can be called. Usually five 
        years after issue date. 

Call Price: price issuer will pay for redeemed shares. Usually 
        the same as the issue price. 

Convertible: holders have the right to convert preferred shares 
        to common stock at predetermined ratio after specified date. This gives 
        preferred holders a chance to benefit from the common stocks share 
        price appreciation. 

Coupon Rate: yield based on initial issue price 

Cumulative: skipped dividends must still be paid before common 
        stock dividends are paid and before the shares are redeemed. 

Current Yield: yield based on current share price.

CUSIP: unique identifier for each security. 

Exchange-Traded Debt Securities: a.k.a. Preferred Equity Traded 
        (PET) Bonds or Junior Subordinated Debentures. Debt securities such as 
        debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These unsecured debt 
        instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to preferred and common 
        stocks. 

Ex-Dividend Date: you must purchase shares prior to the 
        ex-dividend date to receive the corresponding payout. 

Issue Price: original share price. 

Liquidation Value: same as issue price. 

Market Yield: same as current yield. 

Maturity Date: the date the preferred shares must be redeemed by 
        the issuing firm, typically 30 to 100 years after issue. 

Non-Cumulative: depending on the preferred, skipped dividends can 
		be delayed for five-years, or even indefinitely.  Unlike failing to 
		pay required bond interest payments, preferred issuers are not "in 
		default" if they skip preferred dividends. 

        However, skipped 
		dividends must still be paid before common stock dividends are paid and 
		before the shares are redeemed. 

Par Value: same as issue price 

Participating: annual dividend varies depending on firms net 
        income or dividends paid to common shareholders. 

PINES (Public Income Notes): a.k.a. QUIBS (Quarterly Interest 
        Bonds) or QUIDS (Quarterly Income Debt Securities). Debt securities such 
        as debentures, notes and bonds that trade like stocks. These senior 
        unsecured debt instruments rank below secured debt, but senior to 
        preferred and common stocks. 

Redeemable: same as callable. 

Redemption Date: same as call date. 

Senior Notes: Issuers cannot skip preferred interest payments 
		(dividends) without going into default. 

Third Party Trust Preferred: a Trust Preferred issued by a third 
        party such as an underwriter. 

Trust Preferred Securities: a cumulative preferred variation that provides certain 
        income tax and accounting advantages over traditional preferreds to the 
        issuer, but not for the shareholder. Instead of selling preferreds 
        directly, a corporation sets up a special trust that buys debt 
        securities from the corporation and, in turn, issues preferred shares. If the issuer suspends dividends, shareholders may still be 
        liable for income taxes on the unpaid dividends. TruPS - Trust Preferred 
        Securities are Smith Barney's brand name for Trust Preferreds. 
        TOPrS - Trust Originated Preferred Securities are Merrill Lynch's 
        brand name for Trust Preferreds. 

Yield to Call: return you would receive assuming the preferred is 
        redeemed on the call date.
Yield to Maturity: return you would receive assuming the 
        preferred is redeemed on its maturity date.
