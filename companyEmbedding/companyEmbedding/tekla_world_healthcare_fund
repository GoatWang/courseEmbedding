THQ: This New Healthcare CEF Looks Positioned To Move Higher - Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund (NYSE:THQ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»THQ: This New Healthcare CEF Looks Positioned To Move HigherMar.19.15 | About: Tekla Healthcare (THQ) Value and Income Insights Long only, value, special situations, contrarianSummaryHealthcare stocks are poised to benefit from demographic trends.New technologies including immunotherapy and personalized medicine will drive healthcare stocks higher.This fund should benefit from its strong management team with a proven track record in managing closed-end funds.Overview:
Healthcare stocks have been strong performers for the past several years. The sector is benefiting from higher utilization rates due to demographic trends and increased access to healthcare because of the Affordable Care Act. The Tekla Healthcare Opportunities Fund (NYSE:THQ) is a closed-end fund that was launched in 2014 to invest in the healthcare sector. THQ is managed by Tekla Capital Management which also manages two other closed-end funds, Tekla Life Sciences Investors (NYSE:HQL) and Tekla Healthcare Investors (NYSE:HQH), both of which have attractive performance track records.
The market is currently offering THQ at a 9.94% discount to NAV. This wide discount is attractive on an absolute basis. It is also an attractive discount on a relative basis when compared to other funds managed by Tekla. Currently, HQL trades at a 0.50% premium and HQH trades at a 2.18% premium. The ability to access a strong management team trading at a wide discount is attractive. The investment case for THQ is bolstered by the strong tailwinds in the healthcare sector and the fund's 6.71% distribution.
Key Investment Highlights:


New Technologies: There has been a significant amount of innovation in the healthcare sector in the past 10 years. The Human Genome Project, which mapped the human genome, was completed in 2003 and has provided significant insight into the human body. This insight has translated into a wide range of new technologies including personalized medicine and immunotherapy. These insights have led to new drug development with the FDA approving 44 drugs in 2014 which is the most since 1996. Continued innovation should help drive earnings for healthcare companies.

Increasing Demand: The demand for healthcare is expected to continue to increase driven by aging demographics and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). People spend more on healthcare as they get older. In the US, the baby boomers are getting older and increasing their use of healthcare products and services. The ACA is also expected to increase utilization, as it will give more people access to healthcare insurance. The requirement to have healthcare insurance should also increase the percentage of paying customers, reducing charity care and improving healthcare company profitability. These trends should provide a tailwind for healthcare stocks for years to come.

Strong Management Team: Tekla Capital Management has shown strong performance in the other healthcare focused CEFs that they manage. HQH has posted a 14.52% annual NAV return for the 10-year period ending 2/28/2015. HQL has posted a 14.42% annual NAV return for the 10-year period ending 2/28/2015. Both of these returns compare favorably to the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLV) which has a 10-year average annual return of 11.07%. These returns show that the Tekla management team has the ability to post attractive returns. THQ should benefit from this strong management team.

Discount to NAV: THQ is trading at a 9.94% discount to NAV and offers a 6.71% distribution. The fund's discount is likely driven in part by technical aspects of CEF trading. CEFs IPO at a premium and often swing to a discount over time. While average historical discounts aren't available due to THQ's recent launch, other funds managed by Tekla trade at premiums to their NAV. It would not be surprising for the discount to narrow over time if THQ posts strong performance.


Key Investment Risks:

Healthcare Valuations: Some market participants have voiced concern about valuations in the market overall and the healthcare sector in particular. Using the XLV as a proxy for healthcare stocks and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) as a proxy for the market, we can see that XLV currently trades at higher valuations. The forward P/E ratio, Price/Book ratio, and PEG ratio are all higher than the S&P, while the dividend yield is lower.

Source: SPDRS.com as of 3/18/2015
Investors should be aware of these higher valuations and consider them as well as the tailwinds for the healthcare sector mentioned above before investing.


Pharmaceutical Patent Cliffs and Biosimilars: Many blockbuster drugs are beginning to lose patent protection, allowing generic competition. Additionally, there is a likelihood that biosimilar drugs will be launched in coming years to provide alternatives to large molecule biologic drugs that have lost their patent protection. The launch of generic drugs will have a negative effect on many pharmaceutical companies' revenues and margins. However, this risk cuts both ways for the healthcare sector overall, as it could drive pharmaceutical companies to make acquisitions. The expiration of patent protection also offers opportunities for companies manufacturing the generic drugs.

Pricing Pressure from PBMs: Many new drugs are coming to market with very high price tags. This is causing concern for healthcare payers. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) have started to fight back and attempt to get pricing concessions. They are limiting covered drugs and pressuring patients to take lower cost products. They are also working to get drug companies to compete for a spot of the formularies based on price. This focus on high priced drugs and the coming pricing pressure could pressure margins for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.


Key Portfolio Metrics:

Market Capitalization: $883 Million
Average Daily Volume (Shares): 193,000
Portfolio Turnover: 19.6%
Premium/Discount: -9.94%
Current Monthly Distribution: $0.1125
Market Distribution Rate: 6.71%
NAV Distribution Rate: 6.13%
Effective Leverage: 0%

Performance:
Using ETFs with similar investment objectives gives a good comparison to allow for evaluation of the fund management's performance. THQ invests in the healthcare sector primarily in US companies so XLV provides a good proxy. So far, THQ's NAV performance has been in line with or exceeded XLV. However, THQ is a new fund having launched on 7/28/2014 so there isn't a significant track record available to judge performance. Market price performance for THQ has trailed as the fund has moved from a premium at IPO to the current 9.94% discount.

Data as of 2/28/2015. Source: Morningstar
Premium/Discount:

Source: CEFConnect
The fund closed 3/18/2015 at a 9.94% discount to the NAV, or underlying value of the portfolio. Because of the short trading record of the fund, there isn't a 1-year average available with which to compare the discount. THQ lost its IPO premium in 2014 and has traded with a persistent discount in 2015. However, other healthcare funds managed by Tekla trade at a premium to NAV. THQ could offer an attractive entry point at the current discount.
Expense Ratio:
The management fee is 1% of daily managed assets. The fund has also entered into a services agreement with the advisor. The annualized management fee and other expenses came to 1.28% in 2014. The total expense ratio for the fund is in line or below expectations for a sector specific fund.

Distribution:
THQ pays a monthly managed distribution. The current distribution is $0.1125/share. This equates to an annual distribution yield of 6.71% based on current market prices.
Leverage:
THQ uses an options overlay but currently does not employ other leverage.
Liquidity:
THQ is a medium-sized CEF with $980 million in net assets. Trading volume is robust, with 193,000 shares traded on an average day. Trading volume represents $3.68 million in daily volume at current prices. This offers a reasonable amount of liquidity for a CEF. Individual investors should not have problems getting orders filled. It is always wise to use limit orders to purchase or sell shares of closed-end funds, as the bid/ask spread can be wide.
Management:
THQ is managed by Tekla Capital Management. Tekla has a talented management team focused on healthcare. Tekla is a relatively unknown investment manager focused on the healthcare sector. THQ is one of three funds managed by Tekla. The performance track record of the other Tekla funds has been strong providing confidence that THQ's management team has the ability to pick stocks that will outperform.
Portfolio:
Asset Allocation

Source: Tekla as of 12/31/2014
Currently, the portfolio is primarily invested in common stocks. The portfolio does hold some fixed income and convertible securities. The fund is expected to be a total return vehicle that will hold fixed income to help protect capital in bear markets. Due to the recent launch, the fund does hold an elevated level of cash. This will allow the fund to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Industry Allocation


Source: Tekla as of 12/31/2014
THQ has a diverse portfolio of healthcare stocks with representation from most healthcare industries. The fund does have a large allocation to biotechnology companies. This bet has paid off as biotech companies have been some of the strongest performing stocks recently.
Top Holdings

Source: Tekla as of 12/31/2014
THQ has a relatively concentrated portfolio with only 63 holdings and 35.5% of assets in the top 10 holdings. It will be important to watch the fund's turnover as it matures. Other funds managed by Tekla have relatively low turnover. HQH has an annual turnover of 29% and HQL has an annual turnover of 31%. The inclusion of fixed income and the use of an options strategy may contribute to a higher turnover in this fund relative to other funds managed by Tekla.
Strategy:
THQ's investment objective is to seek current income and long-term capital appreciation through investment in companies engaged in the healthcare industry. THQ will invest in equity securities, debt securities, and pooled investment vehicles. The fund uses an option selling strategy to enhance distributions from the portfolio.
Options:
THQ sells options from time to time to generate additional income on the portfolio.
Conclusion:
THQ is an attractive investment taking advantage of new healthcare technology and demographic trends. Increasing healthcare utilization driven by the Affordable Care Act should also provide a tailwind. While the CEF is relatively new it is managed by the experienced team at Tekla Capital Management, which has proven successful managing other healthcare focused CEFs. THQ's current discount to NAV offers an attractive entry point. Shareholders should also benefit from the 6.71% distribution.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap N/A     Shares Outstanding 43.88 M     Public Float N/A     Yield 7.28% (07/28/17)      Latest Dividend $0.1125 (07/31/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 07/13/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.18      Net Money Flow ()  87,551    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

It is currently estimated that this distribution is derived from net investment income and short-term capital gains. The composition of this and subsequent distributions may vary from month to month because it may be materially impacted by future realized gains and losses on securities. The aggregate of the net unrealized depreciation of portfolio securities and net realized gains on sale of securities is -$67,918,471, of which $88,813,124 represents net unrealized depreciation of portfolio securities.The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution, paid on June 30, 2017, and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the following sources: net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, return of capital or other capital source. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you have invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. All amounts are expressed per common share.                                       CurrentDistribution         PercentageBreakdown of CurrentDistribution         Total CumulativeDistributions for theFiscal Year to Date1         Percentage Breakdownof the Total CumulativeDistributions for theFiscal Year to Date1      Net Investment Income       $0.0055       5   %       $0.2172       21   %     Net Realized ST Cap Gains       $0.1112       95   %       $0.6212       59   %     Net Realized LT Cap Gains       $0.0000       0   %       $0.0644       6   %     Return of Capital or Other Capital Source       $0.0000       0   %       $0.1475       14   %     TOTAL (per common share):       $0.1167       100   %       $1.0503       100   %                        The table below includes information relating to the Fund’s performance based on its NAV for certain periods.            Average annual return at NAV for the period from inception through May 31, 20172       -2.60   %     Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of May 31, 2017       9.23   %     Cumulative total return at NAV for the fiscal year, through May 31, 20173       0.89   %     Cumulative fiscal year-to-date distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of May 31, 20171       6.92   %            You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy.The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this press release are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.
