Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1999 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. 562 pages.

Item Description: Materials Research Society. Hardback. Book Condition: new. BRAND NEW, Oxide Semiconductors and Thin Films, Andre Schleife, Martin Allen, Craig B. Arnold, Steven Durbin, Nini Pryds, Symposium Z, 'Oxide Semiconductors', and Symposium F, 'Oxide Thin Films for Renewable Energy Applications', were held November 25-30 at the 2012 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. Oxide materials are attracting considerable attention both as semiconductors for a wide range of potential device applications but also in energy research spanning from photo- and electro-catalysis, to electrolytes and electrodes used in batteries or fuel cells. This symposium proceedings volume collects recent reports from the meeting aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of bulk oxide materials as well as thin films and nano-structures. The topics covered in this volume are quite broad and include such areas as growth and doping, defects and characterisation, and device applications.  Bookseller Inventory # B9781605114712

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
