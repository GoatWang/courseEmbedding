Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Canadian Banks












Rating Action: Moody's Places Bank of Nova Scotia's Ratings Under Review






                    Global Credit Research - 02 Nov 2015
                









Toronto, November 02, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has placed the long term ratings, Counterparty 
Risk Assessment and Baseline Credit Assessment of Bank of Nova Scotia 
(BNS, Aa2/Aa2 negative, a1) and its subsidiaries on review 
for downgrade, and affirmed BNS's Prime-1 short-term 
deposit rating, short-term Counterparty Risk Assessment and 
other short term ratings. The impacted entities are listed below:




Bank of Nova Scotia


Bank of Nova Scotia, Houston Branch


Bank of Nova Scotia, New York Agency


Montreal Trust Company of Canada


Scotiabank Capital Trust


Scotiabanc Inc.


Scotiabank Europe Plc


Scotiabank Tier 1 Trust






RATINGS RATIONALE




Moody's said the review was prompted by BNS having taken significant 
measures to increase its profitability that signal a fundamental shift 
away from the bank's traditionally low risk appetite. These 
strategic actions are intended to enhance current profitability (BNS reports 
the lowest domestic net interest margin of the six largest Canadian banks), 
but in Moody's view increase the prospect of future incremental 
credit losses when the credit cycle turns. 




Over the last two years, BNS has accelerated the growth in its credit 
card and auto finance portfolios, in accordance with its strategic 
initiatives to expand these portfolios, both of which are particularly 
prone to rapid deterioration during an economic shock and exhibit higher 
defaults and loss severities than mortgage portfolios. Personal 
and credit cards loans grew at a CAGR of 8% over the past two years, 
the highest among the six large Canadian peer banks. In addition, 
BNS has made a series of acquisitions away from its strong domestic franchise 
towards higher-growth but less stable international markets.




During the review period, Moody's will review the likelihood 
that BNS's increased risk tolerance and strategic imperative to 
increase profitability by shifting the asset mix towards higher yielding 
categories of consumer credit, both domestically and in international 
operations, will persist. Moody's will also undertake 
further analysis of the operating environments of the regions outside 
of Canada where BNS operates, and the bank's strategy and 
performance in these regions. Moody's will also assess the 
implications of the shift in risk tolerance, balanced against the 
strategic plan to enhance profitability and shareholder returns.




Given the direction of the review, upward pressure on the rating 
is unlikely. Downward pressure will depend upon our assessment 
of the items noted above as the focus of our review.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Banks published in 
March 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity.

if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




The ratings have been disclosed to the rated entities or their designated 
agent(s) and issued with no amendment resulting from that disclosure.

related third parties and/or the party that requested the rating within 
the past two years (including during the most recently ended fiscal year).

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Rating Action: Moody's affirms Canadian bank ratings and assigns counterparty risk assessments






                    Global Credit Research - 30 Apr 2015
                









NOTE: On May 15, 2015, the press release was corrected as follows:  The following sentence was added to the first paragraph of the press release:  “The rationale for the affirmation of these  ratings is the continuation of their key strengths; superior asset quality and  strong stable earnings capacity supported by a stable operating environment”; the following was added as the second paragraph of the Ratings Rationale section: “The Canadian banks are very highly rated and there is little prospect for upward movement in their ratings at this time. The following factors would result in downward ratings pressure: i) a significant deterioration in the operating environment, ii) a significant increase in consumer loan losses, and/or iii) a significant change in business mix resulting in increased reliance upon capital markets earnings and/or earnings from less well positioned international operations.”  Revised release follows.




Toronto, April 30, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has today affirmed the long-term ratings 
on the six largest Canadian banks and two other deposit-taking 
issuers, as well as the negative outlook for the supported senior 
debt and uninsured deposit ratings of seven of those financial institutions. 
The rationale for the affirmation of these  ratings is the continuation of their key strengths; superior asset quality and  strong stable earnings capacity supported by a stable operating environment. Although Moody's very high systemic support assumptions remain unchanged, 
the negative rating outlooks reflect the possibility it may reduce its 
systemic support assumptions in the future.




RATINGS RATIONALE




The negative outlooks are based on Moody's expectation that, 
within the next several weeks, the Canadian authorities will provide 
more details on the resolution policy for domestic systemically important 
banks. Once the details of the bail-in regime are announced, 
Moody's will evaluate the feasibility of the government's implementing 
a bail-in of senior creditors while maintaining financial stability 
and limiting any damage to the broader economy.




The Canadian banks are very highly rated and there is little prospect for upward movement in their ratings at this time. The following factors would result in downward ratings pressure: i) a significant deterioration in the operating environment, ii) a significant increase in consumer loan losses, and/or iii) a significant change in business mix resulting in increased reliance upon capital markets earnings and/or earnings from less well positioned international operations.




For its own business reasons, Moody's has withdrawn the outlooks 
for all subordinated instrument ratings of the Canadian banks. 
Please refer to Moody's Investors Service's Policy for Withdrawal 
of Credit Ratings, available on its website, www.moodys.com. 
Outlooks, which indicate the direction of rating pressures, 
are now only assigned to long term senior debt and deposit ratings.




Moody's also assigned Counterparty Risk Assessments (CR Assessments) 
to eight Canadian banks and deposit-taking issuers. CR Assessments 
are opinions of how counterparty obligations are likely to be treated 
if a bank fails, and are distinct from debt and deposit ratings 
in that they (1) consider only the risk of default rather than the likelihood 
of default and the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default 
and (2) apply to counterparty obligations and contractual commitments 
rather than debt or deposit instruments. The CR Assessments are 
an opinion of the counterparty risk related to a bank's covered 
bonds, contractual performance obligations (servicing), derivatives 
(e.g., swaps), letters of credit, guarantees 
and liquidity facilities.




In most cases, the starting point for the CR Assessment -- 
which is an assessment of the ability to avoid defaulting on its operating 
obligations -- is one notch above the bank's Adjusted BCA, 
to which Moody's then adds the same notches of support uplift as 
applied to deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings.




As a result, the CR Assessment for most Canadian banks is one notch 
higher than their senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings, reflecting 
Moody's view that authorities are likely to honor the operating 
obligations the CR Assessment refers to in order to preserve a bank's 
critical functions and reduce potential for contagion.




However, in the case of The Toronto-Dominion Bank, 
given its very high senior unsecured debt rating -- at Aa1 -- 
Moody's has also assigned a CR Assessment of Aa1(cr).




"The ongoing evolution of banking resolution tools that include 
debt bail-in underscores the need to differentiate counterparty 
risk from bank debt ratings." said David Beattie, a 
Moody's Senior Vice President. "We believe that, 
although debt obligations and other capital instruments may be subject 
to loss in a resolution, counterparty obligations may be shielded 
in order to preserve the continuity of operations and avoid contagion." 





A list of the affected credit ratings is available at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF405899. 
This list is an integral part of this press release and identifies all 
of the affected issuers.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Banks published in 
March 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.

Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Canadian Banks






                    Global Credit Research - 10 May 2017
                










Note: On June 9, 2017 the press release was corrected as follows: The list of affected credit ratings accessible via hyperlink from this press release was corrected. Revised release follows.

Note: On May 31, 2017 the press release was corrected as follows:  The second sentence of the sixth paragraph of the Regulatory Disclosures section was changed to include the correct list of issuers. Revised release follows.


Toronto, May 10, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has today 
downgraded the Baseline Credit Assessments (BCAs), the long-term 
ratings and the Counterparty Risk Assessments (CRAs) of six Canadian banks 
and their affiliates, reflecting Moody's expectation of a 
more challenging operating environment for banks in Canada for the remainder 
of 2017 and beyond, that could lead to a deterioration in the banks' 
asset quality, and increase their sensitivity to external shocks.




The banks affected are: Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank 
of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce, National Bank of Canada, and Royal Bank of Canada.




The BCAs, long-term debt and deposit ratings and CRAs of 
the banks and their affiliates were downgraded by 1 notch, excepting 
only Toronto-Dominion Bank's CRA, which was affirmed. 
The short term Prime-1 ratings of the Canadian banks were affirmed. 
All relevant ratings for these banks continue to have negative outlooks, 
reflecting the expected introduction of an operational resolution regime 
in Canada.




"Today's downgrade of the Canadian banks reflects our ongoing concerns 
that expanding levels of private-sector debt could weaken asset 
quality in the future. Continued growth in Canadian consumer debt 
and elevated housing prices leaves consumers, and Canadian banks, 
more vulnerable to downside risks facing the Canadian economy than in 
the past." said David Beattie, a Moody's Senior Vice President.




In the same action, Moody's affirmed the BCAs, long-term 
ratings and CRAs of CIBC Mellon Trust (CIBC Mellon), the Fédération 
des caisses Desjardins du Québec (the Fédération) 
and Caisse centrale Desjardins.




In view of today's actions, Moody's does not expect any upward 
rating pressure on the affected banks in the near term. However, 
the Canadian banks' ratings could be revised upwards if macro-economic 
conditions in Canada improve and the Canadian banks maintain sound financial 
metrics.




The affected banks' ratings could be downgraded if their fundamentals 
weaken, as evidenced by an even more challenging operating environment 
and/or deterioration in their financial metrics.




Please click on the following link to access the full list of affected 
credit ratings, not all of which are discussed in the summary above. 
This list is an integral part of this press release and identifies each 
affected issuer. (http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_195571)




MACRO PROFILE CHANGE




Under Moody's bank rating methodology, the first stage of 
our credit analysis for banks starts with the Macro Profile, our 
assessment of the macro environment within which a bank operates. 
This reflects our view that bank failures are very often associated with 
systemic crises driven by macroeconomics rather than idiosyncratic factors. 
Our country level analysis focuses on economic strength, institutional 
strength, susceptibility to event risk, credit conditions, 
funding conditions and industry structure. In today's action, 
Moody's has changed its assessment of Canada's Macro Profile to 
"Strong + "from "Very Strong -". This change 
was driven by our view that the credit conditions in Canada have deteriorated. 
High levels of debt and rapid credit expansion can signal credit quality 
problems that emerge later. In assessing a given country's 
credit conditions, we consider the level of private-sector 
debt to GDP and the growth in private sector debt. Please refer 
to our "Sector In-Depth; Canada Macro Profile: 
Strong +" (http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1071643)

for the List of Affected Credit Ratings. This list is an integral 
part of this Press Release and identifies each affected issuer.




RATINGS RATIONALE




Moody's considers that weakening credit conditions in Canada -- 
including an increase in private-sector debt to GDP to 185.0% 
as of the end of 2016, up from 179.3% for 2015 -- 
present increasing risk to Canadian banks' asset quality and profitability. 
This increase has been led by household debt, which is now at a 
record high of 167.3% of disposable income (as at Q4 2016) 
and accompanying house price appreciation. Despite macro-prudential 
measures put into place by Canadian policymakers in recent years -- 
which have had some success in moderating the rate of housing price growth 
-- house prices and consumer debt levels remain historically high. 
Business credit, the other component of private-sector debt, 
has also grown rapidly, at a 6.2% CAGR over the past 
3 years. We do note that the Canadian banks maintain strong buffers 
in terms of capital and liquidity. However, the resilience 
of household balance sheets, and consequently bank portfolios, 
to a serious economic downturn has not been tested at these levels of 
private sector indebtedness.




Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD, Aa2/Aa2 negative, a1); 
TD's strong ratings are attributable to its very strong domestic retail 
franchise -- which generates stable and recurring profitability and 
its business mix. This strength is due to leading market share 
positions in many personal & commercial financial services products, 
where TD typically has market shares in the high teens and holds first 
or second positions.




TD is the most retail oriented of its Canadian peers, with approximately 
90% of earnings coming from retail (combined Canadian personal 
& commercial, wealth management and US personal & commercial, 
excluding corporate). While CM income has increased over recent 
quarters and capital allocated to the wholesale business is rising, 
we expect that reliance on this inherently volatile source of income will 
remain relatively modest.




Through acquisition and organic growth, TD has increased its exposure 
to unsecured Canadian consumer credit risk in recent years. In 
our view, however, the strength and stability of the earnings 
from TD's Canadian personal and commercial banking franchise remain the 
primary credit strength supporting its ratings. The ratings of 
TD's US affiliates benefit from support from the parent, and 
as such are also affected by this action.




Bank of Montreal (BMO A1/A1 negative, a3); BMO is one of the 
six major banks in Canada which benefit from the protection of significant 
barriers to entry and the stability of a prudent regulatory environment. 
Although its Canadian retail market shares are towards the lower end of 
the Canadian peer group, BMO has double digit market shares across 
all significant retail financial services and products, providing 
scale and recurring earnings power in its home market. In our view, 
however, the strength and stability of the earnings from BMO's Canadian 
personal and commercial (P&C) banking franchise remain the primary 
credit strength supporting its ratings. BMO has a strong and improving 
US regional banking presence through BMO Harris, which adds important 
diversification away from reliance on Canadian P&C earnings. 
However, BMO does not enjoy the same franchise strength and pricing 
power in the more competitive US market that it does in Canada. 
The ratings of BMO Harris and affiliates benefit from support from the 
parent, and as such are also affected by this action.




Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS A1/A1 negative, a3); BNS is the most 
internationally active of the Canadian banks with approximately half of 
its earnings generated outside of Canada. BNS has taken significant 
measures to increase its profitability that signal a fundamental shift 
away from the bank's traditionally low risk appetite. While the 
bank's strategic actions are intended to enhance current profitability 
-- in 2016, BNS reported domestic net interest margin lower 
than the six largest Canadian banks' average- in our view, 
they increase the prospect of future incremental credit losses.




While BNS had strategically grown its credit card and auto finance portfolios 
- both of which are particularly prone to deterioration during 
an economic downturn and exhibit higher defaults and loss severities than 
mortgage portfolios -- in recent years, growth in 2016 was 
flat. In addition, the bank has made a series of acquisitions 
away from its strong domestic franchise towards higher-growth but 
less stable international markets. BNS has aspirations to continue 
to grow its international earnings, which in Moody's view adds to 
bondholder risk.




Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC A1/A1 negative, a3); 
CIBC is the most reliant of the Canadian banks on domestic P&C earnings, 
which generate approximately 65% of total earnings, excluding 
Corporate. In our view, however, the strength and stability 
of the earnings from CIBC's Canadian personal and commercial banking franchise 
remain the primary credit strength supporting its ratings. CIBC 
has the second lowest proportionate exposure to unsecured and non-real 
estate secured consumer debt as a percentage of domestic consumer assets 
(roughly 11.5%), reflective of its very large book 
of insured mortgages.




CIBC is one of the six major banks in Canada that benefit from the protection 
of significant barriers to entry and the stability of a prudent regulatory 
environment. Although its Canadian retail market shares are mid-range 
relative to its Canadian peers, CIBC has solid double digit market 
shares across all significant retail financial services and products, 
providing scale and recurring earnings.




National Bank of Canada (NBC A1/A1 negative, baa1); NBC's dominant 
position in commercial banking and strong second place share of market 
in retail banking in Québec are the primary credit strengths supporting 
its high ratings. The stability of the recurring earnings power 
of NBC's regional retail franchise is, in Moody's view, highly 
unlikely to be challenged. That being said, NBC's asset base 
(CAD234 billion as of Q1 2017) and national deposit share (roughly 4%) 
are small relative to the other large Canadian banks whose branch systems 
are more national in scale. In our view, however, the 
strength and stability of the earnings from NBC's Canadian personal and 
commercial banking franchise remain the primary credit strength supporting 
its ratings.




While each of the major Canadian banks enjoys the benefits of superior 
pricing power due to sustainable large market shares in many significant 
retail and commercial products and services, this is true for NBC 
only in the context of its regional market, the province of Québec. 
As such, the challenges in geographic diversification and earnings 
stability and the Québec credit concentrations offset partially 
the strength in local market share and sustainability. NBC is the 
Canadian bank most reliant upon inherently less stable capital markets 
earnings, which generated 38% of total earnings, excluding 
Corporate for 2016 (38% for 2015.)




Royal Bank of Canada (RBC A1/A1 negative, a3 ); RBC's ratings 
reflect its profile as a strong and diversified universal bank with sustainable 
leading market shares across many retail products and services in its 
home market. The stable earnings from RBC's domestic Personal and 
Commercial franchise are a key credit strength. RBC has had very 
low earnings volatility, supported by the stabilizing effect of 
the recurring profitability of RBC's solid domestic retail banking franchise.




However, over the past four years RBC has demonstrated rapid growth 
in its Capital Markets business, led by growth in its US corporate 
loan book and the repo and securities finance business. We believe 
that RBC's US-focused Capital Markets growth strategy increases 
its exposure to risks that could more rapidly erode its creditworthiness 
in volatile or adverse market conditions, and is therefore negative 
for the credit. To date, this risk has been well managed 
and its performance has been very stable. Maintaining this performance 
through more volatile markets will be key to RBC's longer term risk management 
track record. We do not expect that this business will continue 
on this growth trajectory, and, in fact, that capital 
committed to the Capital Markets business will be more constrained.




Management plans to substantially grow the earnings of its recently acquired, 
California-based private and commercial bank, City National 
Bank, (deposits Aa3 stable, a2) both organically and through 
targeted acquisitions. Growth in the City National business presents 
less credit risk than continued growth in the Capital Markets area, 
in our view.




The ratings of two affiliates, RBC Capital Markets LLC and RBC (Barbados) 
Trading Bank Corporation were also affected by this action. In 
each case, both long and short term ratings were downgraded.




Fédération des caisses Desjardins du Québec (Aa2/Aa2 
negative, a1 ); The Fédération is a cooperative 
entity responsible for governance and oversight activities for Desjardins 
Group (the Group). It acts as a control and supervisory body over 
the individual member caisses. The Fédération's 
pivotal importance to the Group's operations and performance, the 
application of regulatory supervision to the Group as a whole, as 
well as the strong strategic and financial cohesion among member caisses 
with a well-developed mutualist support framework, lead us 
to factor the strength of the Group into the Fédération's 
BCA.




The Group has a secure retail banking franchise in rural Québec 
as well as strong capitalization and limited reliance on wholesale funding. 
Its regional banking concentration in Québec is offset in part 
by the Group's national insurance and wealth management business.




The Fédération's ratings were affirmed despite the 
Macro Profile change because Moody's believes its operations to 
be largely isolated to the province of Quebec (which has experienced lower 
house price appreciation than other provinces) and because a large proportion 
of Desjardins' net income is derived from non-banking sources, 
such as life and property and casualty insurance.




CIBC Mellon Trust (CIBC Mellon A1/A1 stable, a1); CIBC Mellon 
is a major player in the Canadian custody market, underpinning its 
franchise value. The operations and technology platform provided 
by BNY Mellon lends a further competitive advantage. BNY Mellon 
is the largest custodian, globally, and its operating platform 
allows CIBC Mellon to benefit from economies of scale and service not 
available to its primary domestic competitor.




CIBC Mellon's risk management and control environment is strong, 
with an appropriate emphasis on operational risk issues and effective 
supervision by the joint venture's owners. CMT does not make loans 
(other than short-term overdrafts to custody clients) but incurs 
credit risk through its securities portfolio. The investment portfolio 
is made up largely of short-duration Canadian government and provincial 
bonds as well as corporate debt.




CIBC Mellon's ratings were affirmed despite the change in the Macro 
Profile because Moody's believes its custody bank business model 
is directly unaffected by high consumer debt as it does not lend to consumers.

                    Global Credit Research - 25 Jan 2016
                









Toronto, January 25, 2016 -- Today, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the long term debt and 
deposit ratings of Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) and its subsidiaries to Aa3 
from Aa2, its long term counterparty risk assessment to Aa2(cr) 
from Aa1(cr) and its baseline credit assessment to a2 from a1. 
Moody's also downgraded BNS's senior unsecured shelf and deposit note 
program ratings to (P)Aa3 from (P)Aa2 and subordinate shelf ratings to 
(P)A3 from (P)A2. Subordinated debt and non-cumulative preferred 
share obligations are also downgraded according to Moody's standard notching 
convention. Meanwhile Moody's affirmed BNS's Prime-1 
short-term deposit rating, short-term Counterparty 
Risk Assessment and other short term ratings. The outlook for all 
BNS ratings is negative, reflecting Moody's view that the 
balance of risk related to government support has shifted to the downside. 
The affected entities are listed below: 




Bank of Nova Scotia


Bank of Nova Scotia, Houston Branch


Bank of Nova Scotia, New York Agency


Montreal Trust Company of Canada


Scotiabank Capital Trust


Scotiabanc Inc.


Scotiabank Europe Plc


Scotiabank Tier 1 Trust




RATINGS RATIONALE




Moody's said the ratings change was prompted by Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) 
having taken significant measures to increase its profitability that signal 
a fundamental shift away from the bank's traditionally low risk appetite. 
This risk positioning was a key part of the rationale for what had been 
its superior credit standing. While the bank's strategic 
actions are intended to enhance current profitability -- BNS reports 
the lowest domestic net interest margin of the six largest Canadian banks 
-- in Moody's view, they increase the prospect of future incremental 
credit losses.




Over the last two years, in accordance with its strategic initiatives, 
BNS has accelerated the growth in its credit card and auto finance portfolios 
-- both of which are particularly prone to deterioration during an 
economic downturn and exhibit higher defaults and loss severities than 
mortgage portfolios. In addition, the bank has made a series 
of acquisitions away from its strong domestic franchise towards higher-growth 
but less stable international markets. BNS has aspirations to continue 
to grow its international earnings, which in Moody's view adds to 
bondholder risk.




Moody's believes it is likely that BNS's increased risk tolerance and 
strategic imperative to increase profitability by shifting the asset mix 
towards higher yielding categories of consumer credit, both domestically 
and in international operations, will persist.




WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP/DOWN




Given its very high ratings, upward rating pressure on BNS is unlikely.




Downward pressure will depend upon future trends in business mix and asset 
quality. Significantly increased exposure to credit card and auto 
finance portfolios, substantially increased reliance on earnings 
from international operations and/or, unexpected profitability erosion 
or control problems would be credit negative.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Banks published in 
January 2016. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




The ratings have been disclosed to the rated entities or their designated 
agent(s) and issued with no amendment resulting from that disclosure.




Moody's has not provided advisory services but may have provided 
Ancillary or Other Permissible Service(s) to the rated entity, its 
related third parties and/or the party that requested the rating within 
the past two years (including during the most recently ended fiscal year). 
Please see the special report "Ancillary or other permissible services 
provided to entities rated by MIS's credit rating agency in Canada" 
on the ratings disclosure page www.moodys.com/disclosures 
on our website for further information.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
