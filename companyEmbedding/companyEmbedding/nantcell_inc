FALSE REPORTING
While it is not befitting for us to dignify false reporting or be distracted by false claims, both an online health trade publication and an online political publication, published articles containing numerous inaccuracies. Letters we wrote to these publications, pointing out those inaccuracies, are posted on NantHealth’s website. As just one example:
The reporter stated, that NantWorks purchased the Jefferson property from the foundation for $6 million. That statement is false. What is worse, the reporter had the facts before he published the article, that NantWorks in fact paid $15.5M. Yet he published a false statement of apparent self-dealing by NantWorks by stating a fabricated amount of $6M.
The written statement the reporter sent to Dr. Soon-Shiong in his interview before the story published demonstrated this fact. He wrote: “According to our review of your form 990s, the NantHealth Foundation sold nearly $15.5 million in assets to NantWorks, LLC,” which clearly demonstrates that he knew he was publishing a false number. Thus, the reporter was well aware and understood the false and defamatory implication of what he wrote.
The reporter’s assertion that NantWorks paid $6M is also belied as can be seen in the foundations publicly viewable tax returns. The foundation sold the 9920 Jefferson property in May, 2012 to NantWorks for $15,450,000. The price was based on two appraisals, which came in within 99% of each other, by unaffiliated and well-regarded real estate appraisal firms. Upon advice of counsel, the disinterested foundation directors decided to sell the real estate to NantWorks, at the median price between the two appraisals. Dr. Soon-Shiong did not participate in the directors’ decision. Rather, he disclosed his conflict to the foundation’s board and recused himself from the meeting before the vote.
We demanded a retraction and correction but so far, the editors declined.

Acquisition Price Represents Significant Premium to Recent Equity Financings 
CULVER CITY, CA, USA I June 27, 2017 I NantCell, Inc., a member of the ecosystem of NantWorks companies, today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Altor BioScience Corporation. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Altor BioScience capital stock will be converted into the right to receive an upfront payment of $2.00 (payable in cash and/or NantCell common stock at the election of each Altor BioScience stockholder). The upfront payment alone represents over a 20 percent premium to Altor BioScience’s most recent equity financing completed in March 2017 and a 33 percent premium to equity financings in 2016. Each share will also receive two Contingent Value Rights (CVR), which entitle its holder to receive payments of up to an additional $4.00 per share (payable in cash and/or NantCell common stock at the election of each Altor BioScience stockholder) upon achievement of a regulatory milestone and a sales milestone.
The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, including the independent directors of Altor BioScience, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the acquisition by shareholders of Altor BioScience. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.
About NantCell
NantCell, an entity controlled by Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, is an immuno-oncology company focused on the discovery of innovative antibody, T cell and NK cell based treatments by developing molecularly targeted therapeutics, based on the proteomic profile of the patient's tumor, independent of the cancer's anatomical type.
NantCell's mission is to make obsolete the standard method of clinical trial design of "trial and error" and replace it with a level of quantitative predictability based on both the genomic and proteomic profile performed a priori. The Company will tap into comprehensive “omic” analytic tools and "big data" generated from supercomputing to develop molecularly designed drugs in this era of genomics and proteomics and identify patients and their tumor signature at the most granular cellular, DNA and protein levels. Patients entering clinical trials would be identified after a comprehensive “omic” analysis from tissue to cell to DNA to RNA to protein to peptide to drug, and tested based on this molecular profile to maximize clinical outcome and minimize side effects. Through these integrated diagnostic methods, the company is pursuing the vision of treating the biology of cancer rather than the anatomy, and drive the immune system inherited by all to defeat cancer. For more information please visit www.nanthealth.com and follow Dr. Soon-Shiong on Twitter @Dr.PatSoonShiong.
About NantWorks
NantWorks, LLC, is the umbrella organization for an ecosystem of companies committed to the convergence of 21st century innovative platforms to transform how we work, live and play: NantHealth, NantOmics, NantBioScience, NantCell and its affiliate NantKwest, NantPharma, NantMobile, NantStudio, NantCapital and NantCloud. Fact-based and solution-driven, each of NantWorks’ division companies operates at the intersection of innovation and infrastructure.

NantKwest And NantCell Announce FDA Authorization For The NANT Cancer Vaccine Clinical Trials, The First Novel Combination Of Innate And Adaptive Immunotherapy In Patients With Pancreatic Cancer






Business Wire




May 9, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 


















































  NantCell and NantKwest Inc. (NASDAQ:NK), two pioneering, next generation, clinical-stage immunotherapy companies focused on harnessing the unique power of our immune system using natural killer (NK) cells to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for the NANT Cancer Vaccine for clinical trial enrollment for pancreatic cancer patients ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03136406 ).  The NANT Cancer Vaccine is the first combination immunotherapy protocol to orchestrate the delivery of metronomic low-dose radiation and chemotherapy with molecularly-informed, tumor-associated antigen vaccines and natural killer cells, to activate the innate and adaptive immune system and to induce immunogenic cell death. By inducing immunogenic cell death and protecting as well as enhancing the innate and adaptive immune system, the NANT Cancer Vaccine seeks to attain long-term sustainable remission of multiple tumor types with lower toxicity and higher efficacy than current standards of care.  "Abraxane, a nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab) paclitaxel, was the first protein-based drug to alter the survival of metastatic pancreatic cancer in over 20 years," noted Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, Chairman and CEO of NantKwest. "But we were not content just with the approval of Abraxane as being sufficient to transform this disease. In January 2016, we announced our Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 journey towards developing effective personalized cancer treatments to further harness the human body's innate immune system as a paradigm change to treating patients with cancer. Today's FDA clearance is a further step in our 25-year quest to develop this cancer vaccine that seeks to induce immunogenic cell death and orchestrate the innate and adaptive immune system of the patient through the delivery of molecularly informed, biological platforms. To our knowledge this is the first clinical study whereby protein nanoparticles (Nab) delivering low dose metronomic chemotherapy is combined with molecularly informed (GPS Cancer) tumor associated antigens activating dendritic and T cells by adenoviral and yeast vectors, and orchestrated with both endogenous (IL-15) and exogenous (off the shelf) activation of NK cells. This NANT Cancer Vaccine will be studied in patients suffering from all types of cancers and at all stages of disease in the coming 12 months, a Cancer Breakthroughs 2020 goal," Dr. Soon-Shiong added.

NantCell Announces FDA Grant of Orphan Drug Designation for the Company’s Ganitumab Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Ewing Sarcoma
Apr 10 17
NantCell, Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to the company's Ganitumab, Insulin Growth Factor-1R (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of patients with Ewing sarcoma. Ganitumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R that is being investigated in a Phase III human clinical trial titled Combination Chemotherapy with or without Ganitumab in Treating Patients with Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma  (NCT02306161) by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in partnership with Children's Oncology Group (COG) and NantCell at clinical sites across the United States and Canada. IGF-1R plays a role in the development and progression of many cancers, possibly due to its anti-apoptotic properties, which allow cancerous cells to resist the cytotoxic properties of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation therapy. Ganitumab inhibits cancer cell proliferation through disruption of the P13K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Signaling through IGF-1R plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and survival, and has been shown to be a critical promoter of anchorage independent growth, a well-recognized mechanism for malignancy.

What You Need to Know About NantCell

12/1/2015 3:23:18 PM




December 1, 2015

By Mark Terry, BioSpace.com Breaking News Staff

NantCell is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NantWorks, LLC. NantWorks was founded by Patrick Soon-Shiong, inventor of the first human nanoparticle chemotherapeutic agent, Abraxane. 

NantWorks is the umbrella company for a number of companies, including NantHealth, NantMobile, NantMedia, NantOmics, NantBioscience, NantCell, NantPharma, NantCapital and NantCloud. NantWorks focuses on developing a range of technologies that will accelerate innovation, assist new research, and improvement healthcare treatments.

NantCell is an immune-oncology company that is working to discover innovative antibody, T cell and NK cell-based treatments by developing molecular-targeted therapeutics based on the patient’s tumor proteome profile, separate from the cancer’s anatomical type. The company hopes to develop a pipeline of human antibodies and protein inhibitors that drive tumor growth. It also hopes to identify Chimeric Receptor Antigen platforms in both T and NK cells.

The particular focus is to assist in clinical trials. The company has said, “its missions is to make obsolete the standard method of clinical trial design of ‘trial and error’ and replace it with a level of quantitative predictability based on both the genomic and proteomic profile performed a priori. The company will tap into comprehensive ‘omic’ analytic tools and ‘big data’ generated from supercomputing to develop molecularly designed drugs in this era of genomics and proteomics and identify patients and their tumor signature at the most granular cellular, DNA and protein levels.”

Company Leadership

Patrick Soon-Shiong—founder and chief executive officer. Soon-Shiong is the creator of Abraxane and the founder of the nab technology platform used to develop humanized antibodies and inhibitors of tumor proteins. An entrepreneur, former surgeon and professor at University of California at Los Angeles, Soon-Shiong founded APP Pharmaceuticals in 1997, which he sold to Fresenius SE for $3.7 billion in July 2008. He then founded Abraxis 
BioScience, manufacturer of Abraxane, the drug he invented. Abraxane (paclitaxel) is an injectable formula used to treat breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, as well as a variety of other cancer types. In 2010, Soon-Shiong sold Abraxis to Celgene (CELG) in a deal valued at over $3 billion.

He has since gone on to form a number of companies under the NantWorks umbrella. NantWorks has a stated mission “to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secured advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live.”

Charles Kim—NantCell’s general counsel.

Company Financing

Soon-Shiong is notoriously close-mouthed about the companies he runs. What is known about NantCell is that in September it raised $100 million in equity funding from unnamed investors. This followed a $75 million round in June, quite possibly from the same undisclosed investor. It is possible, although completely unconfirmed, that the investor is Soon-Shiong.

Pipeline

In January, the company acquired AMG 479 (ganitumab) from Amgen (AMGN). AMG 479 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), a potential target for cancer therapy. The drug was previously investigated by Amgen for pancreatic testing, but was halted in 2012 after early results showed little. In a statement at the time of the acquisition, Soon-Shiong said, “It is our belief that the future of cancer care will involve combination therapy with low dose, metronomic use of multiple chemotherapeutic agents, but combined also with immuno-oncology molecules, or with engineered killer cells targeted at the proteomic profile of the specific tumor, regardless of the anatomical type.”

Market Competition

It’s generally hard to get a grip on exactly what NantCell and Soon-Shiong is doing, although it appears to fit into the hot area of immuno-oncology. The company also appears to be focused on utilizing big data and proteomics to identify broad cancer markers. Competitors include Juno 
Therapeutics (JUNO) and CytomX Therapeutics. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is currently marketing Opdivo, a checkpoint inhibitor of PD-1, and Merck (MRK) markets Keytruda, also a checkpoint inhibitor of PD-1. Bristol-Myers Squibb also offers Yervoy, a checkpoint inhibitor of CTLA-4.

Dollars and Deals

When NantCell launched in January 2015, it simultaneously announced it had entered into an agreement with Amgen (AMGN) for AMG 479 (ganitumab), which was previously in Phase III development. Under that deal, NantCell acquired the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the compound worldwide, excluding Japan. AMG 479 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets Type 1 IGF-1R, a potential target for cancer therapy.

In March 2015, the company traded about $110 million in cash and equity for the rights to unspecified immunotherapies from Sorrento 
Therapeutics. Although details are far and few between, there was apparently $90 million upfront and the deal could hit $1.3 billion if regulatory and sales milestones are met. Part of the deal involved the acquisition of an Abraxane-like chemotherapy drug, Igdrasol. Sorrento originally had plans to file the drug with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2016. Developed by South Korea-based Samyang Biopharmaceuticals for metastatic breast cancer, the drug has been studied in Phase III trials in the U.S. for pancreatic, ovarian and bladder cancers.

In June 2015, NantCell announced that VBC Holdings, LLC, one of the NantWorks subsidiaries, acquired Italian company VivaBioCell SpA. “With the acquisition of VivaBioCell, we have added novel and complementary cell culture capabilities and extended our geographic footprint,” Soon-Shiong said in a statement. “For nearly a decade, the team at VivaBioCell has been focused on discovering and developing therapies that utilize stem cell and tissue engineering and cell culture capabilities, and enables next generation low cost manufacturing systems in the era of cell-based immunotherapy.”

What to Look For

Not much is known about the company’s approach, but if Soon-Shiong’s history and finances are any indication, the company has deep pockets and an innovative approach with at least two potential products to investigate that have been pretty thoroughly tested for safety.
