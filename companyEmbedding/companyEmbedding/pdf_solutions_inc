About PDF Solutions PDF Solutions enables customers to reduce the time to market of integrated circuits (“ICs”), lower the cost of IC design and manufacturing and improve profitability.

About PDF Solutions PDF Solutions enables customers to reduce the time to market of integrated circuits (“ICs”), lower the cost of IC design and manufacturing and improve profitability. The Company has developed proprietary products and provides services that target the entire Process Life Cycle, which is a term used to mean the time from technology development and the design of an IC to volume manufacturing of that IC to product assembly and test. PDF Solutions’ products and services consist of proprietary test structures and electrical test systems, physical intellectual property, enterprise platform software and professional services. The Company’s Characterization Vehicle® (CV®) electrical test chip infrastructure provides core modeling capabilities, and is used by more leading manufacturers than any other test chips in the industry. The Design-for-Inspection™ (DFI™) solution extends the Company’s electrical characterization technologies into the e-beam measurement of extremely dense test structures, or DFI cells, across an entire fabrication process. Proprietary Template™ layout patterns for standard cell libraries optimize area, performance, and manufacturability for designing IC products. The Exensio platform for big data unlocks relevant, actionable information buried in wafer fabrication, process control and test data through four, key components: Exensio®  -Yield, Exensio®  -Control, Exensio®  -Test, Exensio®  -ALPS, and Exensio®  -Char. The Exensio® platform is available either on-premise or via software as a service (SaaS).

(NASDAQ:PDFS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PDF Solutions: Demand For Software Platform, Innovative Product Pipeline Ensure UpsideJan.26.16 | About: PDF Solutions, (PDFS) Alpha Max Long only, tech, chipmakers, softwareSummaryThe share price of PDF Solutions has fallen more than 50% in 2015.In 2016 the stock could rebound strongly driven by rising demand for its products.I believe this is a long-term investment opportunity although the stock is expected to rise 60% in 2016.PDF Solutions (NASDAQ:PDFS), founded by CEO John Kibarian and Kimon Michaels in 1991, is a solutions provider in the semiconductor industry mainly in the areas of yield management and process control. The company's share price has fallen more than 50% in 2015 due to excess inventory at some of its foundry customers like GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) in 28nm node. However, 2016 should be a good year for the company with foundries shifting silicon production toward smaller nodes like 16nm and 14nm. Further, in the next three to five years PDF should see rising demand for its Exensio big data software platform, as the company adjusted the platform for making it compatible with the upcoming 10nm and 7nm nodes. Business Overview PDF Solutions' core business model involves offering semiconductor companies Design for Manufacturability (DFM) technology. DFM is a unique technology that helps semiconductor players enhance silicon yield. Since yield and profitability are closely tied in the semiconductor industry, the company's solutions help clients increase profits. The company's Exensio software platform offers clients a wide range of solutions. The Exensio platform works by analyzing data collected from the entire ecosystem of the semiconductor industry. PDF's solutions help both fabless chipmakers and foundry operators (see the image below). 

 Image Credit: PDF Solutions Exensio-Yield, part of the platform, provides solutions to the foundries to fine tune their equipment so that higher yields can be achieved. Using Exensio-Yield chipmakers can introduce chips not only at a rapid pace but also at a lower cost. Exensio-Control, which provides advanced process control, helps clients manufacture chips in high volume without sacrificing quality.
 In addition, the Exensio software platform offers CV (characterization vehicle) electrical test chip solutions via Exensio-Test and Exensio-Char. These solutions are most widely used across the semiconductor industry.  PDF's Growth Opportunities PDF generates revenues from two sources. First, it earns fee-based income by designing silicon yield solutions for fabless and foundry clients. The company calls it design-to-silicon-yield solutions revenue, or simply solutions revenue. Second, it earns "gainshare" performance incentives by helping clients achieve yield targets, which the company calls gainshare revenue. Since gainshare revenue is directly correlated to volumes of wafer production shipped by its clients, it is highly volatile. In 2015, gainshare revenue growth remained below average levels due to a meaningful decline in volumes in the 28nm node. Chipmakers had record inventories in this node. The 28nm production will peak 2018, and by that time the standard foundry process will move toward 7nm. In the meantime, 16nm and 14nm nodes will see volume growth. To take advantage of the situation, PDF management has shifted its focus on smaller nodes. It has started a 10nm ramp in the third quarter of 2015 and signed a number of contracts with Chinese players in the 10nm node. Volume will increase substantially in smaller nodes from this year. As a result, the company's gainshare revenue will grow significantly in the next three to five years. Once 7nm becomes the industry standard, it's expected to be long-lived since it will be the last non-EUV node. EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography), the next-generation lithography technology, will be employed beyond 7nm and in some cases in 7nm. However, EUV is still evolving and hasn't become commercially viable yet. As a result, 7nm based on non-EUV will continue to dominate the industry for a longer period of time. Since PDF has adjusted its platform for smaller nodes, its revenue from silicon yield solutions also will see stable growth in the next three to five years.
 PDF Has Significant Upside From DFI Technology PDF's stock has significant upside from its DFI technology. PDF's new Design for Inspection (DFI) technology helps clients monitor semiconductor processing utilizing the unused space on chips, which has the potential to yield better results compared to optical inspection. PDF has intellectual property for utilizing the unused space for test structures. Currently the company is conducting R&D for making DFI commercially viable. DFI has the potential to create a new revenue stream for the company. However, the stock hasn't yet priced in the company's opportunities in DFI. Valuation In the third quarter of 2015, PDF's design-to-silicon-yield solutions revenue was $17.8 million and gainshare revenue was $6.6 million. Adding the two components, PDF's total revenue for the quarter came in at $24.4 million. Recently Taiwan Semiconductor said the company expects their market share for current 14nm/16nm production would rise to around 70% in 2016 from 40% in 2015. The company also expects to begin 7nm chip production in the first half of 2018 and 5nm chip production in 2020. This is a positive development for PDF. With the industry heading toward smaller nodes, I expect PDF's solutions revenue will rise at a CAGR of high single-digits in the next three to five years, while gainshare revenue is expected to rise at a CAGR in the mid-teens. For full-year 2016, PDF's solutions revenue is expected to be around $77 million (factoring in 8% CAGR growth), while gainshare revenue would be around $31 million (factoring in 16% CAGR growth), making the projected 2016 total revenue $108 million. In the last three years, PDF enjoyed an average EV/revenue multiple of 4x. The multiple expanded to 6.5x in 2014, when industry-wide production volume in the 28nm nodes were at the top level and contracted currently to 1.6x due to a drop in volume in 28nm, coupled with ongoing correction in stocks. However, for valuing PDF I would be comfortable with attaching an EV/revenue multiple in the range of 3x to 4x on its 2016 revenue, taking into account the company's revenue growth potential in DFI, as discussed above.
 Applying an average multiple of 3.5x on the company's 2016 projected revenue of $108 million, its enterprise value arrives at $378 million. The company is debt free. Adding cash reserves of $126 million with the enterprise value, its market cap arrives at $504 million. With 31.43 million shares outstanding, PDF's share price equals $16, based on estimated one-year forward revenue. Currently the stock is trading around $10 and has 60% upside from here. Competitive Landscape PDF faces competition in the semiconductor yield management space from players like KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT), Rudolph Technologies (NYSE:RTEC) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). In the process control space the company faces competition from Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) and MKS Instruments (NASDAQ:MKSI). However, PDF's advantage is that it offers yield management, process control and test chip solutions via a common platform. This helps chipmakers reduce cost and increase efficiency. In addition, when PDF introduces its DFI solutions, chipmakers will get all the solutions under one roof. This will make PDF the most sought-after solution provider in the semiconductor industry. Conclusion I expect that PDF will announce a game-changer product within the next 12 months using its IP and innovative technology in the DFI field. The stock hasn't yet priced in the fact that when DFI will become another revenue stream for the company, PDF's revenue will increase substantially. This will act as a strong catalyst for the stock.

					Full Description



PDF Solutions, Inc., incorporated on July 19, 2000, is a provider of infrastructure technologies and services for integrated circuits (IC). The Company's technologies and services focus on the IC manufacturing process life cycle. It operates in the segment of licensing and implementation of yield improvement solutions for integrated circuit manufacturers. The Company has developed solutions for yield simulation, analysis, loss detection, and improvement. Its characterization vehicle infrastructure (CVi) enables customers to electrically characterize the manufacturing process, and establish fail-rate information needed to calibrate manufacturing yield models and prioritize yield improvement activities. The Company's CVi includes Characterization Vehicle test chips, including designs of experiments and layout designs, and a parallel electrical functional and parametric-test system, which consists of hardware and software designed to provide an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time required to test the Company's Characterization Vehicle test chips.Manufacturing Process SolutionsThe IC manufacturing process typically involves four sequential phases: research and development to establish unit manufacturing processes, such as units for the metal chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) or lithography processes; integration of these unit processes into functional modules, such as metal or contact modules; a yield ramp of products through manufacturing line, and volume manufacturing of all products through life of the process. The Company's process research and development (R&D) solutions are designed for manufacturing processes with respect to layout characteristics within anticipated process design rules. Its process integration and yield ramp solutions are designed to enable its customers to ramp the yield of products early in the manufacturing process by characterizing the process-design interactions within each key process module, simulating product yield loss by process module, and prioritizing quantitative yield improvement by design block in real products.Volume Manufacturing SolutionsThe Company's volume manufacturing solutions are designed to enable its customers to extend its yield ramp services through the life of the process by continuing to collect test data and equipment signals during production and improving yield, while reducing the overhead of manufacturing separate test wafers. Its Exensio YieldAware solution combines software and services to enable customers to collect and combine product test data and equipment signals during production.Design-for-Manufacturability (DFM) SolutionsThe Company's DFM solutions are designed to enable its customers to enhance yields, improve parametric performance, and reduce product ramp time by integrating manufacturability considerations into the design cycle before a design is sent to the mask shop to manufacture IC products. The Company's Logic DFM solutions include software, CVi, and services designed to validate customers' process design kit (PDK) and to maximize functional and parametric yield improvements while achieving requirements for density or performance, for example, in the logic portions of an IC design. Its software helps designers optimize the yield of the logic portion by using process-specific and design style-specific yield models and technology files that enable identification and implementation of IP design building block improvements that result in enhanced yield.The Company's Circuit level DFM solutions include software and services designed to anticipate the effects of process variability during analog/mixed signal/RF circuit design to optimize the manufacturability of each block given a pre-characterized manufacturing process. Its Memory DFM solutions include software and services designed to optimize the memory redundancy and bit cell usage given a pre-characterized manufacturing process. The Company's Template physical Internet protocol (IP) solutions include Library Analyzer software and IP for identifying and developing a set of layout patterns that are optimized to a given manufacturing process, and target product application and second checking proposed product layout designs against this set of patterns for optimal manufacturability.Characterization Vehicle InfrastructureThe Company's test chip design engineers develop a design of experiments (DOEs) to determine how IC design building blocks interact with the manufacturing process. The Company's Characterization Vehicle (CV) software utilizes the DOE, as well as a library of building blocks that yield and performance impact, to generate CV test chip layouts. The Company's CV infrastructure includes CV Test Chips, pdCV Analysis Software and pdFasTest Electrical Wafer Test System. The Company's family of test chip products is run through the manufacturing process with intentional process modifications to explore the effects of potential process improvements given natural manufacturing variations. The Company's CV test chips are optimized for its test hardware and analysis software and include DOEs tuned to each customer's process. Its full-reticle short-flow CV test chips provide a learning cycle for specific process modules and are integrated with third-party failure analysis and inspection tools for complete diagnosis to root cause.The Company's Scribe CV products are inserted directly on customers' product wafers and collect data from product wafers about critical layers. Its CV test chips enable yield learning for product designs by allowing its clients to measure components of actual product layout. The Company's software accumulates data from its CV test chips, enabling models of the performance effects of process variations on these design building blocks to be generated for use with its Yield Ramp Simulator software. The Company's pdFasTest Electrical Wafer Test System enables defect and parametric characterization of manufacturing processes.Yield Ramp Simulator (YRS) SoftwareThe Company's YRS software analyzes an IC design to compute its systematic and random yield loss. YRS software allows design attribute extraction and feature-based yield modeling. YRS software takes as input a layout that is typically in industry standard format and yield models generated by running and testing its CV test chips. YRS software is designed to estimate the yield loss due to optical proximity effects, etch micro-lading, dishing in CMP, and other basic process issues.Template TechnologyThe Company's Template technology includes Library Analyzer software and IP. It is used for the identifying and developing a set of layout patterns that are tailored to a given manufacturing process and target product application and checking proposed designs against this set of patterns for manufacturability.Exensio Enterprise-wide PlatformThe Company's Exensio platform addresses the Big Data Manufacturing Challenge of process nodes and integrated products. These data types include in-line and end-of-line metrology, yield, parametric, performance, manufacturing consumables, tool-level sensor data, as well as custom data types. This enables sensor level, root cause diagnosis of yield and performance issues that impact manufacturing, through building process models of these relationships. The online models then enable predictive and proactive optimization decisions for process control, process adjustments, tool corrective actions, wafer dispatching, and wafer level and final test. The Company's Exensio platform also enables diagnosis and understanding of yield loss and performance-limiting mechanisms identified at both in-line and end-of -line wafer processing, through application of the developed models.The Exensio-Yield Advanced components include extra yield analysis software tools that aid in the diagnosis of complex yield issues. This includes defect analysis tools, spatial signature analysis, and data-mining capabilities. The Exensio Reporting and Automation module enables real-time execution of interactive reports, analyses, and dashboards. These reports can be delivered, and interacted-with, via the full Exensio client, through a browser utilizing an analysis plug-in, as well as on mobile devices with a mobile application.The Company competes with KLA-Tencor, Mentor Graphics, Rudolph Technologies, Inc., Cyberdaemons, YieldWerx, Synopsys, Inc., Qualtera, Applied Materials, Inc., BISTel Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., Trancom Technology, Inc., Hermes Microvision, Inc., Keysight Technologies, Inc., Optimal+, Invantest, Inc., ARM Ltd. and Tela Innovations, Inc.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
