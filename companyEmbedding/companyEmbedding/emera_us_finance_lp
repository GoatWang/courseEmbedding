NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION 
      IN THE UNITED STATES






June 01, 2016 11:32 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HALIFAX, Nova Scotia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Emera Incorporated (“Emera” or the “Company”) (TSX: EMA) announced today 
      that in connection with the proposed offering of unsecured, subordinated 
      notes (the “Hybrid Notes”) of Emera, it has filed a preliminary short 
      form base shelf prospectus (the “Base Shelf”) with the Nova Scotia 
      Securities Commission (the “NSSC”) under the United States / Canada 
      Multijurisdictional Disclosure System and a corresponding shelf 
      registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the United 
      States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on Form F-10.
    

      In addition, Emera announced today that: (i) Emera US Finance LP (the 
      “U.S. Notes Issuer”), a limited partnership wholly-owned directly and 
      indirectly by Emera, intends to issue multiple series of United States 
      dollar denominated senior, unsecured notes (the “U.S. Notes”), fully and 
      unconditionally guaranteed by Emera US Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned 
      subsidiary of Emera (“EUSHI”) and Emera (together with EUSHI, the 
      “Guarantors”), pursuant to an offering memorandum; and (ii) Emera 
      intends to issue one or more series of Canadian dollar denominated 
      senior, unsecured notes (the “Canadian Notes”), and may issue Canadian 
      dollar denominated unsecured, subordinated notes, in each case, on a 
      private placement basis in each of the provinces of Canada pursuant to 
      an offering memorandum.
    

      Emera has filed the Base Shelf and Registration Statement relating to 
      the proposed offering of the Hybrid Notes and is separately undertaking 
      the proposed offerings of the U.S. Notes and the Canadian Notes, and may 
      undertake an offering of Canadian dollar denominated unsecured, 
      subordinated notes, to raise up to approximately Cdn$6.6 billion in the 
      aggregate as part of the financing of the previously announced 
      acquisition of TECO Energy, Inc. (“TECO Energy”) by Emera (the 
      “Acquisition”).
    

Hybrid Notes Offering


      Once a receipt is obtained from the NSSC respecting a final short form 
      base shelf prospectus (the “Final Base Shelf”) and the Registration 
      Statement becomes effective, these filings will provide for the offer 
      and sale in the United States from time to time of Hybrid Notes in one 
      or more transactions, at prices, with maturities and on terms to be set 
      forth in one or more prospectus supplements (each, a “Prospectus 
      Supplement”) to be filed with the NSSC and the SEC at the time of any 
      such offering.
    

      The Base Shelf has been filed with the NSSC but a receipt for the Final 
      Base Shelf Prospectus has not yet been issued and the Registration 
      Statement has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. 
      No Hybrid Notes may be sold, nor may offers to buy the Hybrid Notes be 
      accepted, prior to the time the Final Base Shelf is receipted and the 
      Registration Statement becomes effective. When available, a Prospectus 
      Supplement relating to an offering of Hybrid Notes will be obtainable at www.sedar.com 
      and www.sec.gov 
      and may be obtained from Emera. The Hybrid Notes will not be listed on 
      any securities exchange and Emera does not intend to arrange for the 
      Hybrid Notes to be included on any automated quotation system. The 
      Hybrid Notes are not being offered for sale in Canada and this press 
      release is not an offer of securities for sale in the United States. The 
      Hybrid Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent 
      registration or an exemption from registration. Any public offering of 
      the Hybrid Notes to be made in the United States will be made by means 
      of a prospectus that may be obtained from Emera and that will contain 
      detailed information about the Company and management, as well as 
      financial statements.
    

U.S. Notes Offering


      The U.S. Notes and the related guarantees will be senior unsecured 
      indebtedness of the U.S. Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, 
      ranking equally in right of payment with all existing and future 
      unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness of the U.S. Notes Issuer and each 
      of the Guarantors, including the Canadian Notes, and senior in right of 
      payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the U.S. 
      Notes Issuer and each of the Guarantors, including any Hybrid Notes.
    

      In connection with the offering of U.S. Notes, the U.S. Notes Issuer and 
      each of the Guarantors will enter into a registration rights agreement 
      pursuant to which the U.S. Notes Issuer and each of the Guarantors will 
      agree to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to 
      exchange the U.S. Notes and the related guarantees for registered notes 
      and related guarantees with substantially identical terms as the U.S. 
      Notes and the related guarantees, or, under certain circumstances, to 
      file a shelf registration statement to register the resale of the U.S. 
      Notes and the related guarantees.
    

      The offering of the U.S. Notes and the related guarantees has not been 
      registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended 
      (the “Securities Act”) or any state securities laws and the U.S. Notes 
      and the related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United 
      States absent a registration under the Securities Act or an applicable 
      exemption from registration requirements. The U.S. Notes are being sold 
      only to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the 
      Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S of the 
      Securities Act. The U.S. Notes are not being offered for sale in Canada 
      and this press release is not an offer of securities for sale in the 
      United States. Until such time as the U.S. Notes are registered pursuant 
      to the terms of the registration rights agreement, they will be subject 
      to certain restrictions on resale.
    

      The U.S. Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange, and the 
      U.S. Notes Issuer and the Guarantors do not intend to arrange for the 
      U.S. Notes to be included on any quotation system.
    

Canadian Notes Offering


      The Canadian Notes will be senior unsecured indebtedness of Emera, 
      ranking equally in right of payment with all existing and future 
      unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness of Emera, including the 
      guarantees relating to any U.S. Notes, and senior in right of payment to 
      all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Emera, including 
      any Hybrid Notes.
    

      The Canadian Notes will be offered in reliance upon exemptions from 
      prospectus requirements available under applicable Canadian securities 
      laws. As a consequence, the resale of the Canadian Notes will be 
      restricted in the manner provided by Canadian securities laws. The 
      offering of the Canadian Notes will not be registered under the 
      Securities Act or any state securities laws and the Canadian Notes will 
      not be offered or sold in the United States absent a registration under 
      the Securities Act or an applicable exemption from registration 
      requirements. The Canadian Notes will not be offered for sale in the 
      United States and this press release is not an offer of securities for 
      sale in the United States.
    

      The Canadian Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and 
      Emera does not intend to arrange for the Canadian Notes to be included 
      on any automated quotation system.
    

Use of Proceeds


      Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Emera intends to use the net 
      proceeds from any offering of Hybrid Notes, U.S. Notes and/or Canadian 
      Notes to finance, directly or indirectly, part of the purchase price 
      payable for the Acquisition (including acquisition-related expenses) and 
      to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit facilities established in 
      favour of Emera to fund the purchase price payable for the Acquisition, 
      to the extent any amounts are drawn on such facilities in connection 
      with the Acquisition. If certain of the net proceeds from any offering 
      of Hybrid Notes, U.S. Notes or Canadian Notes are not otherwise required 
      to complete the Acquisition, Emera intends to use such net proceeds for 
      general corporate purposes.
    

      If (i) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the later of 
      December 31, 2016 and the date that is no later than June 30, 2017 if 
      the closing of the Acquisition has been extended by Emera or TECO Energy 
      in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger 
      relating to the Acquisition (the “Acquisition Agreement”) (as such date 
      may be extended, the “special mandatory redemption triggering date”) or 
      (ii) the Acquisition Agreement is terminated at any time prior to the 
      special mandatory redemption triggering date, then Emera will be 
      required to redeem any Hybrid Notes and may be required to redeem the 
      Canadian Notes and the U.S. Notes Issuer will be required to redeem any 
      U.S. Notes.
    

Forward Looking Information


      This news release contains forward-looking information within the 
      meaning of applicable securities laws with respect to, among other 
      things, the Acquisition, the intended use of the net proceeds from the 
      sale of the U.S. Notes, Canadian Notes and any Hybrid Notes and the 
      entering into of a registration rights agreement in connection with the 
      offering of U.S. Notes. By its nature, forward-looking information 
      requires Emera to make assumptions and is subject to inherent risks and 
      uncertainties. These statements reflect the current beliefs of the 
      management teams of Emera and are based on information currently 
      available to Emera. There is a risk that predictions, forecasts, 
      conclusions and projections that constitute forward-looking information 
      will not prove to be accurate, that the assumptions of Emera may not be 
      correct and that actual results may differ materially from such 
      forward-looking information. Additional detailed information about these 
      assumptions, risks and uncertainties with respect to Emera is included 
      in Emera's securities regulatory filings, including under the heading 
      "Business Risks and Risk Management" in Emera's annual Management's 
      Discussion and Analysis, and under the heading "Principal Risks and 
      Uncertainties" in the notes to Emera's annual and interim financial 
      statements. The securities regulatory filings of Emera can be found on 
      SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
      Except as required by law, Emera disclaims any intention or obligation 
      to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
      of new information, future events or otherwise.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
