FAIRFAX, Va., July 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --  Next Generation Management Corp. (OTCQB:NGMC) announced today the opening of its flagship medical marijuana dispensary in Hollywood, California. 
"We are pleased to achieve this important milestone in our Company's growth," said Darryl Reed, CEO of NGMC.   "As more states relax laws regarding the sale of medical marijuana our turn key DMS (Dispensary Management Service) will be an important resource for new dispensary owners."
NGMC provides dispensary management services to the medical marijuana industry  including site location selection, dispensary build out, staffing, staff and manager training, security services, and financial advice.  Additionally, NGMC offers as part of its DMS package a comprehensive suite of industry specific software that offers seed to sale controls and regulatory agency compliance featuring the BiotrackTHC application suite.  
"Our goal is to achieve more than 200 patients a day within the next 60 days by advertising on popular medical marijuana sites and by providing the highest quality products," Mr. Reed said.
"We are actively searching for our next location in Southern California," NGMC's CEO concluded.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
