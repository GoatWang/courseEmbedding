LivePerson transforms customer care from voice calls to mobile messaging
We are the only company to do this at scale for the world's largest brands
See how T-Mobile did it












• SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT •
LivePerson, IBM Watson announce new offering to transform customer care











Our cloud-based software platform, LiveEngage, allows brands with millions of customers and tens of thousands of care agents to deliver digital at scale
















































See our customer case studies








The Digital Transformation Playbook
LivePerson has a complete software and operational blueprint to shift from voice to digital





Digital Connections
Give consumers a continuous connection to your brand from their smartphone. Allow them to message you like they message their friends and family—on their own time and terms. LivePerson enables messaging from your app, website, Facebook, Google, SMS, and other applications.



Digital Operations
With the connection digital, first contact resolution improves, and the demand curve for care flattens. Costs are reduced up to 48%, and staff can be structured in “Neighborhoods”—a framework that gives consumers the best agent for their individual needs, not just the next available agent.



Real-Time Measurements
Understand sentiment for 100% of consumer interactions in real time, not after the fact with surveys for a fraction of interactions. LivePerson's proprietary Meaningful Connection Score™ (MCS) delivers this, so agents and managers can take action and improve relationships.



AI and Bots
Agents can work side by side with bots in the same conversation window. Bots do the heavy lifting for repetitive processes, while humans take care of the rest.  The role of bots, and their cost savings, are expanded over time via machine learning.

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

LivePerson transforms customer care from voice calls to mobile messaging
We are the only company to do this at scale for the world's largest brands
See how T-Mobile did it












• SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT •
LivePerson, IBM Watson announce new offering to transform customer care











Our cloud-based software platform, LiveEngage, allows brands with millions of customers and tens of thousands of care agents to deliver digital at scale
















































See our customer case studies








The Digital Transformation Playbook
LivePerson has a complete software and operational blueprint to shift from voice to digital





Digital Connections
Give consumers a continuous connection to your brand from their smartphone. Allow them to message you like they message their friends and family—on their own time and terms. LivePerson enables messaging from your app, website, Facebook, Google, SMS, and other applications.



Digital Operations
With the connection digital, first contact resolution improves, and the demand curve for care flattens. Costs are reduced up to 48%, and staff can be structured in “Neighborhoods”—a framework that gives consumers the best agent for their individual needs, not just the next available agent.



Real-Time Measurements
Understand sentiment for 100% of consumer interactions in real time, not after the fact with surveys for a fraction of interactions. LivePerson's proprietary Meaningful Connection Score™ (MCS) delivers this, so agents and managers can take action and improve relationships.



AI and Bots
Agents can work side by side with bots in the same conversation window. Bots do the heavy lifting for repetitive processes, while humans take care of the rest.  The role of bots, and their cost savings, are expanded over time via machine learning.

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. YAY! Anita your company rocks!liveperson.com

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!

Liveperson ROCKS! This is an old address though... they only have satellite offices in SF.

Have you ever ordered something online and had tons of questions about shipping or the ordering process?

Many companies with online sales use liveperson - it is a Chat for customer service and it makes life soooo easy. 

My friend had liveperson with Land's End and the ordering was so easy. Recently I  ordered a huge, expensive TV on Overstock.com the order and my questions were all made on liveperson = so easy AND I could do other things at work! Today, I couldn't figure out the shipping of my TV and why no tracking number was popping up so I went to overstock hit CHAT LIVE and liveperson opened. Javon helped me and in 2 minutes I had all the info I needed. 

YAY! Anita your company rocks!
