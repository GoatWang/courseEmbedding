Frequently Asked Questions









        Is web hosting necessary for a website?
      




Yes - you need three things to have a functioning website: a domain name, web hosting, and site files. You can think of your domain as your street address, your web host as the space you rent to have your business in, and your site files as the items in your office. Your web host provides the server where your site files (including blog posts, images, landing pages, and more) live so they can be accessed at yourdomain.com.









        How does shared web hosting work?
      




The "shared" in shared hosting refers to the fact that multiple websites are sharing a single web server. Shared is a perfect option for new bloggers or small websites that are just getting started online who need an economical option. As your site traffic grows, you can seamlessly upgrade at any time to a different hosting plan such as cloud hosting.









        How do I choose the right shared hosting plan?
      




The Baby Plan is our most popular shared hosting plan, as it's budget-friendly but allows you to host as many domains as you like. The Business Plan also includes a private SSL (required for e-commerce) and a dedicated IP, making it a great fit for online stores. Regardless of which plan you choose, all of our shared hosting plans come with unlimited emails, easy one-click installs of WordPress and other popular content platforms, and 24/7/365 expert support.









        Can I transfer my web hosting to HostGator?
      




Definitely. HostGator offers FREE site transfers for new accounts within 30 days of signup. We're committed to making web hosting easy and stress-free!

History[edit]
HostGator was founded in October 2002[5] by Brent Oxley, who was then a student at Florida Atlantic University.[6] By 2006, HostGator had passed the 200,000 mark in registered domains.[7]
In 2007, the company moved from the original office in Boca Raton, Florida to a new 20,000 square building in Houston, Texas.[8]
In 2008, Inc. Magazine ranked HostGator in its list of fastest growing companies at 21 in the United States and 1 in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas area[9] The same year, HostGator decided to make their hosting service green hosting by working with Integrated Ecosystem Market Services.[10] In 2008, HostGator prepared for competition companies touting themselves as providing "unlimited" hosting services. Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to back up an "unlimited" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing. He suggested that this move increased sales by at least 30%.
In 2010 an office was added in Austin, Texas[8] In 2011, HostGator started operations in India with a its office in Nashik, Maharashtra and a data centre.
On 21 June 2012, CEO and founder Brent Oxley announced the sale of HostGator to Endurance International Group, advised employees and users not to worry in part because Oxley would still own the buildings HostGator used. He said he wanted to travel the world before he had children. He was also candid about the failures in creating stable billing and register portions of HostGator, and hoped that Endurance might fix those.[11] HostGator was sold to Endurance International Group for $225 million. .
As of 2013, HostGator hosts over 9 million domains and has over 400,000 customers.[12]
Incidents[edit]
2012 social engineering attack[edit]
Further information: UGNazi § WHMCS_leak
In May 2012, the computer hacker group UGNazi claimed responsibility for hacking the web server of the web host billing software developer WHMCS in an apparent social engineering attack involving HostGator.[13][14] A member of the group Cosmo called WHMCS's hosting provider impersonating a senior employee.[15] They were subsequently granted root access to WHMCS's web server after providing information for identity verification. UGNazi later leaked publicly WHMCS's SQL database containing user information and 500,000 customer credit cards,[15] website files, and cPanel configuration.[16] After this issue WHMCS emailed members to change their passwords.
2013 service outages[edit]
Since its acquisition by Endurance International, Hostgator has suffered an increased incidence of server outages and downtime. Notably, on August 2, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Endurance International Group’s data center in Provo, Utah, experienced network outages that affected thousands of customers of Bluehost,[17] HostGator,[18] HostMonster and JustHost.[19][20][21][22]
Spring 2014 blackouts[edit]
During the afternoon of April 16, 2014, the data center in Provo, Utah experienced a networking issue that affected customers of HostGator,[23] HostMonster & Bluehost.[24] The issue was fully rectified only after 24 hours on April 17, 2014 11.35 AM.[25] There was another outage on May 19, 2014 that took nearly 9 hours to completely resolve.[26] This problem occurred in the same data center.[27]
October 2014 outage[edit]
During the morning of October 29, 2014 Hostgator suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.)[28] The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began.[29] On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.[30]
December 2016 outage[edit]
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, Hostgator experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".[31]

History[edit]
HostGator was founded in October 2002[5] by Brent Oxley, who was then a student at Florida Atlantic University.[6] By 2006, HostGator had passed the 200,000 mark in registered domains.[7]
In 2007, the company moved from the original office in Boca Raton, Florida to a new 20,000 square building in Houston, Texas.[8]
In 2008, Inc. Magazine ranked HostGator in its list of fastest growing companies at 21 in the United States and 1 in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas area[9] The same year, HostGator decided to make their hosting service green hosting by working with Integrated Ecosystem Market Services.[10] In 2008, HostGator prepared for competition companies touting themselves as providing "unlimited" hosting services. Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to back up an "unlimited" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing. He suggested that this move increased sales by at least 30%.
In 2010 an office was added in Austin, Texas[8] In 2011, HostGator started operations in India with a its office in Nashik, Maharashtra and a data centre.
On 21 June 2012, CEO and founder Brent Oxley announced the sale of HostGator to Endurance International Group, advised employees and users not to worry in part because Oxley would still own the buildings HostGator used. He said he wanted to travel the world before he had children. He was also candid about the failures in creating stable billing and register portions of HostGator, and hoped that Endurance might fix those.[11] HostGator was sold to Endurance International Group for $225 million. .
As of 2013, HostGator hosts over 9 million domains and has over 400,000 customers.[12]
Incidents[edit]
2012 social engineering attack[edit]
Further information: UGNazi § WHMCS_leak
In May 2012, the computer hacker group UGNazi claimed responsibility for hacking the web server of the web host billing software developer WHMCS in an apparent social engineering attack involving HostGator.[13][14] A member of the group Cosmo called WHMCS's hosting provider impersonating a senior employee.[15] They were subsequently granted root access to WHMCS's web server after providing information for identity verification. UGNazi later leaked publicly WHMCS's SQL database containing user information and 500,000 customer credit cards,[15] website files, and cPanel configuration.[16] After this issue WHMCS emailed members to change their passwords.
2013 service outages[edit]
Since its acquisition by Endurance International, Hostgator has suffered an increased incidence of server outages and downtime. Notably, on August 2, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Endurance International Group’s data center in Provo, Utah, experienced network outages that affected thousands of customers of Bluehost,[17] HostGator,[18] HostMonster and JustHost.[19][20][21][22]
Spring 2014 blackouts[edit]
During the afternoon of April 16, 2014, the data center in Provo, Utah experienced a networking issue that affected customers of HostGator,[23] HostMonster & Bluehost.[24] The issue was fully rectified only after 24 hours on April 17, 2014 11.35 AM.[25] There was another outage on May 19, 2014 that took nearly 9 hours to completely resolve.[26] This problem occurred in the same data center.[27]
October 2014 outage[edit]
During the morning of October 29, 2014 Hostgator suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.)[28] The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began.[29] On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.[30]
December 2016 outage[edit]
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, Hostgator experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".[31]

October 2014 outage[edit]
During the morning of October 29, 2014 Hostgator suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.)[28] The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began.[29] On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.[30]
December 2016 outage[edit]
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, Hostgator experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".[31]

History[edit]
HostGator was founded in October 2002[5] by Brent Oxley, who was then a student at Florida Atlantic University.[6] By 2006, HostGator had passed the 200,000 mark in registered domains.[7]
In 2007, the company moved from the original office in Boca Raton, Florida to a new 20,000 square building in Houston, Texas.[8]
In 2008, Inc. Magazine ranked HostGator in its list of fastest growing companies at 21 in the United States and 1 in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas area[9] The same year, HostGator decided to make their hosting service green hosting by working with Integrated Ecosystem Market Services.[10] In 2008, HostGator prepared for competition companies touting themselves as providing "unlimited" hosting services. Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to back up an "unlimited" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing. He suggested that this move increased sales by at least 30%.
In 2010 an office was added in Austin, Texas[8] In 2011, HostGator started operations in India with a its office in Nashik, Maharashtra and a data centre.
On 21 June 2012, CEO and founder Brent Oxley announced the sale of HostGator to Endurance International Group, advised employees and users not to worry in part because Oxley would still own the buildings HostGator used. He said he wanted to travel the world before he had children. He was also candid about the failures in creating stable billing and register portions of HostGator, and hoped that Endurance might fix those.[11] HostGator was sold to Endurance International Group for $225 million. .
As of 2013, HostGator hosts over 9 million domains and has over 400,000 customers.[12]
Incidents[edit]
2012 social engineering attack[edit]
Further information: UGNazi § WHMCS_leak
In May 2012, the computer hacker group UGNazi claimed responsibility for hacking the web server of the web host billing software developer WHMCS in an apparent social engineering attack involving HostGator.[13][14] A member of the group Cosmo called WHMCS's hosting provider impersonating a senior employee.[15] They were subsequently granted root access to WHMCS's web server after providing information for identity verification. UGNazi later leaked publicly WHMCS's SQL database containing user information and 500,000 customer credit cards,[15] website files, and cPanel configuration.[16] After this issue WHMCS emailed members to change their passwords.
2013 service outages[edit]
Since its acquisition by Endurance International, Hostgator has suffered an increased incidence of server outages and downtime. Notably, on August 2, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Endurance International Group’s data center in Provo, Utah, experienced network outages that affected thousands of customers of Bluehost,[17] HostGator,[18] HostMonster and JustHost.[19][20][21][22]
Spring 2014 blackouts[edit]
During the afternoon of April 16, 2014, the data center in Provo, Utah experienced a networking issue that affected customers of HostGator,[23] HostMonster & Bluehost.[24] The issue was fully rectified only after 24 hours on April 17, 2014 11.35 AM.[25] There was another outage on May 19, 2014 that took nearly 9 hours to completely resolve.[26] This problem occurred in the same data center.[27]
October 2014 outage[edit]
During the morning of October 29, 2014 Hostgator suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.)[28] The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began.[29] On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.[30]
December 2016 outage[edit]
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, Hostgator experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".[31]

HostGator Launches Upgraded Dedicated Server Platform
Jul 24 17
HostGator announced the launch of its line of dedicated servers, which are more than four times faster than before, giving customers the ability to handle significantly more traffic to their website. The upgraded dedicated server platform includes SSD storage and has double both the processing power and the memory available on HostGator's current platform. This latest enhancement to HostGator's offerings is in line with the company's long-term strategy of innovation in the web services space and providing its customers with industry leading products, services and customer support. With new SSD drives and an Intel Xeon-D 1541 processor, the new servers are over four times faster than the current platform. In addition to the enhanced performance gains, customers now have access to free SSLs through their easy to use cPanel or Plesk Control Panel to help ensure the security of their data. As an added bonus, the servers are housed in a Tier 3 data center, which includes fully redundant power, network and cooling components as well as DDOS protection. HostGator's latest Dedicated Server Lineup allows customers who have a significant online presence the flexibility, control and ability to sustain high traffic sites without performance impact. As with all of its products, HostGator's 24/7/365 support team is available to assist customers.

Frequently Asked Questions





Is my domain name available?





There's only one way to know! Simply enter your desired domain name in the search box above and click the Search button to find out if you can register it and for how much. Our domain name search tool will also let you know if other extensions or variations are available, such as yourwebsite.net or yourawesomewebsite.org.








How should I choose a domain name?





Try to keep your name short (less than three words) and easy to remember. If possible, register a domain that's the same as your business name, or incorporate relevant keywords for SEO. You can use letters, numbers, and hyphens in your domain name, but no other special characters. 








Is Domain Name Privacy Protection worth it?





The personal contact information for all domain owners is available online in the public WHOIS directory. Keep your identity private by opting in to HostGator Domain Privacy Protection. We hide your personal contact information from public view by replacing it with ours, protecting you from spam and identity theft.








Why do I need a domain name?





The first step to starting your website is registering your domain name. Think of your domain name as a street address for your website. Without a domain name, you would have to tell customers to visit your website at a temporary url such as 123.123.123.123/~yourwebsite instead of yourwebsite.com. Get your own domain name to lend your site a professional look and establish your online brand!








Which domain name extensions are available?





HostGator sells the following top-level domain (TLD) extensions: .com, .club, .co, .space, .us, .website, .org, .net, .me, .biz, .info, .host, .online, .site, and .tech. If you're looking for something a bit more exotic like .ninja or .beer, we partner with Domain.com to sell the latest new extensions.

History[edit]
HostGator was founded in October 2002[5] by Brent Oxley, who was then a student at Florida Atlantic University.[6] By 2006, HostGator had passed the 200,000 mark in registered domains.[7]
In 2007, the company moved from the original office in Boca Raton, Florida to a new 20,000 square building in Houston, Texas.[8]
In 2008, Inc. Magazine ranked HostGator in its list of fastest growing companies at 21 in the United States and 1 in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, Texas area[9] The same year, HostGator decided to make their hosting service green hosting by working with Integrated Ecosystem Market Services.[10] In 2008, HostGator prepared for competition companies touting themselves as providing "unlimited" hosting services. Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to back up an "unlimited" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing. He suggested that this move increased sales by at least 30%.
In 2010 an office was added in Austin, Texas[8] In 2011, HostGator started operations in India with a its office in Nashik, Maharashtra and a data centre.
On 21 June 2012, CEO and founder Brent Oxley announced the sale of HostGator to Endurance International Group, advised employees and users not to worry in part because Oxley would still own the buildings HostGator used. He said he wanted to travel the world before he had children. He was also candid about the failures in creating stable billing and register portions of HostGator, and hoped that Endurance might fix those.[11] HostGator was sold to Endurance International Group for $225 million. .
As of 2013, HostGator hosts over 9 million domains and has over 400,000 customers.[12]

In May 2012, the computer hacker group UGNazi claimed responsibility for hacking the web server of the web host billing software developer WHMCS in an apparent social engineering attack involving HostGator.[13][14] A member of the group Cosmo called WHMCS's hosting provider impersonating a senior employee.[15] They were subsequently granted root access to WHMCS's web server after providing information for identity verification. UGNazi later leaked publicly WHMCS's SQL database containing user information and 500,000 customer credit cards,[15] website files, and cPanel configuration.[16] After this issue WHMCS emailed members to change their passwords.
2013 service outages[edit]
Since its acquisition by Endurance International, Hostgator has suffered an increased incidence of server outages and downtime. Notably, on August 2, 2013 and December 31, 2013, Endurance International Group’s data center in Provo, Utah, experienced network outages that affected thousands of customers of Bluehost,[17] HostGator,[18] HostMonster and JustHost.[19][20][21][22]
Spring 2014 blackouts[edit]
During the afternoon of April 16, 2014, the data center in Provo, Utah experienced a networking issue that affected customers of HostGator,[23] HostMonster & Bluehost.[24] The issue was fully rectified only after 24 hours on April 17, 2014 11.35 AM.[25] There was another outage on May 19, 2014 that took nearly 9 hours to completely resolve.[26] This problem occurred in the same data center.[27]
October 2014 outage[edit]
During the morning of October 29, 2014 Hostgator suffered another major outage that affected their reseller accounts. The company did not immediately announce the cause of the outage, though they stated, on Facebook and their forum, that an OS upgrade was the cause of the issue. (They made the reseller sections of their forum inaccessible to the public, visible only to registered users.)[28] The server-level problems were resolved on November 2, 2014, almost five days after the outage began.[29] On November 4, 2014, users were still reporting widespread account-level database problems.[30]
December 2016 outage[edit]
During the afternoon and evening of December 9, 2016, Hostgator experienced a major outage. In their Twitter account, they said: "We are seeing problems w/ network flapping which could be caused by denial of service or other network issues in our switching fabric. We are methodically isolating the issue while making sure we don't deteriorate the network further. It's a large network and we are working on it in sections. Our best team is working through this at our data center and it is our goal to have this resolved very soon. In other words, we know this is frustrating and we are on it! Again, our sincere apologies for this inconvenience.".[31]

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/01/2008
            

                BBB has determined that HostGator.com, L.L.C. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        HostGator.com, L.L.C. has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 29 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
