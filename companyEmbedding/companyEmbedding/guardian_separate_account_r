Watch these stories and learn how: Guardian whole life, annuities, The Living Balance Sheet®, and the advice of a Financial Representative are helping Alan and Rebecca Tinter feel secure in their upcoming retirement and leave a lasting legacy. Brad Hoffner faced challenges in his life, learned to appreciate the value of taking the long-term view with the support of his Financial Representative, and retained the foundation for a promising future through his whole life policy. Freelancers Union and Guardian are joining forces to help their members pursue their dreams through the protection offered by workplace benefits. Previous Guardian annual reports can be found here: 2013 Annual Report2012 Annual Report2011 Annual Report
