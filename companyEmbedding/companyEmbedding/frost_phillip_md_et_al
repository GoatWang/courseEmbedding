In October 16, 2003, a $33 million gift to the School of Music was announced by the University of Miami. In honor of their bequest, the largest ever given to a university-based music school in the U.S. at the time, the School of Music was officially renamed the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music.[26] In 2003, the Art Museum at Florida International University was officially renamed The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum.[27] On March 26, 2011, it was announced that Frost had donated $35 million towards the construction of the new Miami Science Museum building at Bicentennial Park in Downtown Miami, named the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science.[28] In March 2015, he donated an additional $10 million to support the development of the science museums' planetarium, the Frost Planetarium.[29]

The Frost family supports scholarships for advanced study at the University of Oxford in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. The scholarships are open to Israeli students and students from Florida.[31][32]
A new set of STEM institutes was announced on january 23,2017 by University of Miami President Julio Frenk to be housed under the Frost Institutes name at the 50th annual Miami Winter Symposium held at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Miami, a prestigious event that attracted more than 100 scientists, researchers and doctors from 28 countries. This transformational initiative is made possible thanks to the extraordinary $100 million gift by Dr. Phillip and Patricia Frost announced during Frenk's inauguration last year to support basic and applied sciences and engineering. A portion of the $100 million gift will be used for the construction of an iconic, modern science and engineering building on the University's Coral Gables campus, to be named the Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building. Of the gift, $30 million is designated to the creation of at least 13 chairs in STEM fields, with $3 million set aside for graduate student support. [33]

A new set of STEM institutes was announced on january 23,2017 by University of Miami President Julio Frenk to be housed under the Frost Institutes name at the 50th annual Miami Winter Symposium held at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Miami, a prestigious event that attracted more than 100 scientists, researchers and doctors from 28 countries. This transformational initiative is made possible thanks to the extraordinary $100 million gift by Dr. Phillip and Patricia Frost announced during Frenk's inauguration last year to support basic and applied sciences and engineering. A portion of the $100 million gift will be used for the construction of an iconic, modern science and engineering building on the University's Coral Gables campus, to be named the Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
