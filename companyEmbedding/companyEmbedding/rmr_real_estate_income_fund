Governance






RIF is governed by a board of five (5) trustees. The Board of Trustees has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating Committee. Trustees who are independent of the Fund's Advisor serve on each of these Board Committees.  Each Committee carries out specific responsibilities that are described in its charter. You may view the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, or the Nominating Committee by clicking on the applicable link below.
RIF and the Advisor have adopted a Joint Code of Ethics that is based on the principle that the Trustees and officers of the Fund, and the personnel of the Advisor who provide services to the Fund, owe a fiduciary duty to the Fund to conduct their personal securities transactions in a manner that does not interfere with the Fund's transactions or otherwise take unfair advantage of their relationship with the Fund. We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers for the purpose of promoting honest and ethical conduct; full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents and in other public communications made by the Fund; compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and accountability for adherence to the Code. 
We are committed to compliance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, accounting standards, accounting controls, and audit practices. We encourage reporting violations or possible violations to our Audit Committee. We prohibit any retaliatory action for reporting violations or suspected violations in good faith. 
We have also developed a Privacy Policy. 
The following web site page describes how to contact our senior management, our Trustees or our Audit Committee.

Portfolio diversification.
As of March 31, 2017, RIF’s portfolio had approximately $272 million of total investments in 161 common and preferred securities.  No investment represents more than 3.0% of RIF’s total portfolio.






Dividends are a REIT requirement.
REITs are required by U.S. law to pay out 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends.






Industry dividend increases.  
Year to date, as of March 31, 2017, 49 real estate companies in the U.S. increased their common dividend.






Experienced portfolio management.  
Collectively, RIF’s portfolio management team has 50 years of experience in the real estate industry.





RIF dividend increases. 
Since the beginning of 2012, RIF's dividend has been raised six times by a total of 65%. (Past performance is not indicative of future results).






Investment strategy.

At least 90% of RIF’s managed assets must be invested in income producing securities issued by real estate companies; at least 75% of managed assets must be invested in securities issued by REITs; and no more than 10% of managed assets can be invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or traded on a non-U.S. stock exchange.





Investment objective. 
The primary objective of RIF is to earn and pay a high level of current income to shareholders by investing in real estate companies and the Fund’s secondary objective is capital appreciation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
