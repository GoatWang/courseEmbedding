We rely on our mobile devices to stay connected with the ever changing world. We developed the 5BARz products so we can stay close to the people we care for, share the things we love and keep business at hand.


Profile
Company Profile

5BARz International Inc. incorporates multiple patented technologies into a single plug ’n play box that strengthens weak cellular signals on all cellular connected devices. The explosion in data consumption on mobile devices has grown faster than the carriers can build out their networks and as a result the quality of connectivity continues to decline. The single-piece 5BARz unit delivers high quality signals for voice, data, video and everything else on your handset, tablet or other connected device.
With more than 3% of all mobile subscribers globally already leaving their current mobile carrier specifically because of poor signal quality, dropped calls and slow data, we saw a massive opportunity to address unreliable connectivity with innovative thinking and technology. 
 If we were able to solve the weak signal problem for mobile subscribers then they would surely have a better mobile experience and in turn be more loyal to their current carrier. We figured if we could solve the consumer's quality of service issues then the carriers would benefit by default, and so, that is exactly what we did.
5BARz has developed a critical piece of carrier grade technology that consumers will simply plug into an outlet in their home, office or anywhere else to increase their signal strength by up to 70db. With our groundbreaking technology we have created an entirely new category of carrier infrastructure which empowers carriers to deliver a more reliable cellular signal and provide their consumers with an unparalleled mobile experience.


In a world of weak signals, 5BARz’ team of executives, engineers, technology leaders, visionaries, and go getters decided to move forward with one goal — to make you stronger.

Leadership

We have assembled a team of technical minds, global businessmen, cross-border account managers and go getters with one goal in mind: To deliver consumers the best possible mobile experience on every device.

Daniel is a seasoned entrepreneur who has firmly established himself as a ‘hands-on’ developer of premier and unique technologies. Over the last thirty years he has been well ahead of the technology curve by locating state-of-the-art technology, incubating it, developing it, commercializing it and building a world class team around him to make those technology innovations and advances a reality. Through this process Daniel has mastered the small cap market techniques that have allowed him to raise over $100,000,000 for his various ventures in both domestic and international venues. His development and financing activities over the years have allowed him to build a network of like-minded companies and individuals across the globe from Monaco to Moscow, Vancouver to Bangalore. His success in large part is due to his persistence and focus.

Finnis Conner
Board of Advisors
Finis Conner, for the length of his legendary career has consistently identified and executed winning trends in the lightning fast technology industry. Finnis’ experience in selling, designing and manufacturing hard disk drives played a major role in creating the multi-trillion dollar, global technology market that prior to him was non-existant. Finnis has been the pivotal player in migrating computing from floor towers, desktops, laptop computers and now to your back pocket with smaller an smaller devices, with higher capacity and lower costs.
In 1973, Finnis co-founded Shugart Associates, where they produced and sold 8″ floppy and hard (HDD) disc drives. The company was sold to Xerox Corporation in 1977. Not unlike many of the entrepreneurs associated with 5Barz Finnis’ never ending focus on “new market trends” and “consumer needs” have served both us, the consumer and him, the career entrepreneur, very well.
In 1979, Finnis correctly recognized the trend to smaller computers and conceived the original 5 1/4″, 5MB Winchester disc drive which led to co-founding Seagate Technology. Many computer manufactures at the time didn’t see the need for that much memory but Conner sought out and later sold Steve Job at Apple Computer, 95% of his first years production. Today, Seagate is the largest drive company in the world with a $12 Billion market capitalization, 50,000 employees and shipping over 50,000,000 drives per quarter.
In 1986, Finis saw the eventual migration of computers to even smaller and smaller form factors and developed the 3 1/2″ hard drive. There was little interest at Seagate to develop this small of a drive at the time, so Finnis left Seagate to found Conner Peripherals, which was funded with $35M from Compaq Computer. Hence the 3 ½” Winchester Drive was completed and made available for sale in a rather short period of time
Conner Peripherals was an instant success and became the fastest-growing company in U.S. history with Conner leading the growth of the company to $1.4 billion in sales in only its 4th year and $2.7 billion in its 10th year, when he engineered the sale of the company to his former company and then rival, Seagate.
Finnis is noted for having nurtured and developed top management teams throughout his entire career in multiple disciplines including, sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Under Conner, both Seagate and Conner Peripherals built World Class ISO 9001 high tech manufacturing facilities around the globe, including, California, Singapore, China, Vietnam, Ireland, Scotland and Italy. Over the course of his career, his companies were responsible for creating in excess of 160,000 high quality, high paying technology jobs.
Finnis Conner is a visionary student of market trends, a leader in developing market-dominating companies with unmatched financial performance.

5 Tips On Avoiding Reception Rage.
Keep your hands on the device
Avoid losing physical control. Avoid throwing or destroying the device. Take a deep breath, count to 10.
Know that you’re not alone
From time to time, we all lack signal — everyone has some form of reception rage. Try and commiserate with the strangers around you, because you can’t reach your friends.
Avoid signal limiting areas
Plan ahead. Dense urban areas, houses and buildings, large venues and remote locales are prime locations for a weak or unreliable signal.
Lower your expectations
Take a step back. Keep your texts concise and calls short - forget about attaching pictures, limit message to letters and numbers.
End the problem for good
Demand 5Barz. Stream video. Tag friends. Speak loud and clear.
