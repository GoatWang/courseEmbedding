BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Payroc has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 22 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Payroc has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 22 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

TINLEY PARK, Ill., July 12, 2017 (Business Wire) – Payroc LLC, a leading merchant services and payment processing organization, today announced enhancements to its iTransact® payment gateway and payment facilitator (PayFac) program. Referral partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), digital marketplaces, banks and credit unions servicing small business clients and merchants all benefit from greater payments security, connectivity, flexibility, simplicity and visibility:
- New application programming interface (API) enables developers to connect with little to no effort
- Tokenization safeguards sensitive data during processing and storage, making it useless to hackers
- Secure vault storage allows merchants to remotely store customer payment types on file, substantially reducing Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) scope
- Auto-populating Level II corporate card data during processing optimizes interchange qualification
- White-label logo and color scheme capabilities presents a cohesive brand experience
 
Payroc’s iTransact payment gateway and PayFac program offers integrated payments across multiple payment methods and commerce channels, including credit card, eCheck , ACH, e-commerce, EMV mobility solutions, virtual terminal, recurring billing, invoicing and more to meet the needs of any business regardless of size or type. Payroc additionally offers online application, instant boarding, extensive underwriting and risk management tools and expertise, plus a vast array of consolidated reporting capabilities.
“Providing exceptional technology, solutions and service is Payroc’s top priority,” said James Oberman, chief executive officer for Payroc. “The enhancements we’ve made to our iTransact gateway and PayFac program demonstrate this commitment and will help drive businesses forward for all our customers and partners,” added Oberman.
“These technology enhancements make secure and seamless integrated payment processing a reality,” said Jared Poulson, Payroc’s chief product and technology officer. “This enables our clients have the best of both worlds—they can stay focused on their core businesses while leaving us to worry about payments and the related risks,” added Poulson.
For more information about integrating with Payroc’s iTransact platform and Payfac program, please visit our website. Interested parties may also telephone 844-PAYROC4 or inquire via email.

October 10, 2016 10:12 AM Eastern Daylight Time



TINLEY PARK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Payroc 
      LLC, a leading merchant services and payment processing 
      organization, announced today that it has acquired the assets of payment 
      gateway and merchant account provider The

      of Payroc’s payments business, adding 300 trusted advisor referral 
      partners and 6,000 merchants with more than $1.3 billion in annual 
      processing volume. Payroc additionally gains mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) 
      technology, a proprietary e-commerce gateway, and a proprietary 
      integrated payment facilitator (PayFac) platform that will enhance the 
      delivery of customized vertical market payment solutions for micro, 
      small and medium-sized merchants.

      deliver to referral partners, merchants and employees with our increased

      and payment solutions.”

      referral partners and merchants to the Payroc family,” said Nicholas 
      Oberman, president of Payroc. “With iTransact, Payroc is uniquely 
      positioned to capitalize on opportunities for significant growth.”
    

      “The iTransact team is excited to join forces with Payroc,” said Stephen 
      Hall, chief executive officer of iTransact. “This winning combination 
      will enable us to enhance the value we provide to our trusted advisor 
      referral partners and their merchant clients through more robust 
      solutions and expanded service offerings.”
    

      Joining the Payroc leadership team from iTransact are David Hall, 
      executive vice president referral partners; Jared Poulson, chief product 
      and technology officer; and Colby Poulson, senior vice president

      Hall will serve as advisor consultants. Stephen Hall has been appointed 
      to the Payroc board of managers.
    

      Payroc will preserve and maintain the iTransact brand with its strong 
      and long-standing trusted referral partner and merchant relationships, 
      emphasizing continuity and consistency across all business functions, 
      including sales, service, support and operations.

Save valuable time
“Running payroll for a small business is a headache. For me to have switched over to ADP, it’s saved…hours and hours every week. It could come out to days a month!”
Chris Bredesen 
                Owner, The Rockefeller and Captain Kidds 



Pay employees promptly
“With [another payroll processor], our employees weren’t getting paid on the day that payroll was due. When we moved back to ADP, it was beyond easy. The transition was great. It was flawless.”
Brandon McKennon 
                Co-Founder/Partner, BreezeIT 



Accurate from the start
“As a small business, we operate in 5 or 6 different states…so there are a lot of requirements for filing taxes in each one. ADP does an excellent job of helping us maintain that.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
