Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    GlobeNewswire – 
                                                    9:00 AM ET 07/27/2017
                                                


Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL), the nations leading builder of luxury homes, announced today it has begun to pilot a new tool to allow home buyers to use virtual reality to envision design selections in their homes, and make changes that reflect their preferences.

















                                                    Builder sentiment stumbles to 8-month low on higher lumber costs
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    1:56 PM ET 07/18/2017
                                                


National Association of Home Builders indicates post-election lift has faded. Sentiment among home builders slid in July after a stretch of strong months as rising costs for materials started to pinch. The monthly confidence gauge from the National Association of Home Builders fell two points to a reading of 64. June's reading, initially reported as 67, was revised down one point.

                                                    Homebuilder stocks fall after several downgrades at Barclays

Homebuilder stocks slumped broadly Tuesday, after Barclays downgraded several of them, and reiterated a bearish view on some others, citing concerns that valuations suggest investors may be too optimistic in the face of data pointing to moderating buyer traffic trends. Toll Brothers Inc.' s stock shed 1.6% after analyst Michael Dahl downgraded it to underweight from equal weight, while shares of Lennar Corp. (LEN) fell 1.5%, PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) lost 0.6% and TRI Pointe Group Inc....

The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rallied 1.6%, on track for the biggest one-day rise in four months, with 32 of 35 components gaining ground.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
