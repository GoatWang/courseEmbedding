Our Story



At Penn Capital, we believe that understanding a company’s entire capital structure is the best way to identify investment opportunities with the most value. In fact, we’ve found that managing credit portfolios makes us better equity managers; and vice versa. We select stocks or high yield debt securities with the greatest potential to provide the risk-adjusted returns our clients expect.
Our fully integrated credit and equity research process focuses on non-investment grade companies in the micro- to mid-capitalization range, where we can take advantage of inefficient security pricing. We serve institutional and individual investors with strategies that reflect institutional-quality rigor and insight and stay true to our philosophy.
We are an independent, employee-owned boutique investment management firm based in Philadelphia. We forge our own ideas, we respect hard work, and we are committed to our clients, our staff and our community.
