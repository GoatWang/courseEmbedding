Euroseas, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESEA) is shipping company that was founded about a century ago and became public in 2005. The company is based in Maroussi, Greece.

Profile[edit]
Euroseas operates in the dry cargo, drybulk, and container shipping markets worldwide and is also a provider of seaborne transportation for dry bulk and containerized cargoes. It owns and operates drybulk carriers that transport iron ore, coal, and grains, as well as bauxite, phosphate, and fertilizers. The company also owns and operates container ships and multipurpose vessels that transport dry and refrigerated containerized cargoes, primarily manufactured products and perishables.
Euroseas employs its vessels on spot and period charters, as well as through pool arrangements. The Company has a fleet of 11 vessels, including 4 drybulk carriers, 6 container ships and 1 multipurpose dry cargo vessel, for fleet grand total of 375,060 tons deadweight (DWT) (10,179 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)). Euroseas' 4 drybulk carriers have a total cargo capacity of 212,443 DWT, its 6 container ships have a cargo capacity of 140,049 DWT (9,229 TEU) and its 1 multipurpose vessel has a cargo capacity of 22,568 DWT or 950 TEU.
History[edit]
Euroseas' roots go back four generations, prior to the existence of steam and diesel engines, when the company's ships were propelled by sails. Those days ships were maximum 1000 tons and cost about 3000 pounds sterling to build. According to company records, the first Pittas Family shipowner was Nikolaos F. Pittas. He was born on the island of Chios in Greece in 1837. The first vessel he owned was Ypapanti, a 700-ton wooden, sail vessel that was built in Chios in 1873. He became the captain of the ship and his younger brothers and other relatives and friends joined him as crew. The vessel traded in the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the Captain himself always found its next employment from the destination port. He was at all times the Commercial, Technical and Financial Manager of the vessel. No office ashore existed as communications were so poor that people at the home island in Chios often had no news of their whereabouts for months.[1]
Business was flourishing at the time and soon N. F. Pittas could afford the purchase of more ships. The next ships purchased were the "Sotiras", a 780-ton ship that was bought in 1876 and the barque "Chios" the first 1,000 ton ship which was built in Chios in 1878. A few other ships followed. Some were entrusted initially to brothers of N. F. Pittas and subsequent purchases to his sons.[1]
Key executives[edit]

Dr Anastasios Aslidis — Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer

Euroseas, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESEA) is shipping company that was founded about a century ago and became public in 2005. The company is based in Maroussi, Greece.

Profile[edit]
Euroseas operates in the dry cargo, drybulk, and container shipping markets worldwide and is also a provider of seaborne transportation for dry bulk and containerized cargoes. It owns and operates drybulk carriers that transport iron ore, coal, and grains, as well as bauxite, phosphate, and fertilizers. The company also owns and operates container ships and multipurpose vessels that transport dry and refrigerated containerized cargoes, primarily manufactured products and perishables.
Euroseas employs its vessels on spot and period charters, as well as through pool arrangements. The Company has a fleet of 11 vessels, including 4 drybulk carriers, 6 container ships and 1 multipurpose dry cargo vessel, for fleet grand total of 375,060 tons deadweight (DWT) (10,179 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)). Euroseas' 4 drybulk carriers have a total cargo capacity of 212,443 DWT, its 6 container ships have a cargo capacity of 140,049 DWT (9,229 TEU) and its 1 multipurpose vessel has a cargo capacity of 22,568 DWT or 950 TEU.
History[edit]
Euroseas' roots go back four generations, prior to the existence of steam and diesel engines, when the company's ships were propelled by sails. Those days ships were maximum 1000 tons and cost about 3000 pounds sterling to build. According to company records, the first Pittas Family shipowner was Nikolaos F. Pittas. He was born on the island of Chios in Greece in 1837. The first vessel he owned was Ypapanti, a 700-ton wooden, sail vessel that was built in Chios in 1873. He became the captain of the ship and his younger brothers and other relatives and friends joined him as crew. The vessel traded in the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the Captain himself always found its next employment from the destination port. He was at all times the Commercial, Technical and Financial Manager of the vessel. No office ashore existed as communications were so poor that people at the home island in Chios often had no news of their whereabouts for months.[1]
Business was flourishing at the time and soon N. F. Pittas could afford the purchase of more ships. The next ships purchased were the "Sotiras", a 780-ton ship that was bought in 1876 and the barque "Chios" the first 1,000 ton ship which was built in Chios in 1878. A few other ships followed. Some were entrusted initially to brothers of N. F. Pittas and subsequent purchases to his sons.[1]
Key executives[edit]

Mr Aristides J. Pittas — Chairman, Chief Exec. Officer and Press
Dr Anastasios Aslidis — Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer

Euroseas, Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESEA) is shipping company that was founded about a century ago and became public in 2005. The company is based in Maroussi, Greece.

Profile[edit]
Euroseas operates in the dry cargo, drybulk, and container shipping markets worldwide and is also a provider of seaborne transportation for dry bulk and containerized cargoes. It owns and operates drybulk carriers that transport iron ore, coal, and grains, as well as bauxite, phosphate, and fertilizers. The company also owns and operates container ships and multipurpose vessels that transport dry and refrigerated containerized cargoes, primarily manufactured products and perishables.
Euroseas employs its vessels on spot and period charters, as well as through pool arrangements. The Company has a fleet of 11 vessels, including 4 drybulk carriers, 6 container ships and 1 multipurpose dry cargo vessel, for fleet grand total of 375,060 tons deadweight (DWT) (10,179 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)). Euroseas' 4 drybulk carriers have a total cargo capacity of 212,443 DWT, its 6 container ships have a cargo capacity of 140,049 DWT (9,229 TEU) and its 1 multipurpose vessel has a cargo capacity of 22,568 DWT or 950 TEU.
History[edit]
Euroseas' roots go back four generations, prior to the existence of steam and diesel engines, when the company's ships were propelled by sails. Those days ships were maximum 1000 tons and cost about 3000 pounds sterling to build. According to company records, the first Pittas Family shipowner was Nikolaos F. Pittas. He was born on the island of Chios in Greece in 1837. The first vessel he owned was Ypapanti, a 700-ton wooden, sail vessel that was built in Chios in 1873. He became the captain of the ship and his younger brothers and other relatives and friends joined him as crew. The vessel traded in the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the Captain himself always found its next employment from the destination port. He was at all times the Commercial, Technical and Financial Manager of the vessel. No office ashore existed as communications were so poor that people at the home island in Chios often had no news of their whereabouts for months.[1]
Business was flourishing at the time and soon N. F. Pittas could afford the purchase of more ships. The next ships purchased were the "Sotiras", a 780-ton ship that was bought in 1876 and the barque "Chios" the first 1,000 ton ship which was built in Chios in 1878. A few other ships followed. Some were entrusted initially to brothers of N. F. Pittas and subsequent purchases to his sons.[1]
Key executives[edit]

Mr Aristides J. Pittas — Chairman, Chief Exec. Officer and Press
Dr Anastasios Aslidis — Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Treasurer

Competitive Strengths




Business Strategy







NASDAQ Closing Bell CeremonyApril 2, 2007









Competitive Strengths








We believe that we possess the following competitive strengths: 

 



· Experienced Management Team. Our management team has significant experience in all aspects of commercial, technical, operational and financial areas of our business. Aristides J. Pittas, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, holds a dual graduate degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and Ocean Systems Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has worked in various technical, shipyard and ship management capacities and since 1991 has focused on the ownership and operation of vessels carrying dry cargoes. Dr. Anastasios Aslidis, our Chief Financial Officer, holds a Ph.D. in Ocean Systems Management also from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has over 20 years of experience, primarily as a partner at a Boston based international consulting firm focusing on investment and risk management in the maritime industry. 

 



·  Cost Efficient Vessel Operations. We believe that because of the efficiencies afforded to us through Eurobulk, the strength of our management team and the quality of our fleet, we are, and will continue to be, a reliable, low cost vessel operator, without compromising our high standards of performance, reliability and safety. Despite the average age of our fleet being approximately 16.15 years on March 31, 2017 during 2016, our total vessel operating expenses, including management fees and general and administrative expenses but excluding drydocking expenses were $5,883 per day for the year ended December 31, 2016. We consider this amount to be among the lowest of the publicly listed drybulk or containerships shipping companies in the United States. Our technical and operating expertise allows us to efficiently manage and transport a wide range of cargoes with a flexible trade route profile, which helps reduce ballast time between voyages and minimize off-hire days. Our professional, well-trained masters, officers and on board crews further help us to control costs and ensure consistent vessel operating performance. We actively manage our fleet and strive to maximize utilization and minimize maintenance expenditures for operational and commercial utilization. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our operational fleet utilization was 99.8%, up from 99.4% in 2015, while our commercial utilization rate increased from 93.9% in 2015 to 95.7% in 2016. Our total fleet utilization rate in 2016 was 95.5%. 




·   Strong Relationships with Customers and Financial Institutions. We believe ourselves, Eurobulk, Eurobulk FE and the Pittas family to have developed strong industry relationships and to have gained acceptance with charterers, lenders and insurers because of long-standing reputation for safe and reliable service and financial responsibility through various shipping cycles. Through Eurobulk and Eurobulk FE, we offer reliable service and cargo carrying flexibility that enables us to attract customers and obtain repeat business. We also believe that the established customer base and reputation of ourselves, Eurobulk, Eurobulk FE and the Pittas family help us to secure favorable employment for our vessels with well-known charterers.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.
