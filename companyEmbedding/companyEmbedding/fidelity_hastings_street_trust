DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Once the new year begins, many people start reviewing their finances and        
calculating their tax bills. No one wants to pay more taxes than they have      
to. But a recent survey of 500 U.S. households, conducted by Fidelity and       
Yankelovich Partners, showed that few people have taken steps to reduce

new tax laws were retroactive to January 1993.

these changes, it may make sense to consider ways to keep more of what you      
earn.                                                                           
First, if your employer offers a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement savings plan,      
consider enrolling. These plans are set up so you can make regular              
contributions -                                                                 
before taxes - to a retirement savings plan. They offer a disciplined           
savings strategy, the ability to accumulate earnings tax-deferred, and          
immediate tax savings. For example, if you earn $40,000 a year and              
contribute 7% of your salary to your 401(k) plan, your annual contribution      
is $2,800. That reduces your taxable income to $37,200 and, if you're in        
the                                                                             
28% tax bracket, saves you $784 in federal taxes. In addition, you pay no       
taxes on any earnings until withdrawal.                                         
It may be a good idea to contact your benefits office as soon as possible       
to find out when you can enroll or increase your contribution. Most             
employers allow employees to make changes only a few times each year.           
Second, consider an IRA. Many people are eligible to make an IRA                
contribution (up to $2,000) that is fully tax deductible. That includes         
people who are not covered by company pension plans, or those within            
certain income brackets. Even if you don't qualify for a fully deductible       
contribution, any IRA earnings will grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.         
Third, consider tax-free investments like municipal bonds and municipal         
bond funds. Often these can provide higher after-tax yields than comparable     
taxable investments. For example, if you're in the new 36% federal income       
tax bracket and invest $10,000 in a taxable investment yielding 7%, you'll      
pay $252 in federal taxes and receive $448 in income. That same $10,000         
invested in a tax-free bond fund yielding 5.5% would allow you to keep $550     
in income.                                                                      
These are three investment strategies that could help lower your tax bill       
in 1994. If you're interested in learning more, please call us at

PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance. You can     
look at the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage     
change, or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Each                
performance figure includes changes in a fund's share price, plus               
reinvestment of any dividends (or income) and capital gains (the profits        
the fund earns when it sells stocks that have grown in value).

(including 3% sales charge) 2.72%                                           

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS reflect the fund's actual performance over a set       
period - in this case, since the fund began on September 17, 1993. For          
example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the     
past year, you would have $1,050. Once the fund has a longer record, you        
may want to compare it to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock         
Price Index - a common proxy for the U.S. stock market. You may also want       
to look at the performance of the average capital appreciation fund, as         
tracked by Lipper Analytical Services. Both benchmarks include reinvested       
dividends and capital gains, if any. They will appear in the fund's next        
report six months from now.                                                     
AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURNS and the growth of a hypothetical $10,000                 
INVESTMENT in the fund will also appear in the next report.

for example, has a history of                                                   
growth in the long run and

An interview with Scott Stewart,                                                
Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Fifty                                             
Q. SCOTT, HOW HAS THE FUND PERFORMED?                                           
A. The fund broke out of the gate pretty quickly, returning 5.90% from its      
start date on September 17, 1993 to December 31, 1993. For the fourth           
quarter - September 30 through year end - it returned 3.01%. By comparison,     
the average capital appreciation fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services     
returned 1.91% for the same period. I'm encouraged by the strong start, but     
I would caution against expecting the fund to maintain the same pace in         
'94.                                                                            
Q. WHAT SETS FIDELITY FIFTY APART FROM OTHER CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUNDS?        
A. The biggest and most obvious difference is its limited number of stocks      
- generally 50 to 60 companies. In that way, it's designed to look like the     
personal portfolio of an active investor. The fund also differs from many       
of its peers because of my extensive use of quantitative techniques. When       
choosing a stock, I first use a computer program to screen more than 7,000      
names followed by Fidelity's research department, identifying the 75 to 100     
that appear most attractive. At that point, I do both fundamental analysis      
- a close-up "human" examination of the company's business prospects - and      
more quantitative research to help me narrow the list. I also use computer      
programs to help me systematically analyze elements of a company's make-up      
that might make its stock risky, critical information for a fund that           
invests in so few stocks. A stock's estimated level of risk helps me            
determine how heavily to invest. I don't play hunches and I usually avoid       
overriding the conclusions of the risk analysis.                                
Q. SO WHAT DO YOU, AND THE COMPUTER, LOOK FOR IN A POTENTIAL STOCK?             
A. I look for companies that seem to be undergoing a change for the better      
in their business prospects. Companies that, for one reason or another, now     
have a more positive outlook, usually in terms of their balance sheets or       
earnings prospects. Sometimes it's a company that has done poorly and whose     
stock has dropped in price, but the research suddenly shows it has improved     
earnings potential. Other times I invest in companies that have been doing      
well for a while, and whose earnings forecasts are now even better. I build     
the portfolio using a "bottom up" approach. That simply means I focus on        
the merits of individual companies, rather than on industry sectors.            
Turnover in this fund will be high. If a company's business prospects           
suddenly look less attractive relative to its stock price, I'll sell it and     
find a replacement. With only 50 stocks, I can't afford to stick with a         
laggard very long.                                                              
Q. WHAT SPECIFIC BETS HAVE PAID OFF SO FAR?                                     
A. There were several. Amgen was the fund's second largest investment at        
year end. The company has several successful drugs on the market, including     
one that's increasingly used in chemotherapy to treat cancer patients.          
Amgen's stock rose 20% from the end of September to the end of December.        
Health care was the fund's largest sector investment on December 31, at         
13.3%. As a whole, the group had an off year in '93, due mainly to              
uncertainty over health-care reform. But Amgen is a good example of the         
type of health-care company the fund sought out; those that now have            
attractive products on the market or will soon have new products coming         
out. At 11.3%, media and leisure was the fund's second biggest sector at        
year end. Some media companies have improved their cost structures and may      
soon see better revenues. Newspaper company Times-Mirror is an example. The     
company has strong assets, and should see increasing revenues as                
advertising picks up again. The stock is up roughly 20% since the fund          
bought it in September.                                                         
Q. TECHNOLOGY AND RETAIL WERE AMONG THE FUND'S OTHER LARGE INDUSTRY GROUPS      
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS. WHAT OPPORTUNITIES DID YOU FIND IN THESE SECTORS?     
A. I had to be careful picking technology stocks when the fund started in       
September. By that time, investors had bid up prices to levels that were        
quite high; and tech stocks tend to be very volatile.                           
I think the fund's most interesting story in this sector has been IBM. We       
hadn't heard much about IBM since its steep plunge from its glory days on       
Wall Street. But in September, I felt the supply of mainframe systems like      
IBM produces was decreasing while demand seemed to be increasing. The           
company was cutting costs and looked like it was becoming less                  
bureaucratic. Most importantly, the company appeared to be underestimating      
its own earnings prospects. The stock was the fund's top investment for a       
while, and rose more than 25% from the end of September to the end of           
December.                                                                       
Q. WHAT ABOUT RETAIL?                                                           
A. Most retail stocks had a tough year but some have rebounded lately as        
consumer confidence has picked up. The fund's most successful retail pick       
was the Gap. Interestingly, every Friday my group here at Fidelity has          
"casual day" when we're allowed to leave our dress clothes at home. Many of     
us have talked about our need for more "business" casual clothes, like we       
can find at stores like the Gap. I think this example is part of a larger       
trend that fits in well with the Gap's story. I bought the stock when the       
fund began because I felt the Gap was well managed when retail stores were      
suffering. They watched their inventory levels and were poised to benefit       
when sales picked up, which they have. The bet paid off. The Gap's stock        
went from $29.50 per share at the end of September to $39.38 per share by       
the end of December.                                                            
Q. WHAT WERE THE FUND'S LARGEST INVESTMENTS AT YEAR END?                        
A. The fund's biggest investment on December 31 was Stanhome, a                 
manufacturer of consumer products and business goods. Improving business        
prospects and a stock price that showed Stanhome was undervalued compared       
to its peer group made the company attractive. Stanhome's shipments of          
household goods are up and so is the stock: about 10% since the fund            
invested in it in early November. We've already discussed Amgen, the fund's     
second largest investment. Third was Cooper Tire, which I just bought in        
late December. The company should benefit as its competitors reduce their       
production of lower-priced tires. COR Therapeutics was next. The company        
has strong management and produces successful drugs for angina and              
angioplasty. I bought the stock in October, and it was up nearly 7% by year     
end. Enterra Corporation rounds out the top five. I was drawn in by rising      
demand for Enterra's tool rentals and pipeline equipment, along with the        
company's low stock price relative to its business prospects. The fund          
bought Enterra in November, and the stock rose roughly 5% through the end       
of December.                                                                    
Q. ANY DISAPPOINTMENTS SO FAR?                                                  
A. The biggest was Fruit-of-the-Loom. Fall sales weren't as strong as I had     
expected. I sold the stock as the price began dropping, but it would have       
helped to get out earlier. As we've already discussed, poor performance         
from any one stock can have a significant effect on the entire fund.            
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 1994?                        
A. There's no doubt market valuations are high by historical measures. And      
the market certainly could decline in the next six months if interest rates     
climb or corporate earnings begin to suffer. Lately, the fund has been          
leaning toward investing in smaller, more growth-oriented companies - those     
with accelerating earnings. As the economy picks up steam, I think the          
business prospects of these companies may tend to improve faster than those     
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. My hope is, as a result, the fund       
will outperform the index.

SCOTT STEWART ON LIMITING RISK:                                                 
"The fate of any one stock has                                                  
a bigger effect on this fund than                                               
it would on a fund that holds                                                   
hundreds of securities. That's                                                  
why the fund plays by certain                                                   
rules that aim to help keep risk                                                
in check. First, I try to make                                                  
sure any given stock makes up                                                   
no more than 3% of the fund's                                                   
investments, and I'll further                                                   
restrict stocks with risky                                                      
prospects. Second, the fund                                                     
will not be overweighted in any                                                 
industry group by more than                                                     
10%. For example, at year end                                                   
the health-care sector made up                                                  
7% of the stocks in the                                                         
Standard &amp; Poor's 500                                                       
index. That means the fund                                                      
wouldn't have more than a                                                       
17% stake in health care.                                                       
Third, I have liquidity                                                         
requirements for stocks I buy                                                   
for the fund. If a stock doesn't                                                
trade often enough, I won't                                                     
invest in it. That helps ensure                                                 
that I can sell a stock quickly if I                                            
have to."

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING                                                       
POLICIES.                                                                       
Fidelity Fifty (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Hastings Street Trust (the      
trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares. The trust      
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the         
1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company organized as a          
Massachusetts business trust. The following summarizes the significant          
accounting policies of the fund:                                                
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are readily        
available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale price, at the        
closing bid price. Securities  for which exchange quotations are not            
readily available (and in certain cases debt securities which trade on an       
exchange), are valued primarily using dealer-supplied valuations or at          
their fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied         
procedures under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.              
Short-term securities maturing within sixty days are valued at amortized        
cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of which approximate          
current value.                                                                  
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and             
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the current exchange rate. Purchases and sales of securities,        
income receipts and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at        
the exchange rate on the dates of the transactions.                             
It is not practical to identify the portion of each amount shown in the         
fund's Statement of Operations under the caption "Realized and Unrealized
Gain (Loss) on Investments" that arises from changes in foreign currency        
exchange rates. Investment income includes net realized and unrealized          
currency gains and losses recognized between accrual and payment dates.         
INCOME TAXES. The fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company     
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. By so qualifying, the fund     
will not be subject to income taxes to the extent that it distributes all       
of its taxable income for its fiscal year. The schedule of investments          
includes information regarding income taxes under the caption "Income Tax       
Information."                                                                   
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,         
except certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date     
may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the            
ex-dividend date. Interest income is accrued as earned. Dividend and            
interest income is recorded net of foreign taxes where recovery of such         
taxes is not assured.                                                           
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund.      
Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned between the        
funds in the trust.                                                             
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING                                                       
POLICIES - CONTINUED                                                            
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date.                                                               
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The fund, through its custodian, receives delivery       
of the underlying securities, whose market value is required to be at least     
102% of the resale price at the time of purchase. The fund's investment         
adviser, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (FMR), is responsible       
for determining that the value of these underlying securities remains at        
least equal to the resale price.                                                
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission, the fund, along with other registered       
investment companies having management contracts with FMR, may transfer         
uninvested cash balances into a joint trading account. These balances are       
invested in one or more repurchase agreements that are collateralized by        
U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                                    
FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS. The fund may invest in futures contracts and     
write options. These investments involve, to varying degrees, elements of       
market risk and risks in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement       
of Assets and Liabilities. The face or contract amounts reflect the extent      
of the involvement the fund has in the particular classes of instruments.       
Risks may be caused by an imperfect correlation between movements in the        
price of the instruments and the price of the underlying securities and         
interest rates. Risks also may arise if there is an illiquid secondary          
market for the instruments, or due to the inability of counterparties to        
perform.                                                                        
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day       
by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Options traded      
on an exchange are valued using the last sale price or, in the absence of a     
sale, the last offering price. Options traded over-the-counter are valued       
using dealer-supplied valuations.                                               
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF                                                       
INVESTMENTS.                                                                    
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $78,907,445 and $34,141,298, respectively, of which purchases of     
U.S. government and government agency obligations aggregated $248,293.          
There were no sales of U.S. government and government agency obligations.       
The market value of futures contracts opened and closed amounted to             
$6,047,335 and $2,785,320, respectively.                                        
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a monthly        
basic fee that is calculated on the basis of a group fee rate plus a fixed      
individual fund fee rate applied to the average net assets of the fund. The     
group fee rate is the weighted average of a series of rates ranging from        
.30% to .52% and is based on the monthly average net assets of all the          
mutual funds advised by FMR. The annual individual fund fee rate is .30%.       
The basic fee is subject to a performance adjustment (up to a maximum of +      
or - .20%) based on the fund's investment perform-ance as compared to the       
appropriate index over a specified period of time. The fund's performance       
adjustment will not take effect until September 1994. For the period, the       
management fee was equivalent to an annualized rate of .62% of average net      
assets.                                                                         
The Board of Trustees approved a new group fee rate schedule with rates         
ranging from .2850% to .5200%. Effective November 1, 1993, FMR has              
voluntarily agreed to implement this new group fee rate schedule as it          
results in the same or a lower management fee.                                  
SALES LOAD. For the period, Fidelity Distributors Corporation, an affiliate     
of FMR and the general distributor of the fund, received sales charges of       
$412,358 on sales of shares of the fund.                                        
TRANSFER AGENT FEE. Fidelity Service Co. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, is the     
fund's transfer, dividend disbursing and shareholder servicing agent. FSC       
receives fees based on the type, size, number of accounts and the number of     
transactions made by shareholders. FSC pays for typesetting, printing and       
mailing of all shareholder reports, except proxy statements.                    
ACCOUNTING FEE. FSC maintains the fund's accounting records. The fee is         
based on the level of average net assets for the month plus out-of-pocket       
expenses.                                                                       
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. The fund placed a portion of its portfolio               
transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of FMR. The              
commissions paid to these affiliated firms were $9,839 for the period.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Although financial turmoil in Pacific Basin countries was a catalyst            
for significant volatility in U.S. markets throughout the fourth                
quarter, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose more than 33% in 1997,            
about three times its historical annual average. Meanwhile, bond                
markets - primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive          
news on the inflation front - continued to post solid returns as the            
year drew to a close.                                                           
While it's impossible to predict the future direction of the markets            
with any degree of certainty, there are certain basic principles that           
can help investors plan for their future needs.                                 
First, investors are encouraged to take a long-term view of their               
portfolios. If you can afford to leave your money invested through the          
inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets, you will                
greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline. We know from           
experience, for example, that stock prices have gone up over longer             
periods of time, have significantly outperformed other types of                 
investments and have stayed ahead of inflation.                                 
Second, you can further manage your investing risk through                      
diversification. A stock mutual fund, for instance, is already                  
diversified, because it invests in many different companies. You can            
increase your diversification further by investing in a number of               
different stock funds, or in such other investment categories as                
bonds. If you have a short investment time horizon, you might want to           
consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund,               
which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in                     
high-quality, short-term investments. Of course, it's important to              
remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will               
achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1.00 per           
share, and that these types of funds are neither insured nor                    
guaranteed by any agency of the U.S. government.                                
Finally, no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity, it            
makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing a               
certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or                
quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio. By doing             
so, you won't get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising               
market, nor will you buy all your shares at market highs. While this            
strategy - known as dollar cost averaging - won't assure a profit or            
protect you from a loss in a declining market, it should help you               
lower the average cost of your purchases.                                       
If you have questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We are                 
available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide you the                  
information you need to make the investments that are right for you.            
Best regards,                                                                   
Edward C. Johnson 3d                                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance.             
You can look at the total percentage change in value, the average               
annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000                
investment. Total return reflects the change in the value of an                 
investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's dividend income and             
capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities that              
have grown in value). Fidelity Fifty has a 3% sales charge, which was           
waived beginning January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1998.

CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUNDS AVERAGE       8.97%    20.36%   N/A                  

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage              
terms over a set period - in this case, six months, one year or since           
the fund started on September 17, 1993. For example, if you had                 
invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return, over the past year,             
the value of your investment would be $1,050. You can compare the               
fund's returns to the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index -          
a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stocks. To measure how           
the fund's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare            
it to the capital appreciation funds average, which reflects the                
performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper           
Analytical Services, Inc. The past six months average represents a              
peer group of 238 mutual funds. These benchmarks reflect reinvestment           
of dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of               
sales charges.

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS take the fund's cumulative return and              
show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a                
constant rate each year. (Note: Lipper calculates average annual total          
returns by annualizing each fund's total return, then taking an                 
arithmetic average. This may produce a slightly different figure than           
that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and                     
annualizing the result.)

$10,000 OVER LIFE OF FUND:  Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was           
invested in Fidelity Fifty on September 17, 1993, when the fund                 
started, and the current 3% sales charge was paid. As the chart shows,          
by December 31, 1997, the value of the investment would have grown to           
$20,135 - a 101.35% increase on the initial investment. For                     
comparison, look at how the S&P 500 did over the same period. With              
dividends and capital gains, if any, reinvested, the same $10,000               
investment would have grown to $23,417 - a 134.17% increase.

How a fund did yesterday is                                                     
no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and                                                            
short-term volatility. In turn, the

fund that invests in stocks will                                                
vary. That means if you sell                                                    
your shares during a market

money. But if you can ride out

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with Scott Stewart, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Fifty            
Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM, SCOTT?                                             
A. It was a difficult period over the past six months, but the fund             
was ahead of its peers for the year. For the six months that ended              
December 31, 1997, the fund returned 5.93%. This trailed the capital            
appreciation funds average, which returned 8.97% according to Lipper            
Analytical Services. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index returned 10.58%.           
For the 12 months that ended December 31, 1997, the fund returned               
23.06%, while the Lipper group and S&P 500 returned 20.36% and 33.36%,          
respectively.                                                                   
Q. WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED PERFORMANCE?                                           
A. Market dynamics played a key role. Through the end of September,             
stocks of small- and medium-sized companies - which Fidelity Fifty              
tends to emphasize to a greater extent than the S&P 500 - performed             
nicely relative to the large-capitalization stocks that heavily weight          
the S&P 500. In fact, the Russell 2000 Index - which measures the               
performance of small-cap stocks - outgained the S&P 500 by a healthy            
margin during the months of August and September. Beginning in                  
October, however, the fortunes of small-cap stocks took a downturn as           
global volatility - specifically caused by currency turmoil in                  
Southeast Asia - came into play. When markets experience the type of            
turmoil we saw during that time, investors tend to favor larger, more           
steady stocks over smaller, aggressive-growth stocks. Since Asia                
accounts for a significant portion of world semiconductor production,           
most of the fund's semiconductor equipment stocks - such as KLA                 
Tencor, which the fund no longer held at the end of the period, and             
ASM Lithography - declined during this turmoil. In addition, some of            
the fund's positions with considerable Asian business exposure were             
hurt. Citicorp, the fund's largest holding at the end of the period,            
was a prime example. Citicorp remained a top holding at the end of the          
period because I felt the impact of this Asian volatility - over the            
long-term - would be small. The company also has good risk controls in          
place.                                                                          
Q. IN TERMS OF PORTFOLIO VOLATILITY, HOW DOES A FUND SUCH AS FIDELITY           
FIFTY - WHICH IS COMPRISED OF BETWEEN 50 TO 60 STOCKS - FARE RELATIVE           
TO A MORE DIVERSIFIED STOCK FUND WHEN EVENTS OCCUR SUCH AS WE HAD IN            
ASIA?                                                                           
A. Because of the concentration of this fund, it will most likely               
experience a stronger jolt than a diversified stock fund will in times          
of volatility. A diversified stock fund invests in hundreds of                  
different stocks in all sorts of industries. With Fidelity Fifty, I             
try to maintain a good degree of diversity among those 50 to 60                 
stocks.                                                                         
Q. WHEN THE MARKET CHANGES TO REWARD STOCKS OF DIFFERENT SIZES, DO YOU          
CHANGE YOUR INVESTING PHILOSOPHY?                                               
A. Over the long term, individual stock selection will provide the              
primary source of active performance. However, market dynamics, such            
as the significant outperformance of large-cap stocks during the past           
few years, may dominate stock selection over shorter periods of time.           
The bottom-up process I follow - choosing stocks based more on a                
company's business prospects than on industry or economic trends -              
leads to the selection of large-cap names as well as small- and                 
medium-cap stocks. However, I don't try to actively switch between              
large- and small-caps in anticipation of the outperformance of one              
category over the other. This would be market timing and - similar to           
trying to predict the direction of interest rates - is usually an               
exercise in futility. Many unpredictable factors, such as the economic          
climate and interest rates, determine the performance of large stocks           
versus small stocks.                                                            
Q. SIX MONTHS AGO YOU EXPLAINED WHY HOLDING FUTURES CAN BE AN                   
EFFECTIVE PART OF YOUR STRATEGY. DID YOU CONTINUE TO USE THESE                  
INSTRUMENTS DURING THE PERIOD?                                                  
A. I did. Futures - which made up around 9% of the fund's assets at             
the end of the period - have been a part of my strategy since the fund          
began in 1993. Investing in futures - either of the S&P 500 or Russell          
2000 variety - allows the fund to stay fully invested while                     
shareholders move money into and out of it. The way I think of it is            
that returns from futures plus the fund's cash position equals the              
approximate return of stocks. That is, the profits from futures, plus           
the fund's base of cash added together can perform very much like a             
stock index does. During the period, the fund's Russell 2000 futures            
performed well when small-caps surged, and the S&P 500 futures                  
contributed positively as large-cap stocks regained momentum in the             
fourth quarter.                                                                 
Q. YOU INCREASED THE FUND'S MEDIA-RELATED STOCKS DURING THE PERIOD.             
WHAT WAS THE DRAW?                                                              
A. Two of the fund's larger media stock positions - Viacom and CBS              
Corp. - performed well for different reasons. Viacom realized strong            
performance from both its movie production and Blockbuster video                
rental businesses. After a period of sluggish growth, investors                 
finally started to recognize the value of Blockbuster. CBS benefited            
after a string of acquisitions and proactive restructuring efforts              
began to show signs of taking hold.                                             
Q. WHICH STOCKS PERFORMED WELL? WERE THERE ANY DISAPPOINTMENTS?                 
A. Positions that contributed positively included thrift stock Dime             
Bancorp - which benefited from improved balance-sheet management, loan          
growth and takeovers in the finance industry; Falcon Drilling, which            
specializes in deep-water oil exploration; and retail stock TJX                 
Companies. Among the disappointments were business-service stock Sitel          
and disk-drive manufacturer Quantum.                                            
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK?                                                         
A. Not to sound like a broken record, but I'm a firm believer that              
earnings and interest rates are the two main factors behind stock               
performance. With the currency and potential economic crises in Asia -          
and the expected slowing of global growth as a result - earnings                
growth for multinational companies may be at risk. In the short term,           
at least, deflation in some overseas markets - a scenario in which              
goods and products become cheaper for U.S. consumers - appears to               
indicate that interest rates will remain relatively stable. If                  
interest rates rise, large-cap stocks could suffer. That being said,            
my goal continues to be to find attractive stocks one at a time and             
not try to time the markets.

industry, and I think there's more                                              
to come.

dropped recently, a company like                                                
Falcon Drilling might continue to                                               
perform well. The company is                                                    
involved more in deep-water oil                                                 
exploration, where the oil reserves                                             
are more plentiful. Deep-water                                                  
exploration is expensive, but the                                               
rewards can be fruitful."

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Fidelity Fifty (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Hastings Street Trust           
(the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares.           
The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as            
amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company            
organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The financial statements           
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting             
principles which permit management to make certain estimates and                
assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The following              
summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund:                     
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are                
readily available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale              
price, at the closing bid price. Securities for which exchange                  
quotations are not readily available (and in certain cases debt                 
securities which trade on an exchange) are valued primarily using               
dealer-supplied valuations or at their fair value as determined in              
good faith under consistently applied procedures under the general              
supervision of the Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with                
remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which quotations are             
not readily available are valued at amortized cost or original cost             
plus accrued interest, both of which approximate current value.                 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Income               
receipts and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the           
prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions.           
Purchases and sales of securities are translated into U.S. dollars at           
the contractual currency exchange rates established at the time of              
each trade.                                                                     
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions                  
represent net gains and losses from sales and maturities of foreign             
currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, and the                  
difference between the amount of net investment income accrued and the          
U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of changes in                 
foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are                
included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on                   
investment securities.                                                          
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under                 
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to           
income taxes to the extent that it distributes substantially all of             
its taxable income for its fiscal year. The schedule of investments             
includes infor-mation regarding income taxes under the caption "Income          
Tax Information."                                                               
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend               
date, except certain dividends from foreign securities where the                
ex-dividend date may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is           
informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in                
dividend income, if any, are recorded at                                        
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                  
INVESTMENT INCOME - CONTINUED                                                   
the fair market value of the securities received. Interest income,              
which includes, accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as             
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld             
where recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                      
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a            
fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned              
among the funds in the trust.                                                   
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date.                                                               
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance              
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted            
accounting principles. These differences, which may result in                   
distribution reclassifications, are primarily due to differing                  
treatments for futures and options transactions, market discount and            
losses defferred due to wash sales. The fund also utilized earnings             
and profits distributed to shareholders on redemption of shares as a            
part of the dividends paid deduction for income tax purposes.                   
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Undistributed net investment income and accumulated undistributed net           
realized gain (loss) on investments may include temporary book and tax          
basis differences which will reverse in a subsequent period. Any                
taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end is distributed in           
the following year.                                                             
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of            
trade date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the           
basis of identified cost.                                                       
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund generally uses foreign currency            
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated                     
securities. Losses may arise from changes in the value of the foreign           
currency or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'           
terms. The U.S. dollar value of foreign currency contracts is                   
determined using contractual currency exchange rates established at             
the time of each trade. The cost of the foreign currency contracts is           
included in the cost basis of the associated investment.                        
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the fund, along with              
other affiliated entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company             
(FMR), may transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint             
trading accounts. These balances are invested in one or more                    
repurchase agreements that mature in 60 days or less from the date of           
purchase for U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                       
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are                        
marked-to-market daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the          
principal amount of the repurchase agreement (including accrued                 
interest). FMR, the fund's investment adviser, is responsible for               
determining that the value of the underlying securities remains in              
accordance with the market value requirements stated above.                     
TAXABLE CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by             
the SEC, the fund may invest in the Taxable Central Cash Fund (the              
Cash Fund) managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc.               
(formerly FMR Texas Inc.), an affiliate of FMR. The Cash Fund is an             
open-end money market fund available only to investment companies and           
other accounts managed by FMR and its affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks           
preservation of capital, liquidity, and current income by investing in          
U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements for these                    
securities. Income distributions from the Cash Fund are declared daily          
and paid monthly from net interest income. Income distributions earned          
by the fund are recorded as interest income in the accompanying                 
financial statements.                                                           
FUTURES CONTRACTS. The fund may use futures contracts to manage its             
exposure to the stock market. Buying futures tends to increase the              
fund's exposure to the underlying instrument, while selling futures             
tends to decrease the fund's exposure to the underlying instrument or           
hedge other fund investments. Futures contracts involve, to varying             
degrees, risk of loss in excess of the futures variation margin                 
reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The underlying            
face amount at value of any open futures contracts at period end is             
shown in the schedule of investments under the caption "Futures                 
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the                
underlying instrument at period end. Losses may arise from changes in           
the value of the underlying instruments or if the counterparties do             
not perform under the contracts' terms. Gains and losses are realized           
upon the expiration or closing of the futures contracts. Futures                
contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by            
the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.                        
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $137,501,552 and $126,128,872, respectively.                         
The market value of futures contracts opened and closed during the              
period amounted to $79,544,776 and $77,982,247, respectively.                   
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser,FMR receives a                 
monthly fee that is calculated on the basis of a group fee rate plus a          
fixed individual fund fee rate applied to the average net assets of             
the fund. The group fee rate is the weighted average of a series of             
rates and is based on the monthly average net assets of all the mutual          
funds advised by FMR. The rates ranged from .2500% to .5200% for the            
period. The annual individual fund fee rate is .30%. In the event that          
these rates were lower than the contractual rates in effect during the          
period, FMR voluntarily implemented the above rates, as they resulted           
in the same or a lower management fee. The basic fee is subject to a            
performance adjustment (up to a maximum of (plus/minus).20% of the              
fund's average net assets over the performance period) based on the             
fund's investment performance as compared to the appropriate index              
over a specified period of time. For the period, the management fee             
was equivalent to an annualized rate of .43% of average net assets              
after the performance adjustment.                                               
SALES LOAD. For the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1998,           
Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), an affiliate of FMR and the            
general distributor of the fund, will voluntarily waive the sales               
charge (3% of the offering price) on the sales of shares.                       
TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an                   
affiliate of FMR, is the fund's transfer, dividend disbursing and               
shareholder servicing agent. FSC receives account fees and asset-based          
fees that vary according to account size and type of account. FSC pays          
for typesetting, printing and mailing of all shareholder reports,               
except proxy statements. For the period, the transfer agent fees were           
equivalent to an annualized rate of .26% of average net assets.                 
ACCOUNTING FEES. FSC, an affiliate of FMR, maintains the fund's                 
accounting records. The fee is based on the level of average net                
assets for the month plus out-of-pocket expenses.                               
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. The fund placed a portion of its portfolio               
transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of FMR. The              
commissions paid to these affiliated firms were $28,548 for the                 
period.                                                                         
5. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR has directed certain portfolio trades to brokers who paid a                 
portion of the fund's expenses. For the period, the fund's expenses             
were reduced by $22,221 under this arrangement.                                 
In addition, the fund has entered into arrangements with its custodian          
and transfer agent whereby credits realized as a result of uninvested           
cash balances were used to reduce a portion of expenses. During the             
period, the fund's custodian and transfer agent fees were reduced by            
$203 and $993, respectively, under these arrangement.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Although financial turmoil in Pacific Basin countries was a catalyst            
for significant volatility in U.S. markets throughout the fourth                
quarter, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose more than 33% in 1997,            
about three times its historical annual average. Meanwhile, bond                
markets - primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive          
news on the inflation front - continued to post solid returns as the            
year drew to a close.                                                           
While it's impossible to predict the future direction of the markets            
with any degree of certainty, there are certain basic principles that           
can help investors plan for their future needs.                                 
First, investors are encouraged to take a long-term view of their               
portfolios. If you can afford to leave your money invested through the          
inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets, you will                
greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline. We know from           
experience, for example, that stock prices have gone up over longer             
periods of time, have significantly outperformed other types of                 
investments and have stayed ahead of inflation.                                 
Second, you can further manage your investing risk through                      
diversification. A stock mutual fund, for instance, is already                  
diversified, because it invests in many different companies. You can            
increase your diversification further by investing in a number of               
different stock funds, or in such other investment categories as                
bonds. If you have a short investment time horizon, you might want to           
consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund,               
which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in                     
high-quality, short-term investments. Of course, it's important to              
remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will               
achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1.00 per           
share, and that these types of funds are neither insured nor                    
guaranteed by any agency of the U.S. government.                                
Finally, no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity, it            
makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing a               
certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or                
quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio. By doing             
so, you won't get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising               
market, nor will you buy all your shares at market highs. While this            
strategy - known as dollar cost averaging - won't assure a profit or            
protect you from a loss in a declining market, it should help you               
lower the average cost of your purchases.                                       
If you have questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We are                 
available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide you the                  
information you need to make the investments that are right for you.            
Best regards,                                                                   
Edward C. Johnson 3d                                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate a fund's historical performance.             
You can look at the total percentage change in value, the average               
annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000                
investment. Total return reflects the change in the value of an                 
investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's dividend income and             
capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale of securities that              
have grown in value).                                                           
CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS

FIDELITY FUND                      12.48%   32.06%   155.24%   395.08%          
S&P 500 (REGISTERED TRADEMARK)     10.58%   33.36%   151.62%   425.77%          
GROWTH & INCOME FUNDS AVERAGE      9.93%    27.14%   125.21%   335.80%          

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage              
terms over a set period - in this case, six months, one year, five              
years or 10 years. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund            
that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment           
would be $1,050. You can compare the fund's returns to the performance          
of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index - a widely recognized, unmanaged             
index of common stocks. To measure how the fund's performance stacked           
up against its peers, you can compare it to the growth & income funds           
average, which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar            
objectives tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. The past six             
months average represents a peer group of 657 mutual funds. These               
benchmarks reflect reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if              
any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

GROWTH & INCOME FUNDS AVERAGE      27.14%   17.53%   15.71%                     

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURNS take the fund's cumulative return and              
show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a                
constant rate each year. (Note: Lipper calculates average annual total          
returns by annualizing each fund's total return, then taking an                 
arithmetic average. This may produce a slightly different figure than           
that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and                     
annualizing the result.)

$10,000 OVER 10 YEARS: Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was                
invested in Fidelity Fund on December 31, 1987. As the chart shows, by          
December 31, 1997, the value of the investment would have grown to              
$49,508 - a 395.08% increase on the initial investment. For                     
comparison, look at how the S&P 500 did over the same period. With              
dividends and capital gain, if any, reinvested, the same $10,000                
investment would have grown to $52,577 - a 425.77% increase.

no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with Beth Terrana, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Fund              
Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM, BETH?                                              
A. Quite well. For the six months that ended December 31, 1997, the             
fund returned 12.48%. This topped the Standard & Poor's 500 Index,              
which returned 10.58% during the same period. The fund also                     
outperformed the growth and income funds average, which returned                
9.93%, according to Lipper Analytical Services. For the 12 months that          
ended December 31, 1997, the fund returned 32.06%. The index and the            
Lipper peer group returned 33.36% and 27.14%, respectively, during              
that time.                                                                      
Q. WHAT FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE FUND'S STRONG SHOWING?                       
A. The main driver behind the fund's solid performance - and the area           
where I focus most of my attention - was stock selection. Foremost,             
I'd point to retail store investments, where both stock picking and an          
industry overweighting - more than double that of the S&P 500 - were            
positive contributors. During the period, in fact, retailing stocks             
were among the strongest industry groups in the S&P 500. Specifically,          
good individual contributors included Consolidated Stores - which owns          
Kay-Bee Toy stores - and Gap, Inc., which operates several                      
leading-edge apparel chains. The fund also benefited from stock                 
selection within the finance, health care and technology sectors.               
Strong performers in these industries included BankAmerica, drug-maker          
Bristol-Myers Squibb and personal computer-maker Compaq.                        
Q. CONTINUING WITH THE RETAIL STORY, THE FUND'S EXPOSURE TO THIS                
SECTOR CLIMBED TO AROUND 10% OF ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31. WHY WERE              
THESE STOCKS APPEALING?                                                         
A. I detected several positive industry trends that I felt provided a           
favorable backdrop. Among these trends were a reduction in store                
overcapacity - or less overall floor space - that had hurt the                  
industry for some time; a keener focus on the bottom line, or                   
earnings, by company managements; and new-found attention to returns            
on invested capital. While it would be a stretch to say that all                
retailers recently have mended their ways, it was clear to me that              
there were a number of attractive stocks with the potential for upward          
revaluations of their price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples. The story              
behind big discounter Wal-Mart - the fund's largest retail investment           
at the end of the period - illustrates my theory. Following the                 
company's rapid growth during the 1980s - which resulted in very                
strong stock appreciation - Wal-Mart's returns deteriorated and its             
stock dramatically underperformed the market from 1993 through 1996.            
Recognizing that it had a problem, Wal-Mart committed itself to a new           
financial discipline, emphasizing returns on its capital base, and              
earnings growth began to accelerate. Based on these positive                    
developments, the stock recently began to perform well.                         
Q. WHAT CHARACTERISTICS DO YOU LOOK FOR WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO BUY A          
STOCK?                                                                          
A. I've always been a bottom-up investor who believes that superior             
investment performance emanates from owning stocks of companies with            
improving financial returns. Improvements in financial returns drive            
both sustainable improvements in a company's secular growth rate, and           
its earnings power. When I'm analyzing the pros and cons of a stock,            
the important factors I look for include restructuring potential,               
rising returns on invested capital, good balance sheet management,              
strong free cash flow and shareholder-friendly management. More                 
recently, global franchises and strong brands have also increasingly            
become important factors. I've generally found that companies                   
exhibiting some or all of these attributes tend to generate improving           
financial returns - including expanding profit margins and                      
accelerating earnings growth rates - through time. Further, as a                
firm's financial returns improve, its stock is likely to be rewarded            
with a higher valuation once the market catches on.                             
Q. TIME WARNER IS A RELATIVELY NEW TOP 10 HOLDING. WHAT MADE THIS               
STOCK ATTRACTIVE DURING THE PERIOD?                                             
A. Fundamentally, the company has a number of media franchises -                
including Warner Brothers, Time Warner Cable, CNN and Time magazine -           
with wide global reach. Also, the company has been focusing intently            
on improving its financial returns. For example, previously high                
levels of capital spending - largely related to its cable television            
operations - were expected to peak and then decline, a development              
that I felt could enhance the company's free-cash-flow dynamics. The            
potential for this to occur - and for Time Warner to continue                   
expanding and enhancing its worldwide franchises as a result - made             
this stock attractive.                                                          
Q. WHICH OTHER STOCKS PERFORMED WELL DURING THE PERIOD? WHICH WERE              
DISAPPOINTMENTS?                                                                
A. Other strong performers included General Electric, diversified-              
industrial Tyco International and IBM. There weren't any major                  
setbacks, but several smaller positions - including Columbia/HCA                
Healthcare and Waste Management - lagged the market. The fund no                
longer held Waste Management at the close of the period.                        
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE COMING MONTHS?                                   
A. Given the economic difficulties we saw in Southeast Asia during the          
last quarter of 1997, global economic growth may be sluggish. If there          
is such a slowdown, stocks with predictable, sustainable earnings               
growth likely will outperform economically sensitive cyclical stocks            
and commodities-based stocks. Of course, those companies with                   
significant revenue exposure to the Asian region could be particularly          
affected, so I'll continue to try to limit the fund's investments to            
companies whose earnings are susceptible to such a slowdown.

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING:                                                        
"During the past decade, we've                                                  
witnessed enormous                                                              
improvements in the                                                             
competitiveness of U.S.                                                         
companies. These improvements                                                   
have been achieved mostly                                                       
through productivity-enhancing                                                  
measures, such as cutting costs                                                 
and improving technology. Given                                                 
this backdrop, I'm often asked                                                  
whether U.S. companies can                                                      
continue to derive gains from                                                   
these efforts. I believe the answer                                             
is `yes,' but that we are entering a new                                        
and somewhat different phase.                                                   
"While undoubtedly there will                                                   
always be ways to reduce costs                                                  
and increase productivity, the                                                  
majority of the basic                                                           
income-related improvements                                                     
have been accomplished. Instead,                                                
companies are now more focused                                                  
on their balance sheets. Under this                                             
new balance-sheet-driven                                                        
approach, managements are

on capital. In keeping with this                                                
philosophy, businesses that                                                     
generate robust returns on capital                                              
are grown, while underperformers

6. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Fidelity Fund (the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Hastings Street Trust            
(the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares.           
The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as            
amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company            
organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The financial statements           
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting             
principles which permit management to make certain estimates and                
assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The following              
summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund:                     
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are                
readily available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale              
price, at the closing bid price. Securities (including restricted               
securities) for which exchange quotations are not readily available             
(and in certain cases debt securities which trade on an exchange) are           
valued primarily using dealer-supplied valuations or at their fair              
value as determined in good faith under consistently applied                    
procedures under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees.              
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less           
for which quotations are not readily available are valued at amortized          
cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of which approximate          
current value.                                                                  
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Income               
receipts and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the           
prevailing exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions.           
Purchases and sales of securities are translated into U.S. dollars at           
the contractual currency exchange rates established at the time of              
each trade.                                                                     
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions                  
represent net gains and losses from sales and maturities of foreign             
currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, and the                  
difference between the amount of net investment income accrued and the          
U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of changes in                 
foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are                
included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on                   
investment securities.                                                          
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under                 
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to           
income taxes to the extent that it distributes substantially all of             
its taxable income for its fiscal year. The schedule of investments             
includes information regarding income taxes under the caption "Income           
Tax Information."                                                               
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend               
date, except certain dividends from foreign securities where the                
ex-dividend date may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is           
informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in                
dividend income, if any, are recorded at the fair                               
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                  
INVESTMENT INCOME - CONTINUED                                                   
market value of the securities received. Interest income is accrued as          
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld             
where recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                      
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a            
fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned              
among the funds in the trust.                                                   
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date.                                                               
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance              
with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted            
accounting principles. These differences, which may result in                   
distribution reclassifications, are primarily due to differing                  
treatments for litigation proceeds, foreign currency transactions,              
market discount, partnerships, non-taxable dividends and losses                 
deferred due to wash sales. The fund also utilized earnings and                 
profits distributed to shareholders on redemption of shares as a part           
of the dividends paid deduction for income tax purposes.                        
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Undistributed net investment income and accumulated undistributed net           
realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign currency transactions           
may include temporary book and tax basis differences which will                 
reverse in a subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining            
at fiscal year end is distributed in the following year.                        
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of            
trade date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the           
basis of identified cost.                                                       
7. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund generally uses foreign currency            
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated                     
securities. Losses may arise from changes in the value of the foreign           
currency or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'           
terms. The U.S. dollar value of foreign currency contracts is                   
determined using contractual currency exchange rates established at             
the time of each trade. The cost of the foreign currency contracts is           
included in the cost basis of the associated investment.                        
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), the fund, along with              
other affiliated entities of Fidelity Management & Research Company             
(FMR), may transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint             
trading accounts. These balances are invested in one or more                    
repurchase agreements that mature in 60 days or less from the date of           
purchase for U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.                       
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are                        
marked-to-market daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the          
principal amount of the repurchase agreement (including accrued                 
interest). FMR, the fund's investment adviser, is responsible for               
determining that the value of the underlying securities remains in              
accordance with the market value requirements stated above.                     
TAXABLE CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by             
the SEC, the fund may invest in the Taxable Central Cash Fund (the              
Cash Fund) managed by Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc.               
(formerly FMR Texas Inc.), an affiliate of FMR. The Cash Fund is an             
open-end money market fund available only to investment companies and           
other accounts managed by FMR and its affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks           
preservation of capital, liquidity, and current income by investing in          
U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements for these                    
securities. Income distributions from the Cash Fund are declared daily          
and paid monthly from net interest income. Income distributions earned          
by the fund are recorded as interest income in the accompanying                 
financial statements.                                                           
RESTRICTED SECURITIES. The fund is permitted to invest in securities            
that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These          
securities generally may be resold in transactions exempt from                  
registration or to the public if the securities are registered.                 
Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations            
and expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult.           
At the end of the period, the fund had no investments in restricted             
securities (excluding 144A issues).                                             
8. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $2,761,450,000 and $2,564,464,000, respectively.                     
9. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser,FMR receives a                 
monthly fee that is calculated on the basis of a group fee rate plus a          
fixed individual fund fee rate applied to the average net assets of             
the fund. The group fee rate is the weighted average of a series of             
rates and is based on the monthly average net assets of all the mutual          
funds advised by FMR. The rates ranged from .2500% to .5200% for the            
period. The annual individual fund fee rate is .09%. In the event that          
these rates were lower than the contractual rates in effect during the          
period, FMR voluntarily implemented the above rates, as they resulted           
in the same or a lower management fee. For the period, the management           
fee was equivalent to an annualized rate of .38% of average net                 
assets.                                                                         
TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an                   
affiliate of FMR, is the fund's transfer, dividend disbursing and               
shareholder servicing agent. FSC                                                
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES - CONTINUED                      
TRANSFER AGENT FEES - CONTINUED                                                 
receives account fees and asset-based fees that vary according to               
account size and type of account. FSC pays for typesetting, printing            
and mailing of all shareholder reports, except proxy statements. For            
the period, the transfer agent fees were equivalent to an annualized            
rate of .17% of average net assets.                                             
ACCOUNTING AND SECURITY LENDING FEES. FSC maintains each fund's                 
accounting records and administers the security lending program. The            
security lending fee is based on the number and duration of lending             
transactions. The accounting fee is based on the level of average net           
assets for the month plus out-of-pocket expenses.                               
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS. The fund placed a portion of its portfolio               
transactions with brokerage firms which are affiliates of FMR. The              
commissions paid to these affiliated firms were $810,000 for the                
period.                                                                         
10. SECURITY LENDING.                                                           
The fund loaned securities to certain brokers who paid the fund                 
negotiated lenders' fees. These fees are included in interest income.           
The fund receives U.S. Treasury obligations and/or cash as collateral           
against the loaned securities, in an amount at least equal to 102% of           
the market value of the loaned securities at the inception of each              
loan. This collateral must be maintained at not less than 100% of the           
market value of the loaned securities during the period of the loan.            
At period end, the value of the securities loaned and the value of              
collateral amounted to $33,080,000 and $34,199,000, respectively.               
11. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                         
FMR has directed certain portfolio trades to brokers who paid a                 
portion of the fund's expenses. For the period, the fund's expenses             
were reduced by $594,000 under this arrangement.                                
In addition, the fund has entered into arrangements with its custodian          
and transfer agent whereby credits realized as a result of uninvested           
cash balances were used to reduce a portion of expenses. During the             
period, the fund's custodian and transfer agent fees were reduced by            
$3,000 and $120,000, respectively, under these arrangements.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Laura J. Riegel, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6873 or Dalia Osman Blass, Assistant Director, at (202) 551-6821 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

See prospectus for a full list of fund managers.



Investment Returns, Risks and ComplexitiesCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. A prospectus, obtained by calling 800-669-3900 or by clicking on the prospectus link, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.A mutual fund is not FDIC-insured, may lose value, and is not guaranteed by a bank or other financial institution. Performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results, and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from mutual fund companies, including those participating in its no-load, no-transaction-fee program, for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative and distribution services. The amount of TD Ameritrade's remuneration for these services is based in part on the amount of investments in such funds by TD Ameritrade clients. PLEASE ALSO SEE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL FUND FEE DISCLOSURE INFORMATIONNo-transaction-fee funds and other funds offered through TD Ameritrade have other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the fund and are described in the prospectus.Mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are subject to market, exchange rate, political, credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks, which vary depending on the type of fund.  International investments involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and political and economic instability. Asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Fund purchases may be subject to investment minimums, eligibility and other restrictions, as well as charges and expenses.Although certain money market funds seek to preserve their value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.  Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain circumstances.Some mutual funds sold through TD Ameritrade impose a charge on the purchase of shares, called a “sales load.” An investor may be able to purchase fund shares through TD Ameritrade without paying a front-end sales load, but an investor  may be charged a fee, called a “contingent deferred sales charge,” when the investor sells or redeems shares.  TD Ameritrade may receive part or all of the sales load.Some mutual funds offer reductions in front-end sales loads (“breakpoints”) for purchases over certain amounts or purchases through Letters of Intent or Rights of Accumulation.  Some funds also offer waivers of those loads, often to retirement plans or charities.  Such breakpoints or waivers will be as further described in the prospectus. You, as the investor, should determine and obtain any breakpoints or waivers or provide TD Ameritrade with sufficient information to assist it in obtaining them.Most mutual funds charge 2.00% on the redemption of shares (including by exchange) held for less than a certain number of calendar days.  Performance figures reported do not reflect the deduction of this fee. If reflected, the fee would reduce the performance quoted. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for redemption fee information. TD Ameritrade may also charge its own short-term redemption fee.See the SEC Guide to Mutual Funds for more information.TD AMERITRADE RISKS OF INVESTING IN FUNDS: PLEASE READ IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUND, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND, AND CLOSED-END FUND RISK DISCLOSURESResearch and planning tools are obtained by unaffiliated third-party sources deemed reliable by TD Ameritrade. However, TD Ameritrade does not guarantee their accuracy and completeness and makes no warranties with respect to results to be obtained from their use. The Investment Profile report is for informational purposes only.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Investment Management LLC is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.
