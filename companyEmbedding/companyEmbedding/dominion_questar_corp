History[edit]
Questar Corporation's origins began in 1928, as a holding company named Western Public Service Corporation. That company was formed to bring natural gas to the Salt Lake City region of northern Utah from fields across the state border to the east in southwestern Wyoming. Mountain Fuel Supply Company was at that time the name of the holding company's oil and gas exploration and production affiliate.[1]
Mountain Fuel Supply[edit]
In 1935, the shareholders voted to reorganize Western Public Service Corporation as a single company. Mountain Fuel Supply Company (MFS) then became the name of the reorganized consolidated company,[1] which was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under that name from then until 1984.[2] Beginning in 1935, it also paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since that time.[3]
In 1963, the company began to use a new trademark logo, in the shape of a trapezoid. That logo remained in use until becoming Questar Gas in 1998.[1]
Questar Corporation[edit]
In 1984, Mountain Fuel Supply Company shareholders voted to return to the holding-company structure, and chose the name Questar Corporation as the new parent holding company name. Questar Corporation continues to trade on the NYSE, under its stock symbol STR.[3]
Questar's New Headquarters — Questar Center[edit]
Construction began in August 2010 on a new $45 million 6-story building at 333 South State Street in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The new facility was completed and opened in March 2012. The 170,000-square-foot (16,000 m2) building replaces Questar's former headquarters located at 180 East 100 South. The new Questar Center building is one of the first LEED Silver energy-efficient buildings in downtown Salt Lake. The new headquarters accommodates some 600 Questar employees in a floor plan that is 20 percent smaller than Questar's former headquarters. Employees working at Questar's D.N. Rose operation center in Salt Lake City will continue to operate from that location as well.
Deregulation[edit]
On January 1, 1998, Mountain Fuel Supply Company was renamed Questar Gas Company, bringing all of Questar's divisions under the single Questar brand name. The move was prompted by new deregulation in the energy industry, which allowed the company to offer wider choices to customers, and to venture into new lines of business. The old Mountain Fuel Supply name had been primarily associated with natural gas delivery up until that time. In 1998 the Questar Corporation also began to use its newly reworked version of the traditional trapezoid logo throughout the organization.[1]
At the time, R. D. Cash was chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar Corporation.[1]
Other Questar affiliates were already moving into newly available energy market areas, such as Questar Energy Trading, which had begun to market electricity on the wholesale level, and Questar Energy Services, which had begun selling retail products including earthquake braces and carbon-monoxide monitors, and providing home-security and appliance-maintenance services. Also, Questar InfoComm began selling information technology and telecommunications.[1]
By 1998, Questar Corporation had become one of the largest companies headquartered in Utah, with 2,500 employees and about US$1.8 billion in assets. The company had two major divisions:

Regulated Services, included retail natural gas distribution and interstate natural gas transportation
Market Resources, included natural gas and oil exploration and production, wholesale and retail energy trading and marketing, natural gas gathering and other field services.[1]

In April 2003, D. N. "Nick" Rose, president and chief executive officer of Questar Regulated Services, retired and Alan K. Allred, who served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the QRS group, succeed Rose.[4]
By 2006, the Regulated Services segment had been subdivided instead into segments named Questar Gas and Questar Pipeline, for a total of three primary subsiary companies within Questar, with four major lines of business:[5]

gas and oil exploration and production
midstream field services
interstate gas transportation
retail gas distribution

In 2005, Knox Lawrence International acquired Consonus Inc., a Questar subsidiary which was formed 5 years ago and had housed and managed computer data centers for dozens of businesses. Questar Corp. was getting out of the data center management business.[6]
E&P Business Spin-Off[edit]
On July 1, 2010, Questar Market Resources (QMR) exploration and production business was spun off to form a new publicly traded company, QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE: QEP). QEP established its company headquarters in Denver, Colo. Questar Corporation's board of directors elected Ron W. Jibson as president and CEO.
On October 19, 2014 Tesoro Logistics LP agreed to buy QEP Resources Inc.’s natural-gas pipeline and processing business for $2.5 billion in cash to expand its business in the Rocky Mountains and North Dakota.
Dominion Resources[edit]
It was announced on February 1, 2016 that Dominion Resources, an energy company based in Richmond, Virginia, would be purchasing Questar Corporation for $25 dollars a share (about $4.4 billion).[7]
On September 16, 2016 the Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation merger was officially completed. Dominion Questar becomes the official name for the Salt Lake City based subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Current CEO of Questar Corporation, Ron Jibson, is named to the board of directors at Dominion Resources following the completion of the merger.[8]
Business Structure[edit]
Questar's operations consist of three major lines of business — retail gas distribution, interstate gas transportation and gas production.[5]
Questar Gas Company[edit]
Questar Gas Company (QGC) — retail gas distribution — is a public natural gas utility in Utah, southwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho.
Questar Pipeline Company[edit]
Questar Pipeline Company (QPC) — interstate pipeline and storage in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.

Questar Pipeline
Southern Trails Pipeline, from the San Juan County, New Mexico Blanco Hub through the San Juan Basin to California
Clay Basin storage facility, in the Rocky Mountains
gathering lines and processing plants near Price, Utah

Wexpro Company[edit]
Wexpro Company (WEX) — develops and produces gas and oil on certain properties for affiliate Questar Gas under the terms of a long-standing comprehensive agreement with the states of Utah and Wyoming. Wexpro delivers natural gas production to Questar Gas at a price equal to Wexpro's cost of service.

RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:   D) and Questar Corporation (NYSE:   STR) today announced an agreement for the companies to combine, in an all-cash transaction in which Dominion has agreed to pay Questar shareholders $25 per share – about $4.4 billion – and assume Questar's outstanding debt. 
The transaction would be accretive to Dominion upon closing – expected by year-end 2016 – with limited impact on the company's balance sheet. Dominion intends to finance the transaction in a manner that supports the company's existing credit ratings targets, using equity, mandatory convertibles and debt at Dominion, and equity at Dominion Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:   DM). The Dominion-Questar combination also is expected to support Dominion's 2017 earnings growth rate and allow the company to reach the top of or exceed its 2018 growth targets.
Questar, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a natural gas distribution, pipeline, storage and cost-of-service gas supply company. It serves nearly 1 million homes and businesses in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho, with approximately 97 percent of those customer accounts in Utah. Questar employs about 1,700 people and has about $4.2 billion in assets, including approximately 27,500 miles of gas distribution pipeline, 3,400 miles of gas transmission pipeline and 56 billion cubic feet of working gas storage. Its regional cost-of-service gas supply business has provided reliable supply and saved Questar Gas customers more than $1 billion over the past 35 years under a public service commission-approved framework.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion, said:
"Dominion is very pleased to join with Questar. Like Dominion, Questar has a history of safe and reliable operations, integrity and a firm commitment to its employees and the communities it serves. Questar's customers can count on a continuation of the high-quality service they have enjoyed for years. 
"This addition is well-aligned with Dominion's existing strategic focus on core regulated energy infrastructure operations. Questar boasts best-in-sector customer growth in states with strong pro-business credentials and constructive regulatory environments. These high-performing regulated assets will improve Dominion's balance between electric and gas operations and provide enhanced scale and diversification into Questar's regulatory jurisdictions.
"Of note, Dominion Midstream investors will benefit from the addition of Questar, as it is expected to contribute more than $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's inventory of top-quality, low-risk MLP-eligible assets, supporting Dominion Midstream's targeted annual cash distribution growth rate of 22 percent.
"Questar is the ideal mix for Dominion shareholders and Dominion Midstream unitholders alike."
Ron Jibson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar, said:
"Questar is excited to be joining the Dominion family of companies and serve as the hub of its Western operations. Our similar cultures and commitment to customers, shareholders, communities and employees make this a win-win transaction. Dominion's reputation among its peers and analysts is unmatched. We're proud to become part of America's most-admired gas and electric utility."
Adds geographic diversity to Dominion portfolio
Questar would provide enhanced geographic diversity to Dominion's natural gas operations. Dominion's existing operations lie in the heart of the mid-Atlantic, whereas Questar's system is the "hub of the Rockies" and a principal source of gas supply to Western states. Dominion expects the value of the Questar pipeline system to rise over time as Utah and other Western states seek to comply with the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan and meet state-mandated renewable standards, with increasing reliance on low-carbon, gas-fired electric generation.
The combined company would serve about 2.5 million electric utility customers and 2.3 million gas utility customers in seven states. It also would operate more than 15,500 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, one of the nation's largest natural gas storage systems, and approximately 24,300 megawatts of generation.  
Separate from this transaction, Dominion has committed about $1 billion for three solar generating facilities located in Beaver, Iron and Millard counties, Utah. These solar facilities are backed by long-term power purchase agreements with local electric utilities.
Terms of transaction & advisers
Upon transaction closing, Questar shareholders will receive $25 in cash for each share of Questar common stock. This represents an approximate 30 percent premium to the volume-weighted average stock price of Questar's last 20 trading days ended Jan. 29, 2016.
Pending approvals, Questar will operate as a first-tier, wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion and maintain its significant presence, local management structure and headquarters in Salt Lake City. Dominion has also agreed to increase community involvement and charitable investment in the communities currently served by Questar.
The transaction requires approval of Questar's shareholders and clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Questar and Dominion also will file for review and approval, if required, from the Utah Public Service Commission and the Wyoming Public Service Commission, and provide information regarding the transaction to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission.
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, and Mizuho Bank, Ltd., have provided committed financing and are acting in the role of financial advisers to Dominion. Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as the exclusive financial adviser to Questar.
McGuireWoods LLP served as legal counsel to Dominion and Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel to Questar.

Dominion leadership will discuss the announced combination on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call at 12 p.m. ET today. Domestic callers should dial (877) 410-5657. The passcode for the call is "Dominion."  International callers should dial (334) 323-9872.

RICHMOND, Va., Sept. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:   D), and Questar Corporation announced today that they have completed their proposed merger, forming one of the nation's largest combined electric and natural gas energy companies.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:








"We are pleased to complete our strategic combination with Questar, and to continue serving our Questar customers in the West with the same commitment and dedication to safety and excellence to which they – and our customers along the Eastern Seaboard and Midwest – are accustomed. Questar's high-performing regulated businesses also improve our geographic diversity and enhance our balance between electric and gas operations."
Questar's "hub of the Rockies" system is a principal gateway for gas supply to Western states. Dominion expects that demand on Questar's pipeline system will rise as Western states rely increasingly on low-carbon, natural gas-fired generation to comply with potentially stringent federal clean air requirements and to support state-mandated renewable standards. Questar's gas distribution operations benefit from being located in one of the country's fastest growing regions. 
"Questar's businesses are ideally located to take advantage of the growth opportunities due to the changing energy landscape, benefiting the economies of the states in which they operate," Farrell said. 
The combined company includes:

2.5 million electric utility customer accounts in Virginia and North Carolina; 
2.3 million natural gas utility customer accounts in Idaho, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming; 
1.3 million retail energy and related services customer accounts in 13 states; 
14,400 miles of natural gas gathering, storage and transmission pipeline and nearly 51,000 miles of gas distribution pipeline; 
6,500 miles of electric transmission lines and 57,300 miles of electric distribution lines; 
25,700 megawatts of electric production in 11 states; and 
More than a trillion cubic feet of natural gas storage.
Ronald W. Jibson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar, said:
"From our initial meetings with Dominion leaders it was evident from our similar strategies, cultures, values, and employee and safety focus that Dominion was an excellent company to combine with to move us into the future. After working through a very smooth merger, I'm more confident than ever that this opportunity to combine with one of the nation's best energy companies will benefit Questar customers, employees, shareholders and the communities we serve."
Benefit to customers, communitiesQuestar – now Dominion Questar – will operate as a first-tier, wholly owned subsidiary of Dominion. Questar's principal operating companies – Questar Gas, Questar Pipeline and Wexpro – have retained their names as of closing.
Dominion Questar will maintain its significant local presence with a local management structure drawn from existing Questar employees. Questar Gas' headquarters also will remain in Salt Lake City, along with a new Western Regional operating headquarters there.
Effective today, Questar CEO Jibson has retired and has been elected to Dominion's board of directors. Craig C. Wagstaff has been named president of Dominion Questar. He will lead Dominion's Western natural gas operations and be responsible for all current Questar operating companies. 
Other benefits of the Dominion-Questar combination include:

A $75 million contribution to Questar employee retirement plans, at Dominion shareholder expense; 
Withdrawal of a $22 million rate increase request in Utah, thereby stabilizing base rates until 2020; 
An agreement in Wyoming to freeze base rates at current levels until at least Jan. 1, 2020; 
A commitment to maintain Questar Gas' excellent customer service levels, with frequent reporting to state public service commissions; 
A $1 million per year increase in charitable giving in Dominion Questar's service area for at least the next five years, at Dominion shareholder expense; 
Establishment of a new Western region operating headquarters in Salt Lake City; and 
Maintaining environmental monitoring and maintenance programs at Questar Gas at or above current levels.
Jibson elected to Dominion's board of directorsDominion's board of directors has elected Jibson as director, effective today. The election brings the size of the Dominion board to 11.
"Ron Jibson will bring to Dominion's board more than three decades of expertise in the energy infrastructure field, with a strong reputation for providing excellent customer service, protecting the environment and operating safely and efficiently," Farrell said. "We look forward to adding Ron's outstanding capabilities, intellect and insights to our board."
Until his retirement today, Jibson, 63, served as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar Corporation since 2012. Jibson joined Questar in 1980 and has held various operations and engineering positions within the company and its gas transmission and distribution subsidiaries. He has served or is serving on a number of industry, corporate and community boards, including the board of directors of the American Gas Association (past chairman); Western Energy Institute (past chairman); Gas Technology Institute; IDACORP, Inc.; his alma mater Utah State University's board of trustees (chairman); the Salt Lake Chamber Board of Governors (chairman); and the Utah Symphony/Utah Opera board, among others. Jibson received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Utah State and an MBA from Westminster College.   
Dominion MidstreamDominion Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:   DM), of which Dominion is the general partner and the majority holder of limited partner units, is also expected to benefit from the addition of Questar Corporation. "We expect Dominion Questar to contribute more than $425 million of EBITDA to Dominion's inventory of top-quality, low-risk MLP-eligible assets, supporting Dominion Midstream's targeted annual cash distribution growth rate of 22 percent," Farrell said.
Dominion has agreed to take all necessary action to appoint a current member of the Questar board as a director to serve on the board of directors of the general partner of Dominion Midstream as soon as practicable after such time as all or part of Questar Pipeline is contributed to Dominion Midstream. 
Terms of transaction Under the terms of the merger agreement, as of market close on Sept. 16, 2016, each Questar share has been canceled and shareholders are to receive $25.00 per share of common stock – or about $4.4 billion. Dominion has also assumed approximately $1.5 billion of Questar's outstanding debt. Questar shareholders of record as of the close of business Sept. 16, 2016, will also receive a pro-rated dividend of $0.07018 per share of common stock, payable Sept. 19, 2016.
Questar Corporation common stock will cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange prior to market open on Sept. 19, 2016. Additional information for Questar shareholders may be found at https://www.dom.com/corporate/investors/shareholder-services/merger-information.

  Updated Feb. 1, 2016 7:54 a.m. ET





 Dominion Resources Inc. agreed to buy Questar Corp. for about $4.4 billion in cash, in a move to expand its natural gas operations beyond the mid-Atlantic and into the West. Richmond, Va.-based Dominion will pay $25 a share for Salt Lake City-based Questar, representing a 23% premium to where Questar’s stock closed on Friday. Dominion said it also would assume Questar’s debt—as of Sept. 30, Questar had roughly $1.31 billion in short...
