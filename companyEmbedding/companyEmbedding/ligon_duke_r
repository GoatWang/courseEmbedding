TEPPCO Partners, L.P. Names Duke R. Ligon and Irvin Toole, Jr. to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































TEPPCO Partners, L.P. Names Duke R. Ligon and Irvin Toole, Jr. to 
      Board of Directors






April 23, 2009 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TEPPCO Partners, L.P. (NYSE:TPP) today announced that Duke R. Ligon and 
      Irvin Toole, Jr. have been elected to the board of directors of its 
      general partner, Texas Eastern Products Pipeline Company, LLC, effective 
      April 22, 2009. In addition, both have been appointed to serve as 
      members of the board’s Audit, Conflicts and Governance Committee. On 
      March 12, 2009, TEPPCO announced that Chairman of the Board, Murray H. 
      Hutchison, had withdrawn from the Audit, Conflicts and Governance 
      Committee in conjunction with the expansion of his responsibilities to 
      include interim executive authority.
    


      “With their in-depth understanding of the master limited partnership 
      structure and broad experience in the crude oil and refined products 
      areas that comprise our core pipeline business segments, I’m confident 
      that both gentlemen will be productive additions to our board and we are 
      very pleased and fortunate to have them part of the team,” said Jerry 
      Thompson, president and chief executive officer of TEPPCO’s general 
      partner. “These latest additions bring the total number of members on 
      the TEPPCO board to seven, five of which are independent directors.”
    

      Since 2007, Mr. Ligon has served as a strategic advisor for Love’s 
      Travel Stops & Country Stores, Inc. in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Prior to 
      his current responsibilities, he spent 11 years as general counsel and 
      senior vice president for Devon Energy Corporation. During his nearly 
      40-year career, Mr. Ligon has served in numerous legal, regulatory and 
      legislative advisory roles, providing counsel on a wide range of 
      energy-related issues. He earned a J.D. from the University of Texas and 
      a bachelor’s degree from Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri.
    

      From 1998 to 2006, Mr. Toole served as president, chief executive 
      officer and director for the general partner of Pacific Energy Partners, 
      L.P. and its predecessor companies. During his tenure, he initiated the 
      development of a major new crude oil import terminal at the Port of Los 
      Angeles and completed a series of acquisitions totaling more than $1 
      billion. His energy experience spans more than 40 years and includes 
      various executive level financial and operational positions with several 
      large integrated crude oil and refined products pipeline companies. Mr. 
      Toole holds a master’s degree and a bachelor’s degree in civil 
      engineering from Texas A&M University and completed the Advanced 
      Management Program at Harvard Business School.
    

      TEPPCO Partners, L.P., is a publicly traded energy logistics partnership 
      with operations that span much of the continental United States. TEPPCO 
      owns and operates an extensive network of assets that facilitate the 
      movement, marketing, gathering and storage of various commodities and 
      energy-related products. The partnership’s midstream network is 
      comprised of approximately 12,500 miles of pipelines that gather and 
      transport refined petroleum products, crude oil, natural gas, liquefied 
      petroleum gases (LPGs) and natural gas liquids, including one of the 
      largest common carrier pipelines for refined petroleum products and LPGs 
      in the United States. TEPPCO’s storage assets include approximately 27 
      million barrels of capacity for refined petroleum products and LPGs and 
      about 14 million barrels of capacity for crude oil. TEPPCO also owns a 
      marine business that operates primarily on the United States inland and 
      Intracoastal Waterway systems, and in the Gulf of Mexico. For more 
      information, visit TEPPCO’s website (www.teppco.com). 
      Texas Eastern Products Pipeline Company, LLC, the general partner of 
      TEPPCO Partners, L.P., is owned by Enterprise GP Holdings (NYSE:EPE).
