How to Invest
 





					Objective				

Cook & Bynum seeks long-term growth of capital by making concentrated investments in a select few undervalued domestic and foreign businesses. We do not artificially constrain ourselves by style boxes or other arbitrary factors. Instead, we are opportunistic. We will go anywhere we can find value across geographic regions, industry sectors, and market capitalizations. This pure value investing philosophy has been heavily influenced by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, John Burr Williams, Warren Buffett, and Charles Munger, among others.
To minimize the risk of permanent capital loss and maximize long-term returns, we make our investment selections using the following core criteria:



Circle of Competence
We only invest in businesses whose core economics and future prospects we can understand and reliably predict. We know our ability to recognize our limitations will be as important as our ability to execute competencies.




Business
We seek to invest in companies that have durable competitive advantages that allow them to produce predictable cash flows and earn high returns on equity for extended periods of time. Without sustainable competitive advantages, a company’s results will be difficult to effectively forecast.



People
We invest in companies whose management teams are capable and trustworthy, think and act like shareholders, employ conservative balance sheet and other accounting policies, and make wise capital allocation decisions. The risk of permanent capital loss can be lowered significantly if we only invest in businesses whose managers view shareholders as partners.



Price
We seek to invest in companies whose shares are trading at significant discounts to our estimate of their intrinsic values, as this “margin of safety” serves to both prevent permanent capital loss when we make mistakes and also provide outsized returns when we are correct.


We use fundamental, bottom-up research to carefully assess whether an individual company meets these core criteria. This research often includes, but is not limited to, review and analysis of company filings, discussions with management, visits to company facilities, and conversations with the company’s customers, competitors, and suppliers. When a company appropriately satisfies the first three of these criteria (Circle of Competence, Business, and People), we will value it by projecting the future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and then discounting these ‘‘owner earnings’’ into present-value dollars using an appropriate interest rate. We will only buy a company’s security only as long as it is trading at a large discount to our conservative appraisal of its intrinsic value.

					Why the Arch?				

As the supporting scaffolding was removed following the completion of a Roman arch, the responsible engineer was required to stand beneath it. This approach ensured that the engineer designed and built the arch with a substantial margin of safety.
At Cook & Bynum, we have applied the lessons of this highly effective quality control system in two distinct ways.  First, we only make investments in companies whose securities provide an appropriate “margin of safety” – meaning they trade at a significant discount to our appraisal of their intrinsic values.  Second, we believe it is imperative to have our interests closely and fully aligned with those of our investors. To accomplish this objective, we invest substantially all of our liquid net worth alongside our investors and are more than willing to “eat our own cooking.”  As a result, we manage our partners’ money exactly how we manage our own.
We feel it is essential to our long-term success that we have partners who share our goals, so we seek those who are focused on long-term investment results rather than short-term market fluctuations.  Having partners focusing on the latter will almost certainly compromise our long-term results.

Why Are We Different?

					Building Our Portfolio				

Establishing and Sizing Positions

We typically build concentrated positions in equity securities as we prefer to invest more capital in our best ideas, recognizing that bigger stakes can be taken when information is adequate and outcomes are more certain.  Our assessment of the attractiveness of each potential investment is informed by our deep research, shaped by our requirement of a ‘margin of safety,’ and driven by the strict application of our core criteria, among other considerations.  This approach reflects our desire to make investments only when we feel that risk is low and potential returns are high.  Consistent with our long-range investment horizon, we define risk as the probability that a business performs materially worse than we predict, leading to a permanent loss of capital rather than a temporary decrease in the quoted price of a stock.  We specifically reject the concept that price volatility is a form of risk, and instead consider it our friend – an opportunity to either buy a business cheaply or sell it dearly.  In fact, because we anticipate being a large net purchaser of companies for the foreseeable future, we welcome low and declining prices to build positions – even in positions we currently hold.  We are only concerned with the intrinsic value of the businesses in which we invest.  Stagnant or declining prices in the face of solid business performance are simply an opportunity to own a greater proportion of the future profits of a business.
 

The position size of and concentration in each of our ideas are influenced by the Kelly Criterion.  Our main takeaway from Kelly is that a position’s size should be a function of both the security’s expected return and its potential range of outcomes, such that:

Although the math cannot be done explicitly in investing, it implies two critical points when thinking about how big a position should be in a portfolio (with the first point being more obvious than the second):
(i)     the larger the expected return, the bigger the position should be, and
(ii)    the larger the possible range of outcomes, the smaller the position should be.
As absolute value investors, we are comfortable holding cash and equivalents in the absence of compelling opportunities that meet our minimum hurdle rate requirements.  It is our obligation to not put our partners’ capital in harm’s way without the prospect of an adequate return, and cash allows us to act quickly in volatile and/or falling markets.  We are staunch adherents to the belief that the avenue to superior returns is being “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”  This investment strategy may not be the best way to earn high returns in any given year, but we believe it yields a portfolio that avoids the permanent capital losses endemic to short-term strategies, and earns the highest cumulative returns over a 20+ year time horizon.

Selling Positions
While our long-term approach typically produces low turnover and extended holding periods, we will generally sell a security under the following conditions:
»  We will begin to liquidate an investment when it appreciates to the point that it approaches or moves beyond our estimate of its intrinsic value.  An investment reaching our appraisal may have further upside potential, but it will no longer offer an appropriate margin of safety for putting capital at risk.
»  We will also sell any investment that has a material adverse change in business, management, or return prospects since we invested.  Negative developments by themselves do not necessarily trigger the selling of a position, but should an event lower our appraisal enough or prevent us from reliably appraising the intrinsic value of the investment, we will sell it.  Positive events may cause us to adjust our appraisal of value upwards.  We appraise our positions on an ongoing basis throughout the life of the investment.
»  Based on opportunity cost considerations, we will generally sell relatively overpriced securities to buy relatively underpriced securities as these specific opportunities arise.  This situation happens most often in times of market dislocations or disruptions.
