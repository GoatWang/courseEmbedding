and Retrieval system, or "EDGAR." Neither the Depositor nor the Trustee has
participated in the preparation of such reporting documents, or made any due
diligence investigation with respect to the information provided therein.

                         Independent Accountant's Report

To the Board of Directors
Structured Obligations Corporation
New York, New York

We have examined the compliance of Structured Obligations Corporation
(Depositor) and U.S. Bank National Association (Trustee) with the Base Trust
Agreement and the Select Notes Trust Supplement LT 2004-1 (the Agreements)
relating to the administration of the underlying securities and related credit
support deposited in or held by the Select Notes Trust LT 2004-1 for the period
June 18, 2004 through December 31, 2004. Depositor's management is responsible
for compliance with those requirements. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on compliance with the Agreements based on our examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about Depositor's and
Trustee's compliance with those requirements described above and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination of Depositor's and Trustee's
compliance with specified requirements.

In our opinion, Depositor and Trustee complied, in all material respects, with
the requirements described above of the Agreements for the period June 18, 2004
through December 31, 2004.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of Structured
Obligations Corporation, U.S. Bank National Association, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Certificate Holders of the Select Notes Trust LT
2004-1, and is not intended to be, and should not be used by anyone other than
those specified parties.
