In 2007, to find a solution to our problems, we began to research existing technologies known as "smart glass" or "electronic dimming windows". We were spell bounded by these systems but wondered why we did no...t see this in our daily lives. The answer is that these technologies have been too costly and too complex for any real market adoption. The reason why we founded the company is that we believe there is a simpler, more practical smart glass solution. VG Smartglass technology achieves this and has the potential to fundamentally change how people interactwith their window systems.  Milestones:  • 2007: The original SmarterShade founders met at the University of Notre Dame • 2008: Incorporated under Lono LLC in Indiana, raised $50K in seed money • 2008-2011: Conducted R&D and initial testing • 2012: SmarterShade Inc. was incorporated (Lono LLC dissolved) with intent of commercializing the technology.  • 2012-2014: SmarterShade Inc. established global supply and customer partnerships; continued to develop and test products, and commercialized initial products for the technology • 2015: SmarterShade Inc’s assets were acquired by VG SmartGlass and companies are “merged”  See MorePlacesChicago, IllinoisAutomotive, Aircraft & BoatVG SmartGlassAboutEnglish (US)EspañolFrançais (France)中文(简体)العربيةPortuguês (Brasil)Italiano한국어Deutschहिन्दी日本語MessengerFacebook LitePeoplePlacesGamesLocationsCelebritiesMarketplaceGroupsRecipesMomentsInstagramAboutCreate AdCreate PageDevelopersCareersPrivacyCookiesAd ChoicesTermsSettingsActivity Log Facebook © 2017

VG SmartGlass delivers instant privacy, glare, and energy control built into a windowBlinds and shades are awkward, they break, and are limited for energy control. Traditional smart glass is too complicated, expensive and needs power. The VG technology re-invents smart glass. A fraction of the cost of traditional smartglassNo electricity or phase changing materials Instant switchPatented material & product

The future of smart glassVG Smartglass is a revolutionary breakthrough in dynamic glazing. A user can make any window to go from clear to dark to dynamically adjust for privacy, glare, and energy control. Current “smart glass” alternatives are expensive and depend on electricity or phase changing materials. The VG technology is user controlled, requires no power or phase changing materials, and is a lower cost alternative to smart glass.  Applications range from interior privacy windows to curtain wall applications to automotive windows. Products are currently available for interior privacy vision lite kits and other select applications. Products for residential and commercial windows, along with automotive and transportation glass will be available starting in 2017Gallery
