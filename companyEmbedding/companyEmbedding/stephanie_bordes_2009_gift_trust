Shadowscapes - The Art of Stephanie Law































































About the Artist


Stephanie Law's work is an exploration of mythology mixed with her personal symbolism. Her art journeys through surreal otherworlds, populated by dreamlike figures, masked creatures, and winged shadows. The fantastical permeates through the visions, and you get a sense that this is a world that underlies our own, when viewed with a desire for beauty and a shifted perception.

Archetypes, the basis for the universal appeal of mythological concepts, are one of the defining inspirations for her imagery. This is mingled with the movement of dance. Stephanie has been a dancer for almost two decades, and she uses that experience of how the human body moves and emotes to create a bridge into her artwork so that not only do the humans dance across the page, but the very branches of her trees seem to move with a sinuous grace, and the arrangement of inanimate elements has a choreographed rhythm and flow.

Growing up in California, Stephanie has been surrounded by the wealth of natural inspiration all around her. The twisting boughs of live oaks from the hills near her home insinuate themselves into her paintings. The chaos of Nature's wild growth, and conversely the beauty of decay, echo in the textures and fractal patterns of her work.

She began her illustration career working with many fantasy gaming companies. Early on, she did pieces for Wizards of the Coast in Magic: the Gathering and Forgotten Realms, as well as with Skotos Tech (Castle Marrach), White Wolf (Changeling), Alderac Entertainment (Legend of Five Rings), and Green Ronin (Blue Rose). She also worked with publishing companies LUNA Books,Tachyon Books and Palazzo Editions.

In 2004, she embarked on a more personal long term project of what eventually was released in 2009 as The Shadowscapes Tarot, by Llewllyn Publishing. The tarot was an ideal melding of her fantasy experience with her desire for exploring archetypes and mythology. Since then, she has worked with Llewellyn Publishing on other projects, including an astrological calendar and an herbal guide. She currently has a new deck in the works, called the Dreamdance Oracle. She is also known for her series of watercolor technique books, "Dreamscapes", published through Impact Books, showing anyone how to pick up pencil and brush and embark on their own explorations into painting fantastic worlds and the creatures that inhabit them.

She exhibits original works with regular group shows at Krab Jab Studio in Seattle, WA, and solo shows; and has been a part of group shows with galleries in San Francisco, Nashville, and San Diego. Her work has also been included in the Spectrum annual of fantastic art in for several years, and at the Spectrum showcase in September 2014 at the Society of Illustrators in NY.  
Her recent work features insects, imaginative plants, and fae creatures, interwoven into a miniature world that is often overlooked, when size and physical permanence is equated with importance.

When not painting into the twilight hours, she can be found dancing, playing on her handpan or piano, and introducing her six year old daughter to the hidden beauties of the world.

U.S. Estate & Trust Income Tax
Form 1041 - Available in Windows & Mac Versions
This web page is out of date.
Click here to see the current product 
		information page.
Regardless of the foregoing, we designed this 
		program specifically for small- to medium-sized law offices, as well as 
		savvy individuals, that prepare simple returns for typical estates and 
		trusts. In many instances our users tell us they don't need or want the 
		complexity and added cost of high-price Form 1041 software. For most 
		commonly-filed returns, our U.S. Income Tax for Estates & Trusts 
		(W1041) program fits the bill perfectly for them!
The reality for most law offices is that 
		complicated returns are typically referred to accountants anyway, so why 
		spend more for a program that's designed to handle those types of 
		returns? 
The Tax Code requires a fiduciary income tax 
		return to be filed by nearly every estate or trust with a federal 
		identification number. Specifically, the regulations provide as follows:
"The fiduciary (or one of the joint 
		fiduciaries) must file Form 1041 for a domestic estate that has gross 
		income for the tax year of $600 or more."
So, even if you're not handling million 
		dollar estates, it's hard to find one that doesn't meet the filing 
		criteria described above. At a price of $49.99, W1041 pays 
		for itself as soon as you do your first return.
