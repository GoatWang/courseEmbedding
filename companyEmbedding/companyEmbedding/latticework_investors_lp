Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.

Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.

Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research
•  Prototype development
•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation
•  Invention presentation
•  Licensing negotiation
•  License agreement administration



So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Featured Licensed Product
 
 
 


Instant Trainer
L&L Licenses Pet Invention to As Seen on TV Marketer
Invented by Terry Silva 
The story of Terry Silva’s invention had a painful beginning.  After being dragged across the street, causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room, Terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her  110 pound German Shepherd-Alaskan Husky, named Ziggy.
“I went to the Dollar Store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen,” said Silva.  “I was pleasantly surprised when it worked, so I had a sturdier one made that my dog Ziggy loved!  He walked by my side and I never had to put any pressure on the new leash.” Like most inventors who develop their invention, Terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option.
That’s when she reached out to Lambert & Lambert to help her design and market her new invention, make presentations, and negotiate the license deal.  “Working with Lambert & Lambert has been a pleasure.  They are true professionals and I couldn’t have done it without them.”

My Investment Thesis on Fossil Group


                            Oct 01, 2016 by Jay Siva in  Ideas                        

Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL) is a vertically integrated (from design, all the way to point-of-sale) global consumer fashion accessories company that offers men’s and women’s fashion watches, jewelry, handbags, leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. The current valuation fails to account for the new opportunity that lies ahead of FOSL. Insiders and management own significant stakes, ensuring incentives are aligned. Camera shy CEO, Kosta N. Kartsotis, owns 13% of outstanding common stocks, and he earns no salary. The current share price offers investors the opportunity to buy a good business at a double-digit normalized free cash flow yield.

A new trend that arises from smart watches, strong currency headwind, increased marketing and advertisement related expenses (54% increase in last 5 years), and increased growth investments, led to margin compression, but the market fails to recognize the new expansion into the growth markets like China and new product development, Smart watches. Based on my sleuthing, newly introduced 2nd generation smart watches (Q Wander & Q Marshal) are sold out in multiple locations. 1st generation watches are no longer available in Fossil stores or online via Fossil’s website. I have received good reviews from sales people. They either have the 2nd generation watch or are planning to buy one in the near future. I believe that FOSL placed itself in a unique situation to capture the new trend: wearable devices that fit technology, fashion, and fitness altogether.
Although the current market price assumes that the revenue will continue to decline, I believe this is not the case for FOSL. Currently, the company trades for 7X 2015’s FCF. New long-term growth-related investments and liquidation of excess inventory compressed the margin and true cash flow potential. As these costs go away, margin will expand and so will the FCF. Historically, EBITDA margins float around ~20%. If the EBITDA margin goes to 18% FOSL will generate $7.28/Share, implying a 23% FCF yield.
The sleuth analyst:
FOSL is one of the highest shorted stocks, measured by short interest of float(36.37%). I have been visiting multiple Fossil store over the past two weeks. I believe wall street is wrong.
FOSL is selling lots of smart watches. I have talked to more than 15 sales associates at different locations. They all said the same story, good very positive story. Some stores even ran out of stocks. I have talked to customers those who wear them right now; they are happy with the generation-2 watches, especially about the battery life.
I also visited the same location multiple times in the past two weeks to talk to different sales people at the same location, and I didn’t find any inconsistencies among them.
https://www.fossil.com/us/en/products/q-wander-touchscreen-rose-gold-tone-stainless-smartwatchsku-ftw2112p.html
Rose gold is the most popular among them; some locations didn’t even have any stock.
Thesis:
Competitive Advantage/Industry Highlight:

Barriers to entry seem to be low in plain sight, but it is hard to break into the industry and run a profitable business operation. It is very difficult to grow one brand globally since it is required to have critical mass to have a successful operation.
A higher start-up cost with higher uncertainty doesn’t justify the huge initial investment. It is necessary to spend a huge amount of money on advertising to communicate the brand value. FOSL spends close to $250 million on advertisement every year. It is also necessary to create a brand image, even before you start selling through department stores or other channels. When the brand goes through distributors, the brand will not be able to communicate the image unless it has already been established. FOLS has enough brand names in its portfolio to expand its operation globally. FOSL’s licensing business is seven times larger than the closest competitor (MOV). It makes FOSL a natural partner for other brands. Guess even tried to join FOSL, but Callanen International (Guess watch maker) sued FOSL, claiming it violated the antitrust and unfair competition law. I don’t anticipate any risk that comes from one brand will leave from FOSL to another manufacturer.



The vertically integrated nature of Fossil’s business helps it to understand the new market trend and adapt itself quickly to new fashions/trends. It has seven weeks lead time while its closest competitor, Movado, has six months lead time. Fossil can even run some experimental products, which it normally does, before producing on a larger scale.
Unlike many of Fossil’s competitors, FOSL sells fashion watches along with luxury watches. Fashion watches tend to have shorter shelf/store time, indicated by the inventory days. Fashion watches are less sensitive to the economy as compared to luxury watches.



FOSL generates revenue through wholesale (~75%) and retail operations (~25%). The wholesale business comprises a large portion of EBIT. Having multi-brand watches at various price levels has a significant advantage when it comes to wholesale business. Since department stores are more concerned about how much money they could make per square foot when selling watches, they tend to carry all the watches at various price ranges to attract more customers of all levels.

Investment highlights:

FOSL is heavily shorted stock for a variety of reasons: I don’t believe that short sellers will continue to be right.

The threat from the smart watches: I think FOSL is well prepared to face the new trend. Their new wearable watches are a very hot product in the market. They are close enough to iWatch in terms of functionality, even though IOS has blocked certain features. Based on the communication that I had with sales associates, it will be rectified through 3rd party apps in the near future.
Margin compression: The market fails to recognize the growth investments, an increase in advertising and marketing expenses, and currency headwinds. I believe the margin will recover as the new investment starts to work out. FOSL is spending a huge amount of money on expanding its international business, as they tend to be high margin businesses rather than the businesses it has in the USA. Opening new stores tends to cost EBIT margin in the short run as indicated by the below graphs. I believe sell side analysts are more focused with margin than the possibility that comes in the near future. Most of the new stores in Asia are concession, and they don’t have fixed rent payments, but rather a % of revenue. I don’t believe this will have a negative effect, even if the market crashes.
“Our international margins are higher than our U.S. margins on the wholesale side, primarily due to the fact that we are afforded the luxury of selling at higher prices. We don’t have the same competitive landscape in the watch business in most of the markets internationally as we find here in the U.S., and therefore, the — we can price much more sharply. Our gross margin sort of generally anywhere from probably 5 to 10% higher in the international wholesale segment than they are in the U.S. segment on a like-per-like product perspective.” – Mike Kovar – Fossil, Inc. – CFO, 2008-Q2, CCT




FOSL’s new acquisition, Misfit, and the new licensing agreement with Kate Spade will open up new channels to market its products, wearable technology, through consumer electronic stores (CE). Misfit and Kate Spade already have self-spaces in multiple CEs, even though both of them don’t have good enough products to compete with Fitbit. Management is positive that it will change soon.
FOSL only generates 17% of its total sales from Asia; management believes that its recent investment will increase the sales volume in Asia where Swatch is a market leader.
FOSL has experienced management, and it has experience dealing with negative watch demand. In fact, the company still runs by one of the founders.
“ For fiscal 2014, Mr. Kartsotis, our CEO, continued to refuse all forms of compensation, expressing his belief that, given his level of stock ownership, his primary compensation is met by continuing to drive stock price growth, thereby aligning his interests with stockholders’ interests. As a result, the following references to Named Executive Officers in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis do not include Mr. Kartsotis. – Definitive Proxy, 2015”
Capitalization and Multiples: with very conservative assumption.



Valuation:

PUBLIC COMP
Trades at the lower end of the peer group. FOSL generates 25% of its revenue through Michael Kors brands and 75% comes from other brands. As such, I believe FOSL should trade above Michael Kors, or at the very least, it should trade on par with Michael Kors. If it does, FOSL would be worth $60 on a normalized earning basis. If it trades at the median, FOSL will be at $65.

EQUITY FAIR VALUE UNDER SELECTED VALUATION SCENARIOS


Assume the wholesale revenue drops by 20% (conservative &Base) 10% drop for aggressive case, for the sake of conservative valuation. Wholesale is the higher margin business. Retail sales Flat. It is reasonable to assume Wholesale EBIT margin is 24%; Retail margin is 13% based on historical data; EV/EBIT:8x based on peer valuation; EV/EBIT:10x based on historical trend (aggressive case).



DCF 


Implied Share price sensitivity Table: 

Implied upside from $30.35 sensitivity Table:

Conclusion:
Behind all the pessimism that arose from the margin compression and the new smart watch introduction from other companies, FOSL is trading at a very good valuation. Analysts are more obsessed with the margin compression and fail to look the possibilities that lie ahead in the future. I believe patient investors will eventually reap the benefits.









My Investment Thesis on Credit Acceptance

Feb 22, 2016
Investment Thesis

CACC is a defensive business with a very solid moat, good growth prospects, and great capital allocation. I don’t think the multiple reflects those qualities – the stock is undervalued
CACC trades at a low multiple despite delivering high growth and compounding capital at high rates

CACC trades at a ~9.1% forward earnings yield on an earnings stream that should grow at least in the mid-teens for the next 4-5 years
CACC has produced mid-teen ROICs for 20 years and continues to deliver returns in line with historical norms while operating in a near-trough pricing environment, suggesting upside to earnings


CACC will beat sell-side estimates for NTM earnings given trends in unit growth and pricing

They grew unit volumes 40% YoY in Q3 & 33% in Q4, but growth expectations are very modest: those volumes will translate to earnings above expectations for the next two years as CACC collects
CACC is also underwriting business profitably but is doing so at the low end of its historical rates of return, suggesting that current earnings are not representative of the business’s true earnings power


Potential Risks:

Concerns around CACC approaching full market penetration are overstated
There is regulatory risk, but the potential impact to profitability will likely be marginal, not existential


In a conservative base case, I think CACC should trade at ~$305 or ~50% above current value

In a bear case, I see limited downside given attractive entry multiple, defensiveness, and continued growth at above market rates: over the long term, CACC should outperform. But, if the auto cycle turns meaningfully negative, CACC could face temporary growth challenges or increased provisions



Valuation Methodology

In a conservative base case (key assumptions & drivers are below,) and a modest multiple for a business growing at least in the mid-teens, I arrive at a value of ~$305/sh.

I use 15x FY1 EPS – a premium to the current multiple but still cheap given per sh growth prospects
Given growth, defensiveness, and market position, I think a 10% discount rate is adequate




Key Metrics Summary

Business/Market Overview & Investment Rationale
Business & Market Overview

The auto finance market is large, fragmented, and for most companies, very competitive

Most lenders operate in a highly competitive landscape, bidding for business around clear market rates of return based on varying risk profiles
CACC is well positioned competitively vs. both subscale and established lenders




The market is also highly cyclical, but CACC has a long history of underwriting discipline

The auto loan industry has gone through multiple cycles, starting in the early 90s after CACC’s IPO
CACC has been affected by market cycles, but it has effectively priced its business throughout cycles

CACC can do this because they operate a unique lending model with limited competition





Key Investment Drivers

Dealer holdback is a profitable, differentiated model

CACC’s model aligns interest between the dealer and the lender, resulting in improved credit quality
Without real competition, CACC has pricing power, driving attractive ROAs & ROEs


CACC’s model is much more profitable than peers and requires less leverage

CACC has a consistent history of delivering attractive ROAs & ROEs but other lenders do not
Peers trade at bad multiples, reflecting the risk associated with their highly leveraged earnings stream, which I believe weighs on CACC’s multiple while CACC is very conservatively financed


With current spreads (CACC’s pricing on their loans) near historical lows, LTM earnings understate the true earnings power of the business

Spreads are below their historical norms suggesting CACC’s earnings power isn’t fully reflected in recent results
In addition, recent growth has been very positive, well above that of the past 3 years, which if it continues, would drive considerable earnings outperformance


CACC is highly cash generative & deploys capital effectively – driving superb results on a per share basis

FCF doesn’t reflect true cash generation capability because of high degrees of reinvestment
Aggressive buybacks (1/2 the shares since 2001) amplify already attractive ROEs and should continue to drive well above market EPS growth


Attractive reinvestment opportunities over the next 3-5 years: unclear how long the runway will be in the long term but outcomes skew positively

CACC has ample near-term runway to grow – it’s long-term runway will be an inverse function of credit availability in subprime
But given that the size of CACC’s TAM is inversely correlated to the profitability of low ROA, highly leveraged peers, I think outcomes skew positively over the long term


Regulatory risk is real, but the company is prepared, the product is valuable – the market appears to have overcorrected

CFPB focus will likely increase costs, not eliminate the business
CACC is well positioned relative to peers to deal with the potential of more stringent regulation




The Auto Finance Market is Large, Fragmented, And For Most Companies, Very Competitive

The market for US auto financing is huge (~$1 trillion dollars) and relatively fragmented, particularly in used car lending

~60% of auto loans are for used vehicles
~20% of total loans taken are subprime (<600 FICO) or deep subprime (<500 FICO)

The market for subprime and deep subprime are ~$160Bn and ~$36Bn, respectively (Q3 2015)




Credit Acceptance represents a very small portion of the market, providing <2% of total used auto loans and ~2% of the total loan volume for subprime and deep subprime



Most lenders operate in a highly competitive landscape, bidding for business around clear market rates of return based on varying risk profiles

Competitive risk-adjusted rates of return have pressured ROAs for CACC’s competition





CACC is well positioned competitively vs. both subscale and established lenders

As the regulatory landscape evolves, compliance costs will pressure the margins of smaller players, many of whom are in-house financing arms at dealerships (that don’t report to agencies)
In addition to regulatory pressure, rising rates will pressure NIMs for CACC’s established competitors, who have much lower ROAs, potentially increasing the demand for CACC’s loans




The Auto Finance Market is Highly Cyclical; However, CACC Has a Long History of Underwriting Discipline and Collections Execution

The auto loan industry has gone through multiple cycles, starting in the early 90s after CACC’s
 IPO and profitability attracted more capital to the space



And while CACC has been affected by market cycles, it has effectively anticipated its ability to collect on its loans

In the past 22 years, CACC has only overestimated collections by more than 2% on two occasions: 2001 and 2007 (reported collections of 95.6% and 96.2% of expectations, respectively)




Note: Before 2001, the maximum reported collection was 100%, so the average is understated.

Dealer Holdback is a Profitable, Differentiated Model

Most lenders underwrite by bidding against one another in competitive auctions; after underwriting, the dealer is removed from the equation. This is problematic because:

The dealer has no economic incentive to put the customer in a car he/she can afford
Traditional underwriting is very competitive, which results in subpar returns on assets

With low ROAs, lenders have to employ significant leverage to generate attractive ROEs, which in a cyclical industry, can be dangerous




CACC has a unique model that aligns its interests with dealers, reducing credit risk on its loans

CACC provides an advance on the amount financed (principal + interest) to the dealer, which covers the cost of sale and provides a small profit. CACC provides that advance in exchange for the right to collect a 20% servicing fee on the total collections balance
From the dealer’s perspective, there is an immediate profit, net of the vehicle expense, but most of the dealer’s return comes from the customer’s payments on their loan (called holdback)

The dealer is therefore highly incentivized to put the consumer in a car he/she can afford







CACC benefits from a significant incumbent bias and effectively no competition

CACC is in effect the lender of last resort – they step in for the portion of the population that traditional lenders fail to address. This is a very difficult position to disrupt
Because most of the dealer’s profit is based on a promise – that CACC will service the loan and make payments to the dealer – there is little incentive to move to an unproven player


As a lender of last resort, CACC has control over its pricing, which drives above-market IRRs and ROAs on a risk-adjusted basis

CACC is exposed to the auto cycle to some extent because the size & profitability of their underwriting universe is effectively the vacuum created by traditional lenders
Within that space, CACC has demonstrated the ability to underwrite profitably for ~30 years





CACC’s Model is More Profitable Than Peers and Requires Less Leverage

CACC has a consistent history of delivering attractive rates of return on both total capital and equity capital but other lenders do not

The competitive dynamics of the underwriting process have not been favorable to most lending companies, but CACC has underwritten profitably throughout the majority of its history
CACC is very conservatively financed with both 1) diverse funding sources spread out over various maturity durations and 2) significant excess borrowing capacity on many facilities





With subpar ROAs, competitors employ significant leverage to deliver favorable ROEs

I see the combination of leverage and cyclicality in the subprime market is dangerous for CACC’s competitors, which over time, should create opportunities for CACC





However, applying so much leverage to a space that has been highly cyclical puts those earnings at risk, which is reflected in the multiple

I believe the poor earnings quality of peers and the associated multiple weighs on CACC’s multiple
While most of CACC’s peers’ earnings are peaking and decelerating, CACC’s rates of profitability are neartrough and accelerating – I don’t think CACC’s premium multiple reflects that dynamic fully




With Current Spreads Near Historical Lows, LTM Earnings Understate the True Earnings Power of the Business

Spreads, which are a proxy for CACC’s IRR on a loan, are currently below their historical norm

Spreads have been somewhat volatile but typically trend within 3% of the mean
The spread (return) CACC can deliver on its capital is typically an inverse function of the ease of credit in subprime





At current spreads, a 400bps improvement in CACC’s incremental spreads (a return to the mean) would result in a 12% improvement in earnings power

Spreads have been somewhat volatile but typically trend within 3% of the mean
Operating leverage has put downward pressure on spreads (CACC can now write more business at lower rates to the same level of profitability,) but trends still suggest the business is under earning


In addition, recent trends demonstrate that growth is not slowing but accelerating, which provides visibility to further earnings upside


CACC is Highly Cash Generative & Deploys Capital Effectively – Driving Superb Results on a Per Share Basis

CACC has there uses for its cash flow, providing substantial flexibility in FCF deployment

1. Underwriting: Extending advances to dealers – the core business
2. Loan Purchases: Buying existing loans and servicing them (done when returns are attractive)
3. Buybacks: CACC evaluates all capital decisions vs. the expected return of buying back their stock


CACC’s FCF conversion appears weak, but only because so much capital is reinvested to grow the business: steady state FCF conversion would be close to 80%, implying ~30% FCF margins



These three uses of cash present different return opportunities depending on the market environment, and CACC has demonstrated the ability to effectively redeploy its FCF

CACC’s flexibility in FCF deployment is one of its most important competitive advantages


Capital allocation track record demonstrated in EPS growth and buybacks

CACC has bought back 50% of their stock since 2001




Attractive Reinvestment Opportunities Over the Next 3-5 Years: Unclear How Long the Runway Will be in the Long Term but Outcomes Skew Positively

Given the size and fragmentation of the industry, CACC still has growth ahead of it at <2% market share for used car loans

The market for subprime and deep subprime finance (below 600 FICO score) is currently ~$200Bn or 50x of CACC’s current book of business (~$4Bn)

From this perspective CACC’s runway seems very, very long
A snapshot of the 2013 subprime ABS market demonstrates how small a share of total volumes CACC represents and how important the continued profitability of Santander, Ally, and other highly leveraged peers is to shaping CACC’s market opportunity







But eventually, the pace at which CACC adds dealers will decline as they approach full market penetration; however, there is ample runway in the near term from this perspective

The number of dealers matters because it is through the dealers that CACC distributes their product
CACC currently has ~8mm dealers on their network; that is out of a total market of dealers of ~55k
Mgmt points to 55k as their TAM, but the real number is probably closer to 30-50% of that, proportional to the nonprime & subprime market

That suggests CACC can only double the dealer base 1-2x, assuming attrition – more than enough runway for the next few years




Offsetting the eventual trend in slowing active dealer growth, growth in volume/active dealer should improve over time

These volumes should grow above the market for used vehicles, driving topline growth
Volume/active dealer is highest in markets where CACC has operated the longest, demonstrating the value of the product and accelerating utilization over time


The full market penetration is a moving target because the size of CACC’s addressable market will fluctuate with the credit environment

Given that CACC’s value proposition of guaranteed credit approval, the size of their market will grow in periods of contracting credit




Regulatory Risk is Real, but the Company is Prepared & the Product, Valuable

CFPB focus will likely increase costs, not eliminate the business

This is a high value product – people need cars in America, and, in addition, CACC is one of the few lenders who offer deep subprime borrowers the opportunity to rebuild their credit

I see the CFPB closing access to subprime auto financing as unlikely in a nation where you literally cannot live without a car in many geographies


The criteria for aggressive lending that have been previously scrutinized center around uncollateralized, rollover installment loans – not straight-forward, asset backed finance


Equifax, an unbiased but influential industry player, recently articulated the importance of subprime lending in a study on the industry

They also note the dangers of potentially restricting the current industry, which could result in less reliable (and potentially dangerous) sources of credit for consumers in need





Regulation, therefore, will likely influence CACC’s cost structure more than its model but robust compliance is already a part of the business

Having operated in nation-wide collections for years – and collections is a very regulatory-intensive industry – CACC has significant experience in working constructively with regulators
Paired with their scale and anticipation of more scrutiny, their model should prove durable to change


CACC is well positioned relative to peers to deal with the potential of more stringent regulation

If the space were regulated, ROEs for CACC could be pressured, but regulation would push lower ROA lenders out of business.

CACC is the only operator who could potentially sacrifice profitability for volume (although they haven’t before), and are therefore the most resilient to regulatory change
Small dealers that offer in-house financing or other small lenders (who collectively represent a considerable portion of the subprime market) do not report to the credit bureaus and would be more likely targets of regulation




Increased regulatory scrutiny could actually benefit CACC by impairing margins for subscale or lower ROA competition, forcing those firms to withdraw products, increasing CACC’s TAM


Appendix
Dealer Interviews: Key Takeaways
Background: These are notes from my conversations with dealers following my write-up, which was based on public information and conversations with CACC IR. I had ~25 conversations in total, and ~15 of them were very substantive, meaning I had the opportunity to ask all of my questions.
Confirmed Assumptions

(+/-) MARKET IS VERY COMPETITIVE FOR LOANS: Choosing a lender is a very economic decision. Dealers have tons of options. Dealers need CACC when they can’t get financing done through typical providers

For most lenders the process is hyper competitive – some have 20+ financing partners
Dealers think very hard about the value proposition of their financing partners


(+) BUT WITH THE HOLDBACK, BRAND/TRUST MATTER & CACC DOMINATES: CACC is a very good operator and their brand is valuable. The importance of trust, speed of execution, and collections reliability really matters when using the holdback approach (dealers won’t get paid for 1-2 YEARS later, so the promise from CACC is important)

CACC has a significant advantage in the holdback market in brand value and pricing
Trust, speed of payment, and pricing. On brand value, CACC appears to be the most trusted name, with
Westlake coming in second, then a new company called Go in 3rd
CACC pays the fastest and offers the best pricing for depending on inventory
Generational bias towards CACC (old dealers love them) – this may be a long-term risk



New Insights

(+) STICKYNESS: CACC’s program model has significant influence on a dealership and improves retention: there is a training program and a buying protocol
(+/-) PROFITABLE IN ANY MARKET: In any market, the CACC program is profitable, but in very loose credit markets, some dealers think they have a better return on time by working with full credit providers (SC, Ally, WFC, etc.) because they can sell vehicle at higher margins
(+/-) INVENTORY & COLLATERAL VALUE: A key issue I was unaware of is the importance of appropriate inventory: CACC requires that the dealers buy vehicles below average book value to ensure collateral value (and minimize their credit risk). Matching your inventory to CACC’s program (cheap, US sedans) is essential: this results in a safer transaction for all parties and ensures the customer gets value in his/her purchase.

The dealer needs reliable cars, quality vehicles, bought below book (because CACC won’t extend an advance much in excess of book value) to ensure they’ll last the life of the loan
In addition to the incentive alignment, the experience is very controlled and ALL PARTIES reduce their risk as much as possible, including the customer
CACC creates margin of safety for the collateral value by controlling the buying habits of its dealers: this is unique and reduces CACC’s downside risk materially

CACC determines the type of inventory, the price you buy, and the price you sell


This model can be limited if you operate in an SUV market, where prices are higher


(+/-) NEED FOR HIGH VOLUME: If you are not doing a lot of volume, it’s not worth the effort to participate because CACC sales are lower margin than fully financed auto sales. This can lead to dealer attrition, particularly for marginal dealers, if volumes can’t meet the fixed costs of working with CACC. Smaller dealers have a preference for Westlake or Go.

What Concerns Me About CafePress

Feb 23, 2016
We sold half of our position in CafePress.  The reason for this is we are concerned management may not be able to successfully grow the business and because of that reduced visibility, it should be a smaller percentage of the fund.  In the most recent quarter CafePress reported its revenues decreased 30 percent compared to the prior year.  We expected revenues to decline when management stopped using unprofitable promotions and discounts to spur demand but the decrease was greater than we anticipated.
If you recall, the co-founders of CafePress returned in 2014 to turn around the business, planning to first stabilize the business, second optimize it, and third grow the business.  So far the co-founders have been able to stabilize and simplify the business by cutting over 200 product types, leaving CafePress with its 400 best-performing products.  This has resulted in improved gross margins of 40 percent, simplified operations, and improved free cash flows (free cash flow burn rate in the most recent third quarter was $0.8 million compared to $4.9 million in the previous year).  The co-founders are now focused on the second stage of the turnaround which is the optimization phase which can be best described as the phase where the infrastructure is built to grow the business.  For example, CafePress is making investments in engineering and human resources.  Although we appreciate the fact that the co-founders are reinvesting in order to grow, we are less enthusiastic about the fact that they are hiring new leaders from outside the business, which we believe increases risk.
We also believe its primary competitor Zazzle has a better website and better products and have been unimpressed so far with the changes made to the CafePress website and product offerings.  All these factors mean that we find ourselves in the position of not being able to forecast what this business will look like in the next five years which means it should represent a smaller percentage of the fund.
Although reduced, CafePress still represents 5 percent of our fund as of the end of the year.  One of the main reasons we have not reduced our position further is that most of our purchases were made in February of 2015 and we are waiting until February 2016 in order to classify our taxable gains as long-term.  In the interim we believe our downside is protected from the $2.60 per share in cash on the balance sheet as of the end of the third quarter (stock price at end of year is $3.84 per share).

Strayer Education: A Mistake?

Feb 23, 2016
We reduced our holding in Strayer Education from 14.1 percent of the portfolio at the end of the third quarter to 5 percent at the end of the year.  We believe Strayer has lower growth prospects and as a result trades at a fair valuation.  It therefore represented too high a percentage of the portfolio at 14.1 percent.  We believe it is more prudent to remain on the sidelines and wait to see if growth begins to materialize before committing a larger percentage of our portfolio to this position.
We also do not see any short-term catalysts on the horizon. We examined job growth prospects in the markets where Strayer’s students are located such as Washington, D.C. and Virginia, and saw no dramatic near term job growth that would drive prospective student enrollment within the most common degree plans at Strayer.
We have also become increasingly concerned that the employee culture is exhibiting signs of decline as the leadership continues to emphasize cutting costs instead of growing the business.  This is placing pressure on existing employees as many are being asked to take on more work.  For example, full-time faculty members are being asked to teach more classes.  Also, many support positions have been eliminated which we believe may have an effect on service quality.  We believe layoffs can profoundly affect the culture of the business, spreading fear among the remaining employees in the organization.  This fear causes companies to contract rather than expand.
Is Strayer a mistake?
As many of you know I have been a champion of Strayer for many years, writing at length in past quarterly letters about the strength of the investment.   My investment thesis was based on the fact that Strayer was the best run for-profit education institution and it avoided the bad practices of other for-profit colleges, such as recruiting students with false promises and loading them up with debt they could not pay back.  I felt many of Strayer’s problems were industry related and that its stock price would recover as investors discovered Strayer did not engage in the same practices as other for-profit schools.
Then employment growth in the United States began to decline and this along with other factors caused new student enrollments to decline by double digits.  This had the effect of shrinking Strayer’s total enrollment from 60,000 students at the end of 2010 to 42,200 students as of the most recent quarter. I had underestimated how quickly enrollments would decline but did not want to react too quickly to the negative news and sell the position. As new student enrollment stabilized in the last year, this gave me further confidence to continue holding our position.  We also gave Strayer credit for proactively seeking new avenues of growth such as their deal with Fiat Chrysler and the new Jack Welch Executive MBA program.  Fiat Chrysler is paying 100 percent of the tuition for dealership employees and Jack Welch Executive MBA enrollments are growing at a double digit rate, both creating more value.  In other words, we thought that their positive steps were balancing the stagnant enrollment environment.
I believe in some respects this investment has been a mistake.  First, I succumbed to the dreaded enemy of all investors – the confirmation bias.  This is the bias which causes investors to stick to their existing beliefs.  I found myself in a position where I was defending this investment, instead of making a detached evaluation.   As we invested in higher quality faster growing businesses my comparisons changed and therefore our decision to reduce our position became clearer.
I continue to have some conviction in Strayer but believe the negative attributes may outweigh the positive attributes.  This is why I reduced the position size.  Strayer continues to trade at a double digit free cash flow yield and has an even stronger balance sheet now that it has repaid all of its debt which protects our downside.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
