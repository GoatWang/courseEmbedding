microRNA Explained[edit]
MicroRNAs are small naturally occurring RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead have evolved to regulate gene expression.[2][3]
anti-miR Therapeutics[edit]
Anti-miR therapeutics inhibit specific microRNA targets. Animal models showed that modulating microRNAs through anti-miRs effectively regulates biological processes and provides therapeutic benefit to cardiac dysfunction, cancer and hepatitis C virus infection. Administration of anti-miR oligonucleotides is possible through local or parenteral injection.[4] The company's lead drug candidate, RG-012, is intended as a treatment for Alport Symdrome in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Strategic Alliances[edit]
In April 2008, Regulus and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a microRNA-focused strategic alliance for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2010, Regulus and GSK announced a new collaboration to develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics targeting microRNA-122 (miR-122) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Most recently, multi-national pharmaceutical giant Sanofi –Aventis awarded Regulus with the largest microRNA partnership to date – targeting fibrosis.[2]
Research Collaborations[edit]
Regulus has active collaborations with leading academic researchers from over 30 academic research laboratories globally.[1]
Patents[edit]
Regulus has more than 900 patents and patent applications, 600 of which cover the method of use, chemical modification and administration of oligonucleotides to address specific targets.[5]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

microRNA Explained[edit]
MicroRNAs are small naturally occurring RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead have evolved to regulate gene expression.[2][3]
anti-miR Therapeutics[edit]
Anti-miR therapeutics inhibit specific microRNA targets. Animal models showed that modulating microRNAs through anti-miRs effectively regulates biological processes and provides therapeutic benefit to cardiac dysfunction, cancer and hepatitis C virus infection. Administration of anti-miR oligonucleotides is possible through local or parenteral injection.[4] The company's lead drug candidate, RG-012, is intended as a treatment for Alport Symdrome in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Strategic Alliances[edit]
In April 2008, Regulus and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a microRNA-focused strategic alliance for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2010, Regulus and GSK announced a new collaboration to develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics targeting microRNA-122 (miR-122) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Most recently, multi-national pharmaceutical giant Sanofi –Aventis awarded Regulus with the largest microRNA partnership to date – targeting fibrosis.[2]
Research Collaborations[edit]
Regulus has active collaborations with leading academic researchers from over 30 academic research laboratories globally.[1]
Patents[edit]
Regulus has more than 900 patents and patent applications, 600 of which cover the method of use, chemical modification and administration of oligonucleotides to address specific targets.[5]

microRNA Explained[edit]
MicroRNAs are small naturally occurring RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead have evolved to regulate gene expression.[2][3]
anti-miR Therapeutics[edit]
Anti-miR therapeutics inhibit specific microRNA targets. Animal models showed that modulating microRNAs through anti-miRs effectively regulates biological processes and provides therapeutic benefit to cardiac dysfunction, cancer and hepatitis C virus infection. Administration of anti-miR oligonucleotides is possible through local or parenteral injection.[4] The company's lead drug candidate, RG-012, is intended as a treatment for Alport Symdrome in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Strategic Alliances[edit]
In April 2008, Regulus and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a microRNA-focused strategic alliance for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2010, Regulus and GSK announced a new collaboration to develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics targeting microRNA-122 (miR-122) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Most recently, multi-national pharmaceutical giant Sanofi –Aventis awarded Regulus with the largest microRNA partnership to date – targeting fibrosis.[2]
Research Collaborations[edit]
Regulus has active collaborations with leading academic researchers from over 30 academic research laboratories globally.[1]
Patents[edit]
Regulus has more than 900 patents and patent applications, 600 of which cover the method of use, chemical modification and administration of oligonucleotides to address specific targets.[5]

microRNA Explained[edit]
MicroRNAs are small naturally occurring RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead have evolved to regulate gene expression.[2][3]
anti-miR Therapeutics[edit]
Anti-miR therapeutics inhibit specific microRNA targets. Animal models showed that modulating microRNAs through anti-miRs effectively regulates biological processes and provides therapeutic benefit to cardiac dysfunction, cancer and hepatitis C virus infection. Administration of anti-miR oligonucleotides is possible through local or parenteral injection.[4] The company's lead drug candidate, RG-012, is intended as a treatment for Alport Symdrome in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Strategic Alliances[edit]
In April 2008, Regulus and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) entered into a microRNA-focused strategic alliance for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2010, Regulus and GSK announced a new collaboration to develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics targeting microRNA-122 (miR-122) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Most recently, multi-national pharmaceutical giant Sanofi –Aventis awarded Regulus with the largest microRNA partnership to date – targeting fibrosis.[2]
Research Collaborations[edit]
Regulus has active collaborations with leading academic researchers from over 30 academic research laboratories globally.[1]
Patents[edit]
Regulus has more than 900 patents and patent applications, 600 of which cover the method of use, chemical modification and administration of oligonucleotides to address specific targets.[5]

About 

TOGETHER… the Regulus team is leading the way in the discovery and development of microRNA therapeutics.
Dysregulated microRNA expression is a key factor in many complex multi-factoral diseases, including inflammatory disease, fibrosis, metabolic disease and cancer. microRNA therapeutics are oligonucleotides that modulate the function of microRNAs, correcting the imbalance of gene expression and associated cellular pathways to treat a broad range human disease.
microRNAs are members of a large class of non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that regulate most genes in the genome. A single microRNA can target and regulate up to hundreds of genes, each of which is involved in biological networks or pathways.
Regulus was formed in September 2007 by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALNY) and Isis Pharmaceuticals, now Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) and has continued to build upon its thought leadership, knowledge base, and intellectual property to become the leader in microRNA therapeutics.
Regulus Therapeutics is located in La Jolla, California and is led by a seasoned executive team and board of directors, with proven expertise in corporate management, business operations, drug discovery and development. Regulus’ scientific advisory board consists of world-class scientists and several of the foremost authorities in the field of microRNA research.
Together, we are confident that we have assembled the assets, strategic partners, scientific talent and corporate team to maintain our research, intellectual property and thought leadership in the creation of novel, first-in-class medicines through microRNA science.
TOGETHER WE…

	ITEM 14.
	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.





	The Registrant is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Section 145 of the
	Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a Delaware corporation may indemnify any persons who were, are, or are threatened to be made, parties to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
	administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of such corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer, director, employee or agent of such corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
	corporation as an officer, director, employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
	such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, provided that such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the corporations best interests and, with respect to any
	criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was illegal. A Delaware corporation may indemnify any persons who were, are, or are threatened to be made, a party to any threatened, pending or completed
	action or suit by or in the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such corporation as a director, officer,
	employee or agent of another corporation or enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit provided
	such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the corporations best interests except that no indemnification is permitted without judicial approval if the officer or director is
	adjudged to be liable to the corporation. Where an officer or director is successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense of any action referred to above, the corporation must indemnify him or her against the expenses (including attorneys
	fees) actually and reasonably incurred.




	 



	 



	 





	II-1









	Part II






	Information not required in prospectus




	 



	 




	The Registrants amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
	amended and restated bylaws, each of which will become effective upon the closing of this offering, provide for the indemnification of its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law.




	Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director of
	the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duties as a director, except for liability for any:



	 







	Ø






	 





	transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit;






	 







	Ø






	 





	act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;






	 







	Ø






	 





	unlawful payment of dividends or redemption of shares; or






	 







	Ø






	 





	breach of a directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders.







	The Registrants amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes such a provision. Expenses incurred by any officer or director in
	defending any such action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition shall be paid by the Registrant upon delivery to it of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
	ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Registrant.




	Section 174 of the Delaware
	General Corporation Law provides, among other things, that a director who willfully or negligently approves of an unlawful payment of dividends or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption, may be held liable for such actions. A director who was
	either absent when the unlawful actions were approved or dissented at the time may avoid liability by causing his or her dissent to such actions to be entered in the books containing minutes of the meetings of the board of directors at the time such
	action occurred or immediately after such absent director receives notice of the unlawful acts.




	As permitted by the Delaware General
	Corporation Law, the Registrant intends to enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers, that require the Registrant to indemnify such persons for certain expenses (including attorneys,
	witness or other professional fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such persons in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (including derivative actions), whether actual or threatened, to which any such person may be made a party by
	reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer or is or was acting or serving as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Registrant or any of its affiliated enterprises. Under these agreements, the Registrant is not
	required to provided indemnification for certain matters, including:



	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification beyond that permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law;






	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification for any proceeding with respect to the unlawful payment of remuneration to the director or officer;






	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification for certain proceedings involving a final judgment that the director or officer is required to disgorge profits from the purchase or
	sale of the Registrants stock






	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification for proceedings involving a final judgment that the directors or officers conduct was in bad faith, knowingly fraudulent or
	deliberately dishonest or constituted willful misconduct or a breach of his or her duty of loyalty, but only to the extent of such specific determination;







	 



	 



	 





	II-2









	Part II






	Information not required in prospectus




	 



	 



	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification for proceedings or claims brought by an officer or director against us or any of the Registrants directors, officers, employees
	or agents, except for claims to establish a right of indemnification or proceedings or claims approved by the Registrants board of directors or required by law;






	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification for settlements the director or officer enters into without the Registrants consent; or






	 







	Ø






	 





	indemnification in violation of any undertaking required by the Securities Act or in any registration statement filed by the Registrant.







	The indemnification agreements also set forth certain procedures that will apply in the event of a claim for
	indemnification thereunder.




	Except as otherwise disclosed under the heading BusinessLegal Proceedings in this registration
	statement, there is at present no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of the Registrants directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and the Registrant is not aware of any threatened
	litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.




	The Registrant has an insurance policy in place that covers its
	officers and directors with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or otherwise.




	The Registrant plans to enter into an underwriting agreement which provides that the underwriters are obligated, under some circumstances, to indemnify the Registrants directors, officers and
	controlling persons against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.








	ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED
	SECURITIES.





	The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities sold by the Registrant since January 1, 2009:



	 





	(1)




	 




	In January 2009, in connection with the conversion of Regulus Therapeutics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, into Regulus Therapeutics Inc., we issued an
	aggregate of 14,900,000 shares of series A convertible preferred stock to two accredited investors, in exchange for the membership interests such investors held in Regulus Therapeutics LLC immediately prior to such conversion. Upon completion of
	this offering, these shares will convert into 7,450,000 shares of common stock.





	 





	(2)




	 




	In March 2009, in connection with our series A convertible preferred stock financing, we issued and sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of series A convertible
	preferred stock to two accredited investors at a purchase price of $2.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million. Upon completion of this offering, these shares will convert into 5,000,000 shares of common stock.





	 





	(3)




	 




	In October 2010, in connection with our series B convertible preferred stock financing, we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,499,999 shares of series B convertible
	preferred stock to one accredited investor at a purchase price of $4.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million. Upon completion of this offering, these shares will convert into 1,249,999 shares of common stock.





	 





	(4)




	 





	In July 2012, we issued two convertible notes in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million each with a maturity date of February 25, 2013. These
	notes amend, restate and supersede notes originally issued in April 2008 and February 2010. The principal amount plus accrued interest under

	Part II






	Information not required in prospectus




	 



	 






	 





	the note originally issued in April 2008 will, upon the completion of our initial public offering in which we receive a minimum level of proceeds from new investors or that results in certain of
	our current stockholders together owning less than 50% of our voting securities, automatically convert into shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price. The principal amount plus accrued interest under the note originally issued
	in February 2010 will, upon the completion of our initial public offering in which we receive a minimum level of proceeds from new investors or that results in certain of our current stockholders together owning less than 50% of our voting
	securities, become convertible at the election of GSK into shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price for a period of three years following such initial public offering.






	 





	(5)




	 




	In August 2012, we issued a convertible note in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million with a maturity date of February 15, 2013. The principal plus accrued
	interest under the note will, upon the completion of our initial public offering in which we receive a minimum level of proceeds or that results in all of our outstanding preferred stock converting into our common stock, automatically convert into
	shares of our common stock at the initial public offering price.





	 





	(6)




	 




	From January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2012, we granted stock options under our 2009 equity incentive plan to purchase 3,620,149 shares of common stock (net of
	expirations, exercises and cancellations) to our employees, directors and consultants, having exercise prices ranging from $0.38 to $2.66 per share. In addition, options to purchase 243,394 shares of common stock have been exercised through

	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the Underwriting Agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as
	required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.




	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
	Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for




	 



	 



	 





	II-7









	Part II






	Information not required in prospectus




	 



	 




	indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful
	defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
	controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.




	The Registrant hereby undertakes that:



	 





	 




	(a)




	 




	For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in
	reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared
	effective.





	 





	 




	(b)




	 




	For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new
	registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

	ARTICLE 2






	GOVERNANCE OF THE COLLABORATION






	2.1 The Joint Steering
	Committee

	.





	2.1.1 


	Generally

	. Promptly, and in any event within [...***...] days, after the
	Effective Date, the Parties shall establish and convene a committee (the 

	Joint Steering Committee

	 or 

	JSC

	) as more fully described in this Section 2.1. The JSC shall have review and oversight
	responsibilities, including the responsibilities set forth in Section 2.1.6 below, for all Development activities performed by the Parties under the Initial Research Plan, the Research Plans and, if applicable, the Early Development Plans
	during the Collaboration Term. After the exercise by GSK of a Program Option for a Program, the JSC shall remain in place solely to serve as a vehicle to facilitate the communication of information between the Parties with respect to any
	subsequent Development activities by GSK with respect to the Option Compounds and related Licensed Products Developed under such Program and, once Commercialization is underway with respect to such Program (as measured by the Regulatory Approval, in
	any country of the world, of a Licensed Product with respect to such Program), GSK will keep




	 




	27




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Regulus informed of activities through an annual progress report and the JSC shall no longer be required to meet with respect to such Program. Each Party agrees to keep the JSC informed of
	the progress of the Development and/or Commercialization activities for which such Party is responsible hereunder with respect to each Program.





	2.1.2 


	Regulus Right to Discontinue Participation

	. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time following the end of the Program Term with respect
	to a Program hereunder, Regulus shall have the right, upon written notice to GSK, to discontinue its participation in the Joint Steering Committee or any Subcommittee thereof with respect to such Program, and such discontinuation by Regulus shall
	not constitute a breach of Regulus obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the exercise by Regulus of its right to discontinue its participation in the JSC pursuant to this Section 2.1.2 will not relieve Regulus of the
	obligation to perform any of its activities under any Program hereunder, and GSK shall have the right in such event to make decisions on matters where the JSC would have had such right and authority with respect to such Program, as necessary in
	order to continue such Programs. For clarity, in the event that Regulus obtains rights to Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products or Returned Licensed Products hereunder, Regulus shall have the right in such event to make decisions on
	all matters related to the Development, Manufacture and/or Commercialization of such Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products or Returned Licensed Products.





	2.1.3 


	Membership

	. The JSC shall be comprised of [...***...] representatives (or such other number of representatives as the Parties may agree) from each of GSK and
	Regulus. Each Party shall provide the other with a list of its initial members of the JSC on the Effective Date. Each Party may replace any or all of its representatives on the JSC at any time upon written notice to the other Party in
	accordance with Section 13.6 of this Agreement. Each representative of each Party shall be of the seniority and have expertise (either individually or collectively) in business and pharmaceutical drug discovery and development appropriate
	for service on the JSC in light of the functions, responsibilities and authority of the JSC and the status of Development of the Collaboration Compounds and related Licensed Products. Any member of the JSC may designate a substitute to attend
	and perform the functions of that member at any meeting of the JSC. Each member of the JSC, and any such substitute, shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations of Article 9. Each Party may, in its reasonable discretion,
	invite non-member representatives of such Party to attend meetings of the JSC as a non-voting participant, subject to the confidentiality obligations of Article 9. The Parties shall designate a chairperson (each, a
	

	Chairperson

	) to oversee the operation of the JSC, each such




	 




	28




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Chairperson to serve a twelve (12) month term. The right to name the Chairperson shall alternate between the Parties, with [...***...] designating the first such Chairperson.





	2.1.4 


	Meetings

	. During the Collaboration Term (subject to Section 2.1.2), the JSC shall meet in person or
	otherwise once each Calendar Quarter, and less or more frequently as the Parties mutually deem appropriate, on such dates, and at such places and times, as provided herein or as the Parties shall agree. Upon the conclusion of the Collaboration
	Term (subject to Section 2.1.2), the JSC shall meet, in person or otherwise, once every two (2) Calendar Quarters or more or less frequently as mutually agreed between the Parties, to provide Regulus an update regarding GSKs efforts
	after exercise of its Program Option(s) and otherwise to perform the responsibilities assigned to it under this Agreement while a Collaboration Compound is in Development;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	the Parties agree to
	periodically discuss in good faith the frequency and scope of such ongoing meetings and such JSC meetings will not occur once all Programs are in Commercialization (as measured by the Regulatory Approval, in any country of the world, of a Licensed
	Product with respect to each such Program). Meetings of the JSC that are held in person shall alternate between the offices of the Parties, or such other place as the Parties may agree. The members of the JSC also may convene or be polled
	or consulted from time to time by means of telecommunications, video conferences, electronic mail or correspondence, as deemed necessary or appropriate.





	2.1.5 


	Minutes

	. During the Collaboration Term (subject to Section 2.1.2), the Chairperson shall designate to the Alliance Manager of the other Party, responsibility for
	preparing and circulating minutes within [...***...] days after such meeting setting forth, a brief summary of the discussions at the meeting and a list of any actions, decisions or determinations approved by the JSC and a list of any issues to be
	resolved by the Executive Officers pursuant to Section 2.1.7. Such minutes shall be effective only after written approval of such minutes by both Parties. With the sole exception of specific items of the meeting minutes to which the
	members cannot agree and which are escalated to the Executive Officers as provided in Section 2.1.7 below, definitive minutes of all JSC meetings shall be finalized no later than [...***...] days after the meeting to which the minutes pertain.
	If at any time during the preparation and finalization of the JSC minutes, the Parties do not agree on any issue with respect to the minutes, such issue shall be resolved by the escalation process as provided in Section 2.1.7. The decision
	resulting from the escalation process shall be recorded by the designated Alliance Manager in amended finalized minutes for said meeting. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in no event shall such minutes be deemed to amend, or be
	incorporated into, the terms of this Agreement.

	that

	in no event shall the JSC have any authority to (x) resolve any
	disputes involving the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, (y) amend any budget or allocation of costs between the Parties, or require either Party to expend additional resources, whether internal or external, except as stated under

	agreement of the Executive Officers) to resolve such dispute by cooperating in good faith. Except as otherwise stated below in this Section 2.1.7, if the Parties still cannot agree on a matter after such escalation to the Executive
	Officers, the Parties will submit such matter to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13.1;

	provided

	under such Program. If Regulus disagrees with any such decisions taken by GSK, such disagreement will not be escalated to the Executive Officers nor shall any such disagreement be submitted
	to arbitration under Section 13.1 or any other form of review;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	GSK will comply with its diligence obligations (as described below in Article 4) and other relevant obligations as expressly stated
	hereunder (including payment obligations) and any dispute with respect to whether there has been a material breach by GSK of such obligation may be escalated to the Executive Officers and, if the Executive Officers are unable to resolve such dispute

	such matter shall be submitted to the JSC for resolution in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1.7(b).




	(b) For each Program, a Target Product Profile shall be prepared by GSK, in consultation with Regulus and through the JPS, for
	adoption by the Joint Steering Committee;

	provided

	,

	that

	each TPP shall (i) be consistent with and no broader than the Indication and Collaboration Targets for its corresponding Program, and (ii) set as the objective for the
	Program competitiveness in the applicable market, but not necessarily superiority in all aspects relevant to pharmaceutical commercialization. Upon nomination of a Development Candidate, each such aspirational TPP shall be updated, amended or
	modified to specifically address the particular qualities and features of such Development Candidate. In the event of a disagreement at the JSC level, GSK shall have the final decision-making authority on the content of the Target Product

	dispute within the Joint Patent Subcommittee, such matter shall be submitted to the JSC for resolution;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	appoint an individual (other than an existing member of the JSC) to act as the project leader for such Party (each, an 

	Alliance Manager

	). Each Alliance Manager shall thereafter be permitted to attend meetings of the JSC and
	any other Subcommittee as a nonvoting observer, subject to the confidentiality provisions of Article 9. The Alliance Managers shall be the primary point of contact for the Parties regarding the activities of the Parties contemplated by
	this Agreement during the Agreement Term and shall facilitate all such activities hereunder, including, but not limited to, communications between the Parties following any decisions made by the JSC, and the exchange of information between the

	ARTICLE 3






	THE CONDUCT OF THE COLLABORATION; REGULUS DILIGENCE






	3.1 Overview

	. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Regulus will be responsible for conducting
	four (4) Programs, each to be directed at a different Collaboration Target to be selected as set forth in Section 3.2 below, with the goal of researching, identifying and otherwise Developing [...***...] Collaboration Compounds under each
	Program through to [...***...], subject to earlier termination of such Program or the exercise of the [...***...] Option as described in this Agreement.





	3.2 Selection of Targets

	.





	3.2.1 


	Initial Collaboration
	Targets; Subsequent Collaboration Targets

	. As of the Effective Date, GSK has selected [...***...] Targets to be the subject of Programs to be progressed by Regulus under Section 3.3 (each such Target, an 

	Initial Collaboration
	Target

	), which [...***...] Initial Collaboration Targets are listed on

	Exhibit E

	hereto. GSK shall have the right to identify an additional [...***...] Targets (each, a 

	Subsequent Collaboration Target

	,
	and together with the Initial Collaboration Targets, the 

	Collaboration Targets

	) from the miRNA Pool within [...***...] months of identification of such miRNA Pool from within the miRNA Library in accordance with the Initial
	Research Plan (such [...***...] period, the 

	Target Selection Period

	 and the end of such [...***...] period being the 

	Final Target Selection Date

	);

	provided

	,

	further

	,

	that

	GSK may, at any
	time during the Target Selection Period, replace up to [...***...] previously-identified Collaboration Targets which have not reached [...***...] (each, a 

	Replaceable Target

	) with a different Target from the miRNA Pool, in which
	case, such different Target shall become a Collaboration Target and such previously-identified Collaboration Target (as such, a 

	Former Target

	) shall no longer be a Collaboration Target. For purposes of clarity,
	notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall GSK have the ability to replace more than [...***...] previously-identified Collaboration Targets under this Agreement, nor shall there be more than a total of four
	(4) Collaboration Targets as of the Final Target Selection Date. Any Target which is not a Collaboration Target as of the Final Target Selection Date shall thereafter be a Former Target.





	3.2.2 


	Selection to be Completed by Final Target Selection Date

	. After the selection of the Subsequent
	Collaboration Targets by GSK from the miRNA Pool, to be completed by the Final Target Selection Date, Regulus will progress Programs against such Subsequent Collaboration Targets in accordance with the Research Plan for each Program as set forth in
	Section 3.3. If any Subsequent Collaboration Target is not selected within the Target




	 




	35




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Selection Period, GSKs rights and Regulus obligations under the Agreement with respect to such Subsequent Collaboration Target and related Program shall terminate.





	3.2.3 


	Blocked Targets

	. Additionally, if during the Target Selection Period, Regulus intends to work outside of
	the Research Program, along with or for the benefit of an Affiliate, Parent Company or a Third Party, to identify, research, optimize, otherwise Develop or Commercialize any [...***...] prior to the selection by GSK of all four (4) final
	Collaboration Targets, then Regulus shall first offer in writing to GSK the right to select such miRNA as one of the remaining Collaboration Targets hereunder, including as a replacement for any Replaceable Target, in each case solely to the extent
	that GSK has the right to do so under Section 3.2.1 above (including the [...***...] limitation set forth therein), such right to expire [...***...] days after GSKs receipt of such written offer. If GSK does not select such miRNA as
	a Collaboration Target hereunder, such miRNA shall thereafter be excluded from the miRNA Pool and deemed a Blocked Target;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	no more than [...***...] of the number of miRNAs in the miRNA Pool may be deemed
	to be a Blocked Target under the Agreement.





	3.2.4 


	Expansion of Agreement

	. The Parties hereby agree
	that, on or about the date that is [...***...] years after the Effective Date as may be mutually agreed by the Parties, the Parties shall meet to discuss and consider in good faith the possible expansion of the Agreement to include additional
	Targets, on [...***...], but without any obligation on either Party to enter into any such expanded Agreement.





	3.3 Commencement of the Programs; Research Program; Research Plan

	.





	3.3.1 


	Commencement of Program

	. Commencing on the Effective Date, Regulus will progress Programs directed against
	the Initial Collaboration Targets in accordance with the Research Plan for each such Program. The Programs directed against the Subsequent Collaboration Targets shall each commence as soon as practicable after the selection of such Subsequent
	Collaboration Targets and the final JSC approval of the Research Plan with respect to such Program.





	3.3.2 


	Research Program

	. Subject to the oversight of the JSC and except as may be mutually agreed by the Parties,
	Regulus shall be solely responsible for conducting all Development activities set forth in the Research Plan with respect to Collaboration Compounds under each Research Program, and for all costs and expenses associated therewith, during the
	relevant Research Collaboration Term.





	3.3.3 


	Research Plan

	. Each Research Program will be carried out
	by Regulus pursuant to a Research Plan, which will outline (subject to JSC [...***...] and/or amendment as set

	(such date of receipt by GSK, the 

	[...***...] Report Date

	), specifying the Program for which the Program Option is being exercised. After providing to Regulus such written notice of its election to exercise the [...***...]
	Option, GSK shall, within [...***...] days of receipt of an invoice therefore from Regulus, pay the [...***...] Option Exercise Fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in GSKs sole discretion, it shall have the right to exercise a Program
	Option prior to the [...***...] Report Date but during the [...***...] Option Exercise Period by providing Regulus written notice thereof, in which case the Table 1 Rates will still apply to the milestone payments and royalties owed by GSK to
	Regulus hereunder.




	(c) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if, at any time during the Research Collaboration Term for
	a Research Program, the JSC (by mutual agreement) or GSK requests that Regulus begin a [...***...] of a Collaboration Compound under such Research Program prior to Regulus notification to GSK of a Collaboration Compound that meets the
	[...***...] Criteria, the [...***...] Criteria shall be deemed to have been met and, upon such request, the [...***...] Option Exercise Period shall begin.





	4.2.2 


	PoC Option.





	(a) If GSK does not exercise the
	[...***...] Option within the [...***...] Option Exercise Period, then, on a Program-by-Program basis, Regulus will continue to use Diligent Efforts to progress the Program through to the [...***...]. On a Program-by-Program basis, Regulus will
	notify GSK when it has completed a PoC Trial with respect to a Development Candidate, and shall provide to GSK, within [...***...] days of such occurrence (to be reasonably extended if impractical depending on the nature of the Clinical Studies,
	Pre-Clinical Studies and the other data generated thereunder), a reasonably complete data package containing all material analysis, results and clinical data or any related material correspondence or information received from or sent to any
	Regulatory Authority relating to the Development Candidate at issue (which data package need not include any information or data generated in the course of GSKs conduct of the PoC Trial, or portion thereof, under Section 3.5.5) (the
	

	[...***...] Report

	, and referred to collectively with the [...***...] Report as the 

	Reports

	), in each case as would be reasonably expected to be material to assist and enable GSK to make its decision on whether
	to elect to exercise its [...***...] with respect to the Program under which such Development Candidate is Developed. In addition, GSK shall have the right to review, to the extent practical and reasonable, the original records and documentation
	containing such material data, results and information.




	 




	48




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	(b) GSK may exercise its [...***...] with respect to a Program by delivering to
	Regulus a written notice of exercise, not later than [...***...] days (unless extended by the mutual written agreement of the Parties or as permitted herein pending HSR clearance by the FTC as set forth in Section 4.2.6) after the date of
	receipt by GSK from Regulus of the PoC Trial Report (such [...***...] -day period, as it may be extended, the 

	[...***...] Exercise Period

	), with respect to the applicable Development Candidate at issue (such date of receipt by
	GSK, the 

	[...***...] Date

	), specifying the Program for which the Program Option is being exercised, subject to the tolling of such payment obligation pursuant to Section 4.2.6. After providing to Regulus such written
	notice of its election to exercise the [...***...], GSK shall, within [...***...] days of receipt of an invoice therefore from Regulus, pay the [...***...] Exercise Fee as described in Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
	GSKs sole discretion, it shall have the right to exercise a Program Option prior to the [...***...] Date by providing Regulus written notice thereof.





	4.2.3 


	Terminated Program Option

	. Subject to GSKs obligation to pay milestones and royalties pursuant to Section 6.4, subject to Section 6.5.3,
	Section 6.6.1(d) and Section 6.6.2, GSK shall have the right to exercise its Terminated Program Option for a Program by providing Regulus written notice within an exercise period of [...***...] days (extendable to [...***...] days at
	GSKs request if made within such initial [...***...] day period) after the provision of a data package to GSK by Regulus (comparable to the [...***...] Report) for a terminated Program in accordance with GSKs Terminated Program Options
	as described under Section 4.1.1 (the 

	Terminated Program Option Report

	);

	provided

	,

	that

	GSKs obligation to pay Regulus milestones and royalties shall vary, as set forth in Section 6.4, subject to
	Section 6.5.3, Section 6.6.1(d) and Section 6.6.2, depending on the stage of Development at which the termination occurred.





	4.2.4 


	Program Option Upon Completion of the [...***...] where the Leading Compound is immediately terminated.

	If GSK exercises its Program Option in accordance with Section 4.2.2
	after Completion of the [...***...] for a Leading Compound under a Program but immediately terminates the Leading Compound in order to progress a Back-up Compound under the same Program (provided that GSK provides written notice to Regulus of such
	decision along with or within [...***...] Business Days of notice of GSKs exercise of its Program Option), then GSK shall pay Regulus the royalties and milestones in accordance with the applicable [...***...] provided, however, that, if GSK
	later undertakes the Development or Commercialization of such terminated Leading Compound, then GSK shall thereafter pay Regulus the applicable royalties and milestones in accordance with the [...***...] with respect to all Licensed Products under
	the relevant Program, except that, with respect to any Milestone Event which had already been achieved by a Back-up Compound under such Program for which GSK had already paid Regulus




	 




	49




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	the relevant milestone payment in accordance with the [...***...], then, as such terminated Leading Compound (or another Option Compound) achieves such Milestone Event, GSK shall pay to Regulus
	the difference between the [...***...] and the [...***...] with respect to such Milestone Event.





	4.2.5 


	Early
	Program Option Exercise.

	 For purposes of clarity, upon exercise of any Program Option by GSK hereunder, GSK shall pay Regulus the Program Option Exercise Fee applicable to the exercise of such Program Option (as applicable), in addition to
	any other milestones and royalties which may be due in the future as a result of the Development and/or Commercialization of the Option Compounds and related Licensed Products by GSK and/or its Affiliates and Sublicensees. Notwithstanding any
	of the foregoing, regardless of whether or not the Development activities or stages necessary to trigger a particular Program Option for a Program have been completed or achieved (

	e.g.

	, regardless of whether a Collaboration Compound Developed
	under a Program has qualified as a Development Candidate or has satisfied the [...***...] Criteria, or [...***...] has occurred for such Collaboration Compound), GSK shall have the right, at any time prior to the completion of such Development
	activities which might otherwise trigger a particular Program Option (but in no event after the end of the Option Period that would otherwise apply with respect to such Program Option), to exercise its Program Option early for such Program by paying
	Regulus (or its successors or assigns) the Program Option Exercise Fee in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.5.5 depending upon the time at which GSK exercises its Program Option and the remaining milestone and royalty obligations
	shall be payable in accordance with Section 6.5.5, Section 6.6.1(f) and Section 6.6.2, depending on the time that GSK exercises its Program Option.





	4.2.6 


	HSR; Option Period Extension

	. In the event that GSK reasonably determines in good faith that the exercise of any Program Option by GSK under this Agreement requires a filing
	with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, as applicable, (collectively, the 

	FTC

	) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (15 U.S.C. §18a) (

	HSR

	), or any
	successor thereto or under any similar premerger notification provision in the EU or other jurisdiction, GSK shall make such filing [...***...], and the Option Period applicable to such Program Option shall be extended automatically for [...***...]
	from the expiration of the original Option Period (the 

	Option Period Extension

	) in the event that: (a) the HSR initial waiting period is still pending upon expiration of the original Option Period; or (b) a Second
	Request that GSK intends to respond to is received from the FTC in connection with such filing and final clearance has not been granted upon expiration of the Option Period; provided, that if the HSR initial waiting period ends during the
	original Option Period, such Option Period shall be extended for no more than an additional [...***...] following the end of such HSR initial waiting period. During such Option Period Extension, all rights and




	 




	50




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	obligations of the respective Parties related to the exercise of such Program Option or to make any otherwise required Program Option Exercise Fee payment shall be tolled. In the event that
	HSR clearance has still not been granted upon expiration of the Option Period Extension, Regulus and GSK shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith whether an additional extension of the Option Period is reasonable, with the presumption being that
	the Option Period shall be extended for no more than an additional [...***...] period, unless there is no [...***...], in which case no such extension shall be granted.





	4.2.7 


	Refused Candidates. 

	If GSK does not exercise its Program Option for a Program when triggered within the applicable Option Period, as may be extended by Section 4.2.6 or
	by the mutual written agreement of the Parties, and GSK has not exercised its Program Option early pursuant to Section 4.2.5, and does not exercise any of its Terminated Program Options under Section 4.2.3, then such Program Option shall
	expire with respect to such Program and except if the expired Program Option is a [...***...] Option (in which event Section 4.2.2(a) shall apply), and then, except if GSK acquires exclusive license rights to the relevant Collaboration
	Compounds under the applicable termination provisions of Article 12, any Collaboration Compounds resulting from such Program shall be referred to as 

	Refused Candidates

	 and any Licensed Products having any such Refused
	Candidate(s) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) as 

	Refused Candidate Products

	 and GSK shall no longer have any rights with respect to such Refused Candidates and Refused Candidate Products. Regulus will
	thereafter have all rights as set forth in Section 12.1.5(c), itself or with a Third Party or through a Sublicensee and without regard to Article 7 (except to the extent set forth in Section 12.1.5(c)), to Develop, Manufacture and
	Commercialize the Refused Candidates and any Refused Candidate Products at Regulus sole expense, and Regulus shall no longer have any obligations with respect to such Refused Candidates and any Refused Candidate Products other than the Reverse
	Royalty payment obligation to GSK as set forth in Section 6.7 and Section 12.1.5(c). In addition, Regulus will take responsibility for all licensing costs and payments incurred by GSK after the date that such Collaboration Compounds
	became Refused Candidates or Refused Candidate Products and that are owed by GSK to Third Parties (excluding any costs that were already due as payable by GSK as of the date that such Collaboration Compounds became Refused Candidates or Refused
	Candidate Products) as a result of the practice of intellectual property licensed from any such Third Parties in the Development, Manufacture and/or Commercialization of Refused Candidates and Refused Candidate Products hereunder, including, without
	limitation, all upfront fees, annual payments, milestone payments and royalty payments to the extent allocable to such Refused Candidates and Refused Candidate Products. For clarity, any such costs and payments shall only include the share of such
	costs and payments




	 




	51




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	attributable to such Refused Candidates and Refused Candidate Products and not to any other compounds licensed by GSK. For purposes of clarity, upon reversion of such rights to Regulus with
	respect to any Refused Candidates or Refused Candidate Products hereunder, such Refused Candidates shall no longer be deemed Option Compounds and/or Collaboration Compounds and such Refused Candidate Products shall no longer be deemed Licensed
	Products, in each case to which GSK has any rights under this Agreement, except that, upon the exercise by GSK of any Terminated Program Option under Section 4.2.3 or early exercise of a Program Option under Section 4.2.5, this
	Section 4.2.7 shall not apply.





	4.2.8 


	Right to Exercise Program Options for Development Candidates after
	Expiration of the Research Collaboration Term

	. For clarity, it is understood and agreed by the Parties that, with respect to each Collaboration Target, GSKs rights to exercise its Program Option with respect to any Collaboration Compounds
	that are at the [...***...] Stage or later but have not yet completed or entered an Early Development Program at the time of expiration of the Research Collaboration Term, shall remain exercisable in accordance with this Article 4 until
	termination of the last to expire Option Period with respect to such Program, unless such Program is earlier terminated as provided hereunder.





	4.3 Activities Post-Option Exercise by GSK.






	4.3.1 


	Commencement of Activities

	. As soon as practicable after the exercise by GSK of a Program Option for a Program
	and receipt from Regulus of the information and materials set forth in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2, GSK shall promptly commence and pursue a program of ongoing Development and Commercialization for the Option Compounds under such Program, in accordance
	with GSKs diligence obligations set forth below. GSK shall be solely responsible for all Development and Commercialization activities, and for all [...***...] associated therewith, with respect to the Development, Manufacture and
	Commercialization of Option Compounds and related Licensed Products of a Program, following exercise of its Program Option for such Program.





	4.3.2 


	Returned Licensed Products

	. In the event that GSK exercises its Program Option for a Program and thereafter determines in good faith, for any reason, to cease the Development and
	Commercialization of all Option Compounds and related Licensed Products, on a Collaboration Target-by-Collaboration Target basis, or GSKs rights to such Option Compounds and related Licensed Products terminates for any reason other than as a
	result of the termination of this Agreement by GSK for Regulus uncured material breach under Section 12.2 or for Regulus insolvency under Section 12.6, or a termination by the JSC [...***...] for scientific or safety concerns
	pursuant to Section 12.5, then each Option Compound and related Licensed




	 




	52




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Product resulting from such Program shall thereafter be referred to as a 

	Returned Licensed Product

	, and GSK shall no longer have any rights with respect to such Returned
	Licensed Product, except for the right to receive Reverse Royalties under Section 6.7 (except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in Article 12). Regulus will thereafter have all rights as set forth in Section 12.7.1,
	12.7.2 or 12.7.4, as applicable, itself or with a Third Party or through a Sublicensee and without regard to Article 7, to Develop, Manufacture and Commercialize the Returned Licensed Products at Regulus sole expense, and Regulus shall
	have no obligations with respect to such Returned Licensed Products other than the Reverse Royalty payment obligation to GSK as set forth in Section 6.7 (except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in Article 12). In addition,
	Regulus will take responsibility for all licensing costs and payments incurred by GSK after the date that such Collaboration Compounds became Returned Licensed Products and that are owed by GSK to Third Parties (excluding any costs that were already
	due as payable by GSK as of the date that such Collaboration Compounds became Returned Licensed Products) as a result of the practice of intellectual property licensed from any such Third Party in the Development, Manufacture and/or
	Commercialization of Returned Licensed Products hereunder, including, without limitation, all upfront fees, annual payments, milestone payments and royalty payments to the extent allocable to such Returned Licensed Product. For clarity, any
	such costs and payments shall only include the share of such costs and payments which is attributable directly to such Returned Licensed Products and not to any other compounds licensed by GSK. For purposes of clarity, upon reversion of such
	rights to Regulus with respect to any Returned Licensed Products hereunder, such Returned Licensed Products shall no longer be deemed Option Compounds and/or Licensed Product to which GSK has any rights under this Agreement. For purposes of
	clarity, upon the exercise by GSK of any Terminated Program Option under Section 4.2.3, or the termination of a Program otherwise under Section 3.4.3 or the early exercise of a Program Option under Section 4.2.5, this
	Section 4.3.2 shall not apply.

	GSK Diligence

	. GSK shall exercise its Diligent Efforts in Developing and Commercializing at least one
	Licensed Product in the Field [...***...] for each Program for which GSK exercises the Program Option. For purposes of clarity, (a) GSK shall not be required to Develop and Commercialize, with respect to a Program, more than one Option
	Compound resulting from a Program,

	provided

	,

	that

	GSK exerts its Diligent Efforts to Develop and Commercialize at least one Option Compound resulting from such Program, and (b) following GSKs exercise of its Program
	Option for a Program, GSK may, in its sole discretion, substitute the Leading Compound with another Option Compound Developed in the same Program or Develop and Commercialize other Option Compounds resulting from such Program,

	with respect to a Program hereunder, to the extent that Regulus owns any trademark(s) which were used prior to the exercise of the Program Option by GSK that are specific to any Option Compound Developed under such Program and GSK reasonably
	believes such trademark(s) would be reasonably necessary or useful for the marketing and sale in the Field in the Territory of such Option Compound or related Licensed Products, Regulus shall, upon GSKs request [...***...], assign its
	rights and title to such trademark(s) to GSK reasonably in advance of the First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Products. Other than the trademarks described above which are owned by Regulus prior to the exercise of a Program Option by
	GSK, the Commercializing Party shall be solely responsible for developing, selecting, searching, registration and maintenance of, and shall be the exclusive owner of all trademark(s), trade dress, logos, slogans, designs, copyrights and domain names
	used on and/or in connection with any of the Option Compounds and Licensed Products resulting from a Program.

	The [...***...] Milestone Event shall occur upon [...***...] that the Discovery Milestone has been met.




	**For each of these milestones, GSK pays the Table 1 Rate or Table 2 Rate, as applicable, if GSK achieves the Milestone Event
	(i.e., if GSK had exercised its Program Option at [...***...] Stage or otherwise prior to [...***...]) or the Table 3 Rate if Regulus achieves the Milestone Event (i.e., if GSK had not so exercised its Program Option but Regulus continued developing
	the Collaboration Compound).




	***This milestone is only payable where GSK exercises the Program Option prior to [...***...]
	. This Milestone Event will be met as determined by GSK; provided, however, that the Milestone Event will be deemed to have been met if, after conducting a [...***...], GSK moves the relevant Program forward through clinical development by
	Initiating either a [...***...] with respect to such Program. In addition, if GSK has not [...***...] but has not terminated the Program and returned the Collaboration Compounds under such Program to Regulus as Returned Licensed Products, then
	this Milestone Event will be deemed to have been met.





	6.5 Limitations on Milestone Payments






	6.5.1 

	No milestone payments are owed for any Milestone Event that is not achieved and in the case where one Option Compound
	or Licensed Product is substituted for another, then the milestones payable with respect to the new Option Compound or Licensed Product are only for future Milestone Events.





	6.5.2 

	Each milestone will be paid only once per Program upon the first achievement of the Milestone Event, regardless of the number of Option Compounds or Licensed Products resulting under the
	Program, and regardless of whether any such Option Compound or Licensed Product constitutes a [...***...] product or any combination of the foregoing. The Discovery Milestone will be paid a maximum of four (4) times, once for each of the
	four (4) Programs, upon the first achievement of such Milestone Event for each Program, and will not be paid again for the Initial Collaboration Targets in the event that either or both such Initial Collaboration Targets are substituted with
	other Targets pursuant to Section 3.2.





	6.5.3 

	Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, upon GSKs exercise
	of a Terminated Program Option pursuant to Section 4.2.3:




	 




	62




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	(a) before the achievement of the [...***...], GSK shall pay Regulus milestones at

	(c) after
	[...***...] for such Program, but prior to the [...***...], then GSK shall pay Regulus milestones at [...***...] set forth above.





	6.5.4 

	If GSK exercises its Program Option after [...***...] by the Leading Compound under the Program but GSK immediately substitutes such Leading Compound by a Back-up Compound under such
	Program in accordance with Section 4.2.4, then GSK shall pay Regulus milestones at the [...***...] set forth above, except as set forth in Section 4.2.4.





	6.5.5 

	Upon GSKs exercise of a Program Option pursuant to Section 4.2.5:




	(a) before the achievement of [...***...], GSK shall pay Regulus milestones at the [...***...] set forth above;




	(b) after the achievement of [...***...] but prior to the [...***...] for such Program, then GSK shall pay Regulus milestones at the [...***...] Rates set forth above; and

	Parties shall negotiate in good faith the [...***...] upon achievement of which milestone payments would be payable with respect to such [...***...] product.





	6.6 Royalty Payments to Regulus.






	6.6.1 


	GSK Patent
	Royalty

	. As partial consideration for the rights granted to GSK hereunder, GSK will pay to Regulus royalties on Annual Net Sales of the Royalty-Bearing Products sold by GSK, its Affiliates or Sublicensees during a calendar year, on a
	country-by-country basis and Royalty-Bearing Product-by-Royalty-Bearing Product basis, in the countries of the Territory in which there is a Valid Claim within the Regulus Technology or Collaboration Technology (excluding GSK Collaboration

	Section 6.6.2, 6.8 and Article 12, with respect to sales of a Collaboration Compound or Licensed Product that has obtained Regulatory Approval as [...***...] to the same extent as would be payable with respect to Net Sales of a Licensed
	Product that has obtained Regulatory Approval for the treatment of [...***...] Indication hereunder, provided, that, in no event shall GSK be obligated to pay royalties more than once with respect to the same unit of such Collaboration Compound or
	Licensed Product, as applicable.

	(b) In the event any Combination Product(s) are sold, royalties on such Combination Products
	will be determined pursuant to Section 1.113.




	(c) The royalty rates in the table above are incremental rates,
	which apply only for the respective increment of Annual Net Sales described in the Annual Net Sales column. Thus, once a total Annual Net Sales figure is achieved for the year, the royalties owed on any lower tier portion of Annual Net Sales
	are not adjusted up to the higher tier rate.




	(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, upon GSKs exercise of a
	Terminated Program Option pursuant to Section 4.2.3:




	(i) before the achievement of [...***...], GSK shall pay
	Regulus royalties at [...***...] of the [...***...] set forth above;

	Program, but prior to the [...***...], then GSK shall pay Regulus royalties at the Table 2 Rates set forth above.




	(e) If GSK exercises its Program Option after [...***...] by the Leading Compound under the Program but GSK immediately substitutes
	such Leading Compound by a Back-up Compound under such Program in accordance with Section 4.2.4, then GSK shall pay Regulus royalties at the [...***...] set forth above, except as set forth in Section 4.2.4.




	(f) Upon GSKs exercise of a Program Option pursuant to Section 4.2.5:




	(i) before the achievement of the [...***...], GSK shall pay Regulus royalties at the [...***...] set forth above;

	at the [...***...] set forth above; and




	(iii) after [...***...] for such Program, but prior to the [...***...], then
	GSK shall pay Regulus royalties at the [...***...] set forth above.





	6.6.2 Application of Royalty
	Rates


	. 

	All royalties set forth under Section 6.6 shall always be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.6.2, and shall only be payable as follows, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis:




	(a) 

	Patent Royalty Term

	: GSKs obligation to pay the GSK Patent Royalty above with respect to a
	Licensed Product and/or Combination Product will continue on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis from the date of First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product or Combination Product until the date of [...***...]
	within the [...***...] of the Licensed Product;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	with respect to those cases where (i) the only Valid Claim is [...***...], or (ii) the only Valid Claim within the [...***...] of the Licensed
	Product or (B) a claim that covers the [...***...] of a miRNA Compound or a miRNA Therapeutic) (such claim in clauses (i) or (ii) [...***...] of a Licensed Product or Combination Product, the rates with respect to such Licensed Product or
	Combination Product shall be reduced by [...***...] of the applicable rates specified in Section 6.6.1.




	(b) 

	Pending Patents:

	If, on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, there is, at any time
	during the period within [...***...] years after the date of First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in such country, no Valid

	a claim which covers the [...***...] of the Licensed Product which has been pending for more [...***...] years but for less than [...***...] years from the filing date of such patent application (a 

	Pending Claim

	), then, during
	such time, not to extend beyond [...***...] years from the date of [...***...] of such Licensed Product in the relevant country, GSK will pay [...***...] of the otherwise applicable GSK Patent Royalty rates set forth in Section 6.6.1. In
	addition, where the only Pending Claim covering the Licensed Product would, if issued, be a [...***...], then the rates shall be reduced to be [...***...] of the otherwise applicable GSK Patent Royalty rates set forth in
	Section 6.6.1. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if the Pending Claim [...***...], then the applicable royalty rate will be, going forward from the time that such [...***...] and not retroactively, and GSK shall pay Regulus,
	[...***...] Royalty rates as set forth in the table in Section 6.6.1 above (subject to the [...***...] reduction if such Valid Claim qualifying under Section 1.196(a) resulting from the Pending Claim is a [...***...]) and for the
	duration stated under the Patent Royalty Term paragraph (a) above, but if the Pending Claim does not issue within [...***...] years of the date of filing of such patent application, then thereafter, GSK will no longer pay any
	royalty to Regulus with respect to such Pending Claim under this paragraph (b).




	(c) 

	Know-How Royalty

	: If,
	on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, (i) at any time during the period within [...***...] years after the date of First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in such country, the only Valid Claims or
	Pending Claims within the [...***...] in each case which cover the [...***...] of the Licensed Product, are claims that cover [...***...] a miRNA Compound or a miRNA Therapeutic, or (ii) there [...***...], at any time during the period within
	[...***...] years after the date of First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in such country, Valid Claims or Pending Claims within the [...***...] in each case which covered the [...***...]of the Licensed Product, but such Valid Claims and
	Pending Claims [...***...], then, during such time described in clauses (i) or (ii), not to extend beyond [...***...] years from the date of First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in such country, GSK will pay Regulus a royalty at the
	rate of [...***...] of the GSK Patent Royalty rates as described in Section 6.6.1 above. For example, but not limitation, if at the time of First Commercial Sale of a Licensed Product in a given country Regulus has a Valid Claim described
	in paragraph (a) above that has been pending for [...***...] years, then for the first [...***...] years after such First Commercial Sale the royalty rate shall be determined under paragraph (a) above and, if such claim does not issue
	within such [...***...] year period, then for a period of [...***...] years the royalty rate shall be determined under paragraph (b) above, and for the remaining [...***...] years after such First Commercial Sale, the royalty rate shall be
	determined under this paragraph (c). In no event shall




	 




	66




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	the royalty described in this paragraph (c) be paid for more than [...***...] years after First Commercial Sale of such Licensed Product in the relevant country, and in all cases the royalty
	shall be subject to paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) below. For the sake of clarity, the [...***...] year period described in this paragraph (c) shall not reduce the period during which royalties are payable pursuant to paragraphs
	(a) or (b) above, as applicable.




	(d) 

	Reduction of Royalty for Competition from Generic
	Products

	[...***...] amounts which the independent auditor believes to be due and payable hereunder to the Payee and shall disclose no other information revealed in such audit. Regulus shall also have the right to have audited, in accordance with this

	the audited Party as pass-through costs is less than the amount for which reimbursement was requested from the auditing Party to cover such pass-through costs, then the audited Party shall pay the auditing Party the difference between such amounts,
	to eliminate any discrepancy revealed by said inspection within [...***...] days and shall be entitled to a credit with respect to any overpayment made by such audited Party. The auditing Party shall pay for such audits, except that in the
	event that the royalty and, if applicable, [...***...] made by the audited Party were less than [...***...] of the undisputed amounts (or the amount requested to be reimbursed by the auditing Party, with respect to pass-through costs) that should
	have been paid during the period in question, the audited Party shall pay the reasonable costs of the audit.

	provide the other Party with prompt written notice of the commencement of any such Proceeding, or of any allegation of infringement of which such Party becomes aware, and shall promptly furnish the other Party with a copy of each communication
	relating to the alleged infringement that is received by such Party. Notwithstanding any of the above, in the event that one of the Parent Companies brings a claim against GSK, GSK shall have the sole right to control the defense of any such
	claim at its sole cost.





	8.4.2 


	Following Exercise of Program Option

	. If a Third Party initiates a

	Proceeding. In such event, Regulus shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend against such Proceeding at its sole cost and expense and thereafter shall have the sole right to direct the defense thereof, including, without
	limitation the right to settle such claim (but only with the prior written consent of GSK, not to be unreasonably withheld). In any event, the Party not defending such Proceeding shall reasonably assist the Party defending such Proceeding and
	cooperate in any such litigation at the request and expense of the Party defending such Proceeding. Each Party may at its own expense and with its own counsel join any defense directed by the other Party. Each Party shall provide the other
	Party with prompt written notice of the commencement of any

	Regulus in defending such Proceeding and cooperate in any such litigation at the request and expense of Regulus. Each Party may at its own expense and with its own counsel join any defense directed by the other Party. GSK shall provide
	Regulus with prompt written notice of the commencement of any such Proceeding, or of any allegation of infringement of which GSK becomes aware, and shall promptly furnish Regulus with a copy of each communication relating to the alleged infringement

	to such other Partys Know-How or Patent Rights, the general concepts of Section 8.5 will apply to the enforcement of such other Partys Know-How or Patent Rights or the defense of such invalidity claim (i.e., each Party has the right
	to enforce its own intellectual property, except that the relevant Commercializing Party will have the initial right, to the extent provided in Section 8.5, to enforce such Know-How or Patent Rights or defend such invalidity claim, and the
	other Party will have a step-in right, to the extent provided in Section 8.5, to enforce such Know-How or Patent Rights or defend such invalidity claim).

	Compound is being Developed, Regulus shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to institute, prosecute, and control a Proceeding (including, without limitation, with respect to any defense or counterclaim brought in connection therewith
	that the Regulus Patents or Regulus Collaboration Patents are invalid or unenforceable), by counsel of its own choice, and GSK shall have the right to be represented in that action by counsel of its own choice at its own expense, however, Regulus
	shall have the right to control such litigation, irrespective of whether GSK is represented by counsel of its own choice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GSK shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to institute, prosecute, and

	if Regulus has commenced good faith negotiations with an alleged infringer for elimination of such Competitive Infringement within such [...***...] day period) and, within such [...***...] day or extended period, GSK has exercised its Program Option

	exercise of a Program Option in reference to the Program under which such Option Compounds were Developed, GSK shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to institute, prosecute, and control a Proceeding with respect thereto (including,
	without limitation, with respect to any defense or counterclaim brought in connection therewith that the Regulus Patents, Regulus Collaboration Patents or Jointly-Owned Collaboration Patents are invalid or unenforceable) by counsel of its own choice
	at its own expense, and Regulus shall have the right, at its own expense, to be represented in that action by counsel of its own choice, however, GSK shall have the right to control such litigation, irrespective of whether Regulus is represented by

	concerning this Agreement, the Side Agreement or the Convertible Promissory Note, or the terms or the subject matter hereof or thereof, without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
	the foregoing, (a) each Commercializing Party, its Affiliates and Parent Companies may, without the other Partys




	 




	88







	approval, make disclosures pertaining solely to its Royalty-Bearing Products, provided, however, that the Commercializing Party will immediately notify (and provide as much advance notice as
	possible to) the other Party of any event materially related to such other Partys Royalty-Bearing Products (including any Regulatory Approval) so that the Parties may analyze the need for or desirability of publicly disclosing or reporting
	such event, any press release or other similar public communication by any Party related to efficacy or safety data and/or results of a Royalty-Bearing Product will be submitted to the other Party for review at least [...***...] Business Days (to
	the extent permitted by law) in advance of such proposed public disclosure, the other Party shall have the right to expeditiously review and recommend changes to such communication and the Party whose communication has been reviewed shall in good
	faith consider any changes that are timely recommended by the reviewing Parties and (b) to the extent information regarding this Agreement has already been publicly disclosed, either Party (or its Affiliates or the Parent Companies) may
	subsequently disclose the same information to the public without the consent of the other Party. In addition, GSK understands that Regulus is a private company, and that Regulus may disclose the financial terms of this Agreement, the Side
	Agreement or the Convertible Promissory Note to potential, bona fide investors and investment bankers, in each case, where practicable, under confidentiality provisions similar to and no less restrictive than those of this Agreement. Each Party
	shall give the other Party a reasonable opportunity (to the extent consistent with law) to review all material filings with the SEC describing the terms of this Agreement, the Side Agreement or the Convertible Promissory Note prior to submission of
	such filings, and shall give due consideration to any reasonable comments by the non-filing Party relating to such filing, including without limitation the provisions of this Agreement, the Side Agreement or the Convertible Promissory Note for which
	confidential treatment should be sought.





	9.4 Prior Confidentiality Agreement Superseded

	. This Agreement
	supersedes the Confidential Disclosure Agreement executed by Regulus, its Parent Companies and GSK on [...***...] (including any and all amendments thereto). All information exchanged between the Parties under that agreement shall be deemed
	Confidential Information hereunder and shall be subject to the terms of this Article 9.





	9.5 Remedies

	. Notwithstanding Section 13.1, each Party shall be entitled to seek, in addition to any other right or

	9.6 Publications

	. The Parties acknowledge that scientific lead time is a
	key element of the value of the collaboration under this Agreement and further agree to use Diligent Efforts to control public scientific disclosures of the results of the Development activities under this Agreement to prevent any potential adverse
	effect of any premature public disclosure of such results. The Parties shall establish a procedure for publication review and each Party shall first submit to the other Party through the Joint Patent Subcommittee an early draft of all such
	publications, whether they are to be presented orally or in written form, at least [...***...] days prior to submission for publication. Each Party shall review such proposed publication in order to avoid the unauthorized disclosure of a
	Partys Confidential Information and to preserve the patentability of inventions arising from the collaboration. If, as soon as reasonably possible, but no longer than [...***...] days following receipt of an advance copy of a Partys
	proposed publication, the other Party informs such Party that its proposed publication contains Confidential Information of the other Party, then such Party shall delete such Confidential Information from its proposed publication. In addition,
	if at any time during such [...***...] day period, the other Party informs such Party that its proposed publication discloses inventions made by either Party in the course of the collaboration under this Agreement that have not yet been protected
	through the filing of patent application, or the public disclosure of such proposed publication could be expected to have a material adverse effect on any Patent Rights or Know-How solely owned or Controlled by such other Party, then such Party
	shall either (a) delay such proposed publication, for up to [...***...] days from the date the other Party informed such party of its objection to the proposed publication, to permit the timely preparation and first filing of patent
	application(s) on the information involved or (b) remove the identified disclosures prior to publication. The Parties agree that all publications of results of the Development activities by either Party shall acknowledge the
	contribution of the other Party, its Affiliates, Parent Companies and Third Party collaborators, as applicable, to such results.

	as to whether there has been a material breach under Section 12.2.1, Section 12.2.2, Section 12.2.3 or Section 12.2.4 above, the Party which seeks to dispute that there has been a material breach may contest the allegation in
	accordance with Section 13.1. Notwithstanding the above sentence, the cure period for any allegation made in good faith as to a material breach under this Agreement will run from the date that written notice was first provided to the
	Breaching Party by the Non-breaching Party, except that such cure period shall be tolled (as more specifically set forth in Section 12.7.3(d) or Section 12.7.4(b), as applicable) during the pendency of any arbitration with respect to
	a dispute concerning any Regulus Diligence Failure Event or a Regulus Exclusivity Breach under Section 12.2.3, or a GSK Diligence Failure Event under Section 12.2.4. Subject to Section 12.7.3(d) and 12.7.4(b), any
	termination of the Agreement under this Section 12.2 shall become effective at the end of such ninety (90) day period, unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such ninety (90) day

	with respect to any previous default.





	12.3 GSK Unilateral Termination Rights

	. GSK shall have the right, at
	its sole discretion, exercisable at any time during the Agreement Term, to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or in part on a Collaboration Target-by-Collaboration Target basis, for any reason or for no reason at all, upon ninety
	(90) days written notice to Regulus, subject to the rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in Sections 12.7.1, 12.7.6, 12.7.7 and 12.8. Except as set forth in Section 12.7.1, 12.7.6, 12.7.7 or 12.8, GSK shall not have any
	additional cost, liability, expense, or obligation of any kind whatsoever on account of any termination under this Section 12.3. Notwithstanding the above, in the event of a disagreement between the Parties regarding safety concerns where
	GSK believes in good faith that such concerns merit the immediate termination of a Program, GSK shall have the right pursuant to this Section 12.3 to terminate such Program immediately upon written notice to Regulus and without the ninety
	(90) day notice period for termination. For purposes of clarity, in no event shall GSK have the right to exercise its right to terminate the Agreement under this Section 12.3 following Regulus notice of termination under
	Section 12.2, 12.4 or 12.6.





	12.4 Regulus Limited Unilateral Termination Rights. 

	Regulus shall
	have the right, exercisable upon written notice to GSK and at Regulus


	 sole discretion, to immediately terminate one or more Collaboration Targets or the entire Agreement (in which event Section 12.7.2 shall apply), but only in the
	event that GSK or one of its Affiliates acquires from [***] or one of [***] Affiliates any exclusive license, where such license includes the grant of exclusive rights to commercialize mir-122 miRNA Compounds; provided,
	however, that such termination right shall not apply in the event that Regulus and [***] have resolved via any agreement (or memorandum or letter of understanding or the like) substantially all matters then active between them relating
	to the potential infringement of claim(s) within the Regulus Patents relating to the Development, Manufacture or Commercialization of mir-122 miRNA Compounds prior to the acquisition by GSK of such an exclusive license from [***].
	Regulus shall only be permitted to exercise such termination right until the date that is [***] months from the date that GSK or its Affiliate acquires such an exclusive license or within [***] months of the date that GSK
	notifies Regulus that GSK or its Affiliate has acquired such exclusive license in accordance with Section 10.4.2, whichever is latest. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the acquisition by GSK of an option to acquire such an exclusive
	license or the acquisition by GSK of a non-exclusive license, or any other rights that do not amount to an exclusive license to commercialize such mir-122 miRNA Compounds shall not trigger Regulus termination right under this
	Section 12.4. For purposes of this Section 12.4, an exclusive license to commercialize may include the exclusive right to market, distribute, sell or offer to sell such mir-122 miRNA Compounds in any country or for any indication. Where
	the term exclusive license appears above in this Section 12.4, the Parties acknowledge and agree that such term also includes the functional equivalent of an exclusive license.





	12.5 Termination Pursuant to JSC or Expert Panel Decision Pursuant to Section 2.4 or Otherwise under
	Section 3.4.3.

	 In the event that the JSC or Expert Panel under Section 2.4, as the case may be decides to terminate a Program, on a Program-by-Program basis, due to scientific or safety concerns, or in the event that a Program
	otherwise terminates under Section 3.4.3, the Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Program as set forth in Section 12.7.5, subject to the exercise by GSK of its Terminated Program Option under Section 4.2.3 and its rights
	and obligations pursuant thereto.

	provisions of this Section 12.7.3(b). Notwithstanding any other provision under this Agreement or the Side Agreement, or any of the JV Agreements, or any interpretation of any one or any combination of the above to the contrary, no milestone
	payments or other fees, costs, other royalties or payments of any kind shall be

	owed to Regulus, its Affiliates or to any of Regulus Parent Companies, successors or assigns on account of the exclusive license acquired by GSK as described in this
	Section 12.7.3(b) as clarified in section 12.7.7(d), and the provisions of Article 6 regarding milestone and royalty payments shall not apply, except as expressly set forth in this Section 12.7.3(b);




	(v) Regulus shall have no further obligation to GSK to perform any Development or Manufacturing activities hereunder with respect
	to such terminated Collaboration Target(s), except pursuant to Section 5.3;




	(vi) GSK shall not be required to
	comply with any diligence obligations with respect to the terminated Collaboration Target(s) or any Collaboration Compounds, Option Compounds or Licensed Products directed thereto;




	(vii) All of Regulus and GSKs exclusivity obligations (including those of each Partys Affiliates and, with
	respect to Regulus, Parent Companies) under Article 7 shall immediately terminate and no longer be of any force or effect with respect to the Collaboration Target(s) being terminated (including all Collaboration Compounds and Licensed
	Products directed to such terminated Collaboration Target(s)); and




	(viii) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
	the contrary, all licenses granted to GSK under Article 5 with respect to Collaboration Compounds, Option Compounds or Licensed Products directed to the Collaboration Target that is the subject of any Program(s) for which GSK has
	previously exercised its Program Option as of the effective date of such termination, and which were not directed to the same Collaboration Target as the Program to which the Regulus uncured material breach relates, shall continue in full force, in
	accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, GSKs payment obligations under Article 6 with respect to any Collaboration Compounds, Option Compounds or Licensed Products resulting from such
	Program(s).




	(c) In the case of a termination by GSK of any Program(s) or the entire Agreement under
	Section 12.2 as a result of (i) an uncured Regulus Diligence Failure Event or (ii) a Regulus Exclusivity Breach, then the effects set forth in Section 12.7.3(a) or 12.7.3(b) above shall apply, as applicable depending upon
	whether GSK had exercised its Program Option for such Program, except that GSK shall be obligated to pay Regulus, in lieu of the royalties set forth in Section 12.7.3(a) or Section 12.7.3(b), a royalty at a rate of [***]
	percentage [***] more than Regulus Third Party License Pass-Through Costs with respect to Licensed Products resulting from the terminated Program(s) for which GSK acquires an exclusive license pursuant to the provisions of

	Affiliates or to any of Regulus Parent Companies, successors or assigns on account of the exclusive license acquired by GSK as described in this Section 12.7.3 as clarified in section
	12.7.7(d), and the provisions of Article 6 regarding milestone and royalty payments shall not apply, except as expressly set forth in this Section 12.7.3(c).




	(d) 

	Dispute.

	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Regulus disputes the allegation of a Regulus Diligence Failure Event in good faith and pursues such
	dispute in accordance with Section 13.1, upon initiation of the arbitration process as described in Section 13.1, (i) the cure period set forth in Section 12.2.1 or 12.2.2, as applicable, shall be tolled until the conclusion of
	the arbitration process and, if such conclusion is in GSKs favor, such cure period shall be extended as set forth in clause (A) below, and (ii) GSK shall be granted the licenses set forth in Section 5.2.1 solely for Development
	purposes (and Manufacturing for such Development purposes), but only on a non-exclusive basis, and without the right to grant sublicenses except for such Development purposes;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	(A) upon the conclusion
	of the arbitration process in GSKs favor, if Regulus fails to comply with the arbitrators final award on or before the end of the sixty (60) day period following the end of the initial cure period (as tolled as set forth in clause
	(i) above), termination shall become effective under Section 12.2.3 and the non-exclusive license granted under clause (ii) above shall automatically convert to an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses as set forth in
	Section 5.2.2, and (B) upon the conclusion of the arbitration process in Regulus favor, or Regulus compliance with the arbitrators final award within the cure period set forth in clause (A) above if the conclusion is
	in GSKs favor, the non-exclusive license granted under clause (ii) above shall terminate and revert to Regulus. During the entire time pending the final resolution of any such dispute, Regulus shall not grant any license to any Third
	Party under the Regulus Technology or Collaboration Technology with respect to the same subject matter, which would materially conflict or otherwise materially interfere with the potential exclusive license to GSK under this Section 12.7.3(d).




	(e) The Parties understand and agree that, due to the nature of the collaboration under this Agreement, damages to GSK
	resulting from a Regulus Diligence Failure Event under this Agreement would be difficult to calculate accurately, and thus the remedy set forth in Sections 12.7.3(c) and (d) represents a rational relationship between the damages from the Regulus
	Diligence Failure Event on the one hand, and the cumulative loss to GSK of its expectation interest and its lost investment and lost potential return on investment.





	12.7.4 


	Upon Termination by Regulus for Cause (other than for GSK Exclusivity Breach) under Section 12.2; Termination by Regulus for GSK Insolvency under Section 12.6

	.




	(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Regulus pursuant to Section 12.2.1 or 12.2.2, as
	applicable, with respect to any Collaboration Target(s),




	 




	110







	or in its entirety, upon the uncured material breach of GSK (except for GSKs material breach of its exclusivity obligations under Section 7.1, in which event Section 12.7.2 shall
	apply) where such material breach pertains to three (3) or more Collaboration Targets, or to the Agreement as a whole, or in the event of a termination of this Agreement in its entirety by Regulus pursuant to Section 12.6 upon the insolvency of
	GSK:




	(i) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all licenses granted to GSK with respect to
	Collaboration Compounds and Licensed Products directed to such terminated Collaboration Target(s) shall terminate and all such Collaboration Compounds and Licensed Products shall be deemed Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products or (if
	GSK has previously exercised its Program Option as of the effective date of such termination) Returned Licensed Products, and the exclusive licenses granted to Regulus under Section 5.1.2 and Section 5.1.3 shall apply with respect to such
	Refused Candidates and Refused Candidate Products, and Returned Licensed Products, respectively;




	(ii) Regulus shall be
	obligated to pay GSK any applicable Reverse Royalties under Section 6.7.1(I)(A) with respect to any such Refused Candidate Products, and under Section 6.7.1(I)(B) with respect to any such Returned Licensed Products;




	(iii) Regulus shall have no further obligation to GSK to perform any Development or Manufacturing activities hereunder with respect
	to the terminated Collaboration Target(s);




	(iv) GSK shall have no further obligation to Regulus to perform any
	Development, Manufacturing or Commercialization activities hereunder with respect to the terminated Collaboration Target(s), except as set forth in Section 12.7.6;




	(v) Regulus shall not be required to comply with any diligence obligations with respect to any Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products or Returned Licensed Products directed to such terminated
	Collaboration Target(s);




	(vi) All Program Options that are not exercised by GSK under Section 4.2 with respect to
	any Program(s) terminated pursuant to this Section 12.7.4(a) before the date of Regulus notice of termination shall be cancelled and of no force and effect;




	(vii) All of Regulus and GSKs exclusivity obligations (including those of each Partys Affiliates and, with
	respect to Regulus, Parent Companies) under Article 7 shall immediately terminate and no longer be of any force or effect with respect to the Collaboration Target(s) being terminated (including all Collaboration Compounds and Licensed
	Products directed to such terminated Collaboration Target(s)); and




	(viii) Section 12.7.6 shall apply.




	 




	111







	(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that GSK
	disputes the allegation of any GSK Diligence Failure Event in good faith and pursues such dispute in accordance with Section 13.1, upon initiation of the arbitration process as described in Section 13.1, (i) the cure period set forth
	in Section 12.2.1 or 12.2.2, as applicable, shall be tolled until the conclusion of the arbitration process and, if such conclusion is in Regulus favor, such cure period shall be extended as set forth in clause (A) below, and
	(ii) Regulus shall be granted the licenses set forth in Section 5.1.2 or 5.1.3, as the case may be, solely for Development purposes (and Manufacturing for such Development purposes), but only on a non-exclusive basis, and without the right
	to grant sublicenses except for such Development purposes;

	provided

	,

	however

	,

	that

	(A) upon the conclusion of the arbitration process in Regulus favor, if GSK fails to comply with the arbitrators final award on
	or before the end of the sixty (60) day period following the end of the initial cure period (as tolled as set forth in clause (i) above), termination shall become effective under Section 12.2.4 and the non-exclusive license granted
	under clause (ii) above shall automatically convert to an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses as set forth in Section 5.1.4, and (B) upon the conclusion of the arbitration process in GSKs favor, or GSKs
	compliance with the arbitrators final award within the cure period set forth in clause (A) above if the conclusion is in Regulus favor, the non-exclusive license granted under clause (ii) above shall terminate and revert to
	GSK. During the entire time pending the final resolution of any such dispute, GSK shall not grant any license to any Third Party under the GSK Technology or Collaboration Technology with respect to the same subject matter, which would
	materially conflict or otherwise materially interfere with the potential exclusive license to Regulus under this Section 12.7.4(b).




	(c) The Parties understand and agree that, due to the nature of the relationship of the Parties under this Agreement, damages to Regulus resulting from a GSK Diligence Failure Event under this
	Agreement would be difficult to calculate accurately, and thus the remedy set forth in this Section 12.7.4 represents a rational relationship between the damages from the GSK Diligence Failure Event on the one hand, and the cumulative loss to
	Regulus of its expectation interest and its lost investment and lost potential return on investment.





	12.7.5 


	Upon Termination by JSC (or Expert Panel) for Safety Concerns or Otherwise under Section 3.4.3; Terminated
	Program Options

	. In the event that this Agreement is terminated with respect to any Program(s) as a result of a decision of the JSC (or the Expert Panel under Section 2.4, as applicable) for scientific or safety concerns, or a Program
	is otherwise terminated under Section 3.4.3:




	(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, GSK
	shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to exercise its Terminated Program Option with respect to such terminated Program(s) as set forth in Section 4.2.3, upon which exercise the exclusive licenses granted to GSK under
	Section 5.2.1 shall become effective with respect to Collaboration




	 




	112







	Compounds, Option Compounds and Licensed Products resulting from such terminated Program(s), and the scope of such license shall be as modified and clarified under Section 12.7.7(d);




	(b) with respect to any such terminated Program(s) in no event shall any Collaboration Compounds Developed under
	such terminated Program(s) be deemed Refused Candidates, nor shall any Licensed Products containing any such Collaboration Compound(s) as an active ingredient(s) be deemed Refused Candidate Products, to which Regulus would otherwise
	have rights under Section 4.2.7 of this Agreement;




	(c) GSK shall be obligated to pay Regulus milestones as set
	forth in Section 6.5.3 and royalties as set forth in Section 6.6.1(d) (subject to Section 6.6.2), in each case depending on the stage of Development at which the termination occurred;




	(d) Regulus shall have no further obligation to GSK to perform any Development or Manufacturing activities hereunder with respect
	to such terminated Program(s) (including any Collaboration Compounds or Licensed Products resulting from such terminated Program(s)), except in the event that GSK exercises its Terminated Program Option under clause (a) above, in which
	case Section 5.3 shall apply;




	(e) GSK shall not be required to comply with any diligence obligations with respect
	to any Option Compounds or Licensed Products resulting from such terminated Program(s); and




	(f) All of Regulus
	and GSKs exclusivity obligations (including those of each Partys Affiliates and, with respect to Regulus, Parent Companies) under Article 7 shall immediately terminate and no longer be of any force or effect with respect to such
	terminated Program(s) (including any Collaboration Compounds and Licensed Products resulting from such terminated Program(s)).





	12.7.6 


	Technology Transfer.

	Upon termination of this Agreement, or any Collaboration Target(s) hereunder, by Regulus pursuant to Section 12.2, 12.4 or 12.6, or by GSK pursuant
	to Section 12.3, then paragraph (a) below shall apply, and for any termination by GSK pursuant to Section 12.2, 12.5 or 12.6, then Section 5.3 shall apply for all terminated Programs:




	(a) If such termination occurs prior to First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product(s) directed to the terminated
	Collaboration Target(s), during a period not to exceed [...***...] months thereafter, GSK will promptly deliver or disclose, as appropriate, to Regulus, at no cost to Regulus (except as set forth in clause (v) below), the GSK Technology and
	Collaboration Technology in GSKs possession or Control to the extent (A) relating specifically and primarily to Refused

	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Candidates, Refused Candidate Products and/or Returned Licensed Products if such GSK Technology and Collaboration Technology was used in connection with the Program (unless the Parties have
	mutually agreed to exclude it) or (B) covering a method of treatment or use with respect to a specific Collaboration Target that is the subject of such Program, including but not limited to: (i) information regarding the bulk drug
	substance and methods of manufacturing the same, including bulk and final product manufacturing processes, manufacturing data, batch records, vendor information and validation documentation, which is necessary for the exercise by Regulus of the
	Manufacturing rights granted under Section 5.1.2 or 5.1.3, as applicable, (ii) pre-clinical and clinical data and results (including pharmacology, toxicology, emulation and stability studies), adverse event data, protocol results,
	analytical methodologies, (iii) copies of patent applications and patents included within GSK Patents and GSK Collaboration Patents and other relevant patent information to the extent of any claims directed to subject matter which was used in
	connection with the Program (unless the Parties have mutually agreed to exclude it) or covering a method of treatment or use with respect to a specific Collaboration Target that is the subject of such Program, (iv) regulatory filings (including
	all relevant INDs and Regulatory Approvals), regulatory documentation, regulatory correspondence, and applicable reference standards, ownership of which regulatory filings shall be transferred to Regulus or, if such transfer is not reasonably
	practical, a right of reference shall be granted to Regulus, and (v) at Regulus request, any then existing supplies as shall be deemed suitable by Regulus of bulk drug substance or other materials, including drug substance, drug product
	and intermediate stocks, reference standards and analytical specification and testing methods used to Manufacture the applicable Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products or Returned Licensed Products, at GSKs Fully Absorbed Cost of
	Goods; in each case above to the extent pertaining specifically to any Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products and Returned Licensed Products and which are necessary to enable Regulus to Develop, Manufacture and Commercialize such Refused
	Candidates, Refused Candidate Products and/or Returned Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. In addition, the Parties will consider in good faith from time to time whether a safety data exchange agreement is required. Without
	limiting any of the foregoing, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to perform the transfer of such information and materials to Regulus in an orderly manner, and, upon delivery or disclosure, as appropriate, of such information and materials to Regulus,
	Regulus shall use Diligent Efforts to promptly implement such information and materials into its Development and Commercialization activities with respect to such Refused Candidates, Refused Candidate Products and/or Returned Licensed Products
	hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation on GSK to deliver or disclose, as appropriate, to Regulus the GSK Technology and other Know-How and information to the extent relating specifically and primarily to Refused Candidates,

	Parties have mutually agreed to exclude it), or covering a method of treatment or use with respect to a specific Collaboration Target that is the subject of such Program, in accordance with this
	Section 12.7.6 shall include (x) the transfer or license of any GSK Technology in the possession of any GSK Affiliate engaged by GSK as a subcontractor in accordance with Section 3.10, and (ii) the use of Diligent Efforts to
	transfer or license any GSK Technology in the possession of any Third Party subcontractor engaged by GSK as a subcontractor in accordance with Section 3.10.




	(b) If termination occurs following First Commercial Sale of the Licensed Product(s) directed to such terminated Collaboration Target(s), with respect to all affected countries, in addition to
	the items listed in clause (a) above, to the extent that GSK owns any trademark(s) that are specific to any Licensed Product(s), if GSK has used any such trademark extensively, publicly and exclusively in connection with the Licensed
	Product(s) and not any other products of GSK which are not Licensed Product(s), then GSK agrees to assign such trademark to Regulus, in each country where the Agreement is terminated with respect to such Licensed Product and where GSK has
	rights in the trademark. In such event, Regulus shall be responsible for recording the assignment in a timely manner and for any and all costs associated with the assignment and recordation in such country.




	(c) In addition to clause (a) or (b), GSK shall provide for reasonable transitional support, at no cost to Regulus, up to a
	maximum of one (1) FTE, as is reasonably required by Regulus, for up to an additional [...***...] months with respect to Returned Licensed Products, and any additional support as reasonably required by Regulus shall be charged to Regulus at rates to
	be agreed between the Parties.





	12.7.7 


	Special Consequences for Certain Scenarios and Clarifications





	(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if GSK unilaterally terminates this Agreement under
	Section 12.3 in its entirety or with respect to any Collaboration Target(s) and in the absence of an uncured material breach of the Agreement by Regulus with respect to such Collaboration Target(s), and GSK or its Affiliates or
	sublicensees directly challenges (each, as follows, a

	Validity Challenge

	) by filing any lawsuit, interference action or the like in the U.S. or any other Major Country the validity of any claim within an issued patent or patent
	application within the Regulus Technology that primarily relates to such terminated Collaboration Target(s), or Collaboration Compounds or related Licensed Products directed to such terminated Collaboration Target(s) (

	Program
	Patents

	), then Regulus shall no longer be obligated to pay to GSK any Reverse Royalties that would otherwise be applicable under Section 6.7 with respect to any Refused Candidate Products or Returned Licensed Products to which Regulus
	obtains rights under Section 12.7.1 arising from such termination of this Agreement by GSK pursuant to Section 12.3.




	(b) In addition, if, at any time prior to any termination of this Agreement with respect to any Collaboration Target(s) and in
	the absence of an uncured material breach of the Agreement by Regulus with respect to such Collaboration Target(s), GSK or its




	 




	115




	***Confidential Treatment Requested







	Affiliates or sublicensees initiates a Validity Challenge and then GSK unilaterally terminates this Agreement under Section 12.3 in its entirety or with respect to any Collaboration
	Target(s), then the consequences of termination set forth in clause (a) above shall apply.




	(c) For clarity, upon
	termination of any Collaboration Target or Program under Article 12 or Section 3.4.3 or 4.2.3, or where GSK declines to exercise all of its Program Options on or before the end of the applicable PoC Option Exercise Period for a given
	Program, the exclusivity obligations under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 shall no longer apply to bind or restrict GSK or its Affiliates, or Regulus or its Affiliates or Parent Companies, with respect to the terminated Collaboration Target or
	Program.




	(d) For the sake of clarity, the Parties understand and agree that, in the event that pursuant to the
	provisions of Sections 12.7.3(a), 12.7.3(c) or 12.7.5, GSK acquires an exclusive license from Regulus under Section 5.2.1 with respect to a terminated Program and the Collaboration Target and Collaboration Compounds relating to such
	Program, then, if such Program as of the date of such termination has not yet progressed to the point where any Collaboration Compounds at all or any Development Candidates or any Option Compounds or Licensed Products have been identified, then,
	notwithstanding any interpretation of Section 5.2.1 or any other provision of this Agreement or the Side Agreement or any of the JV Agreements or any combination of any of those to the contrary, GSK shall have the exclusive, sublicenseable
	right and license in the Field and in the Territory, under the exclusive license granted in Section 5.2.1, to use the Regulus Technology and Regulus rights in the Collaboration Technology, to identify and discover new (as well as any
	then-existing) Collaboration Compounds directed to such Collaboration Target, and to Develop, Manufacture and Commercialize any new and existing Collaboration Compounds as and into Licensed Products, and the license granted to GSK under
	Section 5.2.1 shall not be construed as limiting GSK only to use Regulus Technology and Collaboration Technology pertaining to Collaboration Compounds which are existing as of the date of such Program termination under Article 12.





	12.8 Accrued Rights; Surviving Provisions of the Agreement; Certain Clarifications.





	(a) Termination, relinquishment or expiration of this Agreement for any reason shall be without prejudice to any rights that shall
	have accrued to the benefit of any Party prior to such termination, relinquishment or expiration including, without limitation, the payment obligations under Article 6 hereof and any and all damages arising from any breach hereunder. Such
	termination, relinquishment or expiration shall not relieve any Party from obligations which are expressly indicated to survive termination of this Agreement.




	 




	116







	(b) For purposes of clarity, the Parties understand and agree that, (i) unless
	the exclusivity obligations under Article 7 are expressly stated as binding upon a Party beyond the termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to a Program or Collaboration Target, no such obligation(s) shall survive such
	termination or expiration; (ii) all Program Options for any Program(s) that is not terminated under Section 12.2 shall remain in effect in accordance with the terms of Article 4; and (iii) unless otherwise expressly stated,
	references in this Article 12 to on a Collaboration Target-by-Collaboration Target basis (and related references to Collaboration Target in such context) shall mean with respect to a Program that is directed to a
	particular Collaboration Target if such Program actually exists at the point that the relevant determination is made under Article 12, or with respect to all Collaboration Compounds and Licensed Products directed against a particular
	Collaboration Target, if the Program for such Collaboration Target has not yet commenced or if GSK has already exercised its Program Option for such Program at the point that the relevant determination is made under Article 12.




	(c) The provisions of Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.7 and 4.3.2 (solely with respect to the effects of termination set forth therein in
	connection with Article 12), Articles 5 and 6 (in each case in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 or to the extent any payment payable hereunder is owed to a Party but unpaid as of the effective date of termination), Sections
	6.9.3 and 6.10, Article 8 (with respect to (i) Jointly-Owned Collaboration Technology and (ii) any Know-How or Patent Rights Controlled by one Party but for which licenses granted to the other Party survive termination or expiration
	of this Agreement), and Articles 9, 11, 12, and 13 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, in accordance with their respective terms and conditions, and for the duration stated, and where no duration is stated,
	shall survive indefinitely.





	ARTICLE 13






	MISCELLANEOUS






	13.1 Dispute Resolution by Binding
	Arbitration

	. Any controversy or claim arising out of or under this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which is not settled under the procedures set forth in the appropriate provisions of Article 2 or Article 3 and which is not
	subject to the final decision-making authority of a Party under the provisions of Article 2 or Article 3, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration, held in New York City, New York, and administered by the American Arbitration
	Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties shall make reasonable efforts to appoint three
	(3) arbitrators, who are each mutually




	 




	117







	acceptable to GSK and Regulus, within [...***...] days of the initiation of the arbitration; in the event they are unsuccessful and do not agree to extend the time period, then the arbitrators
	shall be appointed in accordance with the rules. The Parties shall share the expenses for the arbitrators, but shall otherwise be responsible for their own fees in relation to such arbitration. Until such time as arbitrators are appointed,
	the Parties may seek judicial relief for interim measures, such as injunctive relief, in any court having competent jurisdiction. For clarity, the Parties understand and agree that binding arbitration pursuant to this Section 13.1 shall
	not apply to alter or modify the indemnity obligations of the respective Parties under Article 11, but arbitration may be sought to interpret such obligations. For clarity, the Arbitrators shall not have authority or discretion to decide
	any matter other than the matter for decision before them, and any such decision shall not include any award or determination which would amend the applicable terms of the Agreement.





	13.2 Governing Law

	. This Agreement and any dispute arising from the performance or breach hereof shall be governed by
	and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, U.S.A., without reference to conflicts of laws principles.





	13.3 Assignment

	. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either Party to any Third Party or Parent Company, in the case of Regulus, (except as expressly stated below) without the prior
	written consent of the other Party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) either Party may assign this Agreement, without any consent of the other Party, to an Affiliate, to a Third Party,
	or to the Parent Company of such Party, in the case of Regulus, that acquires all or substantially all of the business or assets of such Party to which the subject matter of this Agreement pertains (whether by merger, reorganization, acquisition,
	sale or otherwise), and (b) either Party may assign or transfer its rights to receive royalties and milestones under this Agreement (but no liabilities), without any consent of the other Party, to an Affiliate, to its Parent Company, or to a
	Third Party in connection with a payment factoring transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to its Affiliate or Parent Company without the prior written consent
	of the other Party; provided, that, such assignee is able to exercise Diligent Efforts equivalent to those required to be exercised by such assigning Party and otherwise perform all of the obligations of the assigning Party hereunder and assumes in
	writing all of the relevant liabilities and obligations of the assigning Party hereunder. No assignment and transfer shall be valid and effective unless and until the assignee/transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of
	this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs, administrators and permitted assigns of the Parties. Any assignment not in accordance with the

	GlaxoSmithKline and Regulus Therapeutics
	Form Strategic Alliance To Develop MicroRNA Targeted Therapeutics to Treat Inflammatory Diseases






	Companies Announce Significant
	microRNA Therapeutics Collaboration





	LONDON & PHILADELPHIA & CARLSBAD, Calif., Apr 17, 2008 (BUSINESS WIRE) 
	GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Regulus Therapeutics LLC (Regulus) today announced a worldwide strategic alliance to discover, develop and market novel microRNA-targeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
	inflammatory bowel disease. Regulus is a joint venture between Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY) and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ISIS).




	The alliance leverages Regulus unique expertise and intellectual property position in the discovery and development of microRNA-targeted therapeutics and provides GSK with an option to license
	product candidates directed at four different microRNA targets with relevance in inflammatory disease. Regulus will be responsible for the discovery and development of the microRNA antagonists through completion of clinical proof of concept, unless
	GSK chooses to exercise its option earlier. After exercise of the option, GSK will have an exclusive license to drugs developed under each program by Regulus for the relevant microRNA target for further development and commercialization on a
	worldwide basis. Regulus will have the right to further develop and commercialize any microRNA therapeutics which GSK chooses not to develop or commercialize.




	Regulus will receive $20 million in upfront payments from GSK, including a $15 million option fee and a $5 million note (guaranteed by Isis and Alnylam) that will convert into Regulus common stock in the
	future under certain specified circumstances. Regulus could also be eligible to receive up to $144.5 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of the four microRNA-targeted therapeutics discovered and developed as part
	of the alliance. In addition to the potential of nearly $600 million Regulus could receive in option, license and milestone payments, Regulus would also receive tiered royalties up to double digits on worldwide sales of products resulting from the
	alliance.




	We are focused on finding innovative medicines through both internal efforts and by virtualizing a portion of the
	inflammatory diseases pipeline. We are very excited to be working




	 




	G-1




	 







	with Regulus and exploring the therapeutic opportunities in inflammation offered by targeting microRNAs, an exciting new area of biology, said Jose Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, Ph.D., Senior
	Vice President and head of the Immuno-Inflammation Center of Excellence for Drug Discovery of GSK. When associated with an aberrant inflammatory response, microRNAs represent disease targets whose therapeutic modulation could revolutionize the
	way we treat immune diseases and provide benefits not readily achievable with todays medicines.




	GSK is an outstanding
	partner for Regulus, and we look forward to expanding our efforts in inflammation where a new class of therapeutics could offer novel options to treat disease, said Kleanthis G. Xanthopoulos, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of
	Regulus. microRNA therapeutics represent an exciting new frontier for pharmaceutical research, opening many opportunities including those present in inflammation and immune diseases. As a leading microRNA therapeutics company, Regulus has the
	expertise and access to proprietary antisense technologies, which provide the tools and potential to quickly move therapeutic programs toward the clinic. Through its relationship with Alnylam and Isis, Regulus also has a vast patent estate in
	microRNAs.




	About microRNAs




	microRNAs are a recently discovered class of genetically encoded small RNAs, approximately 20 nucleotides in length, and are believed to regulate the
	expression of a large number of human genes. microRNA therapeutics represent a new approach for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases. The inappropriate absence or presence of specific microRNAs in various cells has been shown to be
	associated with specific human diseases including cancer, viral infection, and metabolic disorders. Targeting microRNAs with novel therapeutic agents could result in high-impact and broadly acting treatments for human diseases.




	About Regulus Therapeutics LLC




	Regulus is a
	biopharmaceutical company formed to discover, develop and commercialize microRNA therapeutics. Regulus was founded in late 2007 as a joint venture between Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a leader in RNAi therapeutics, and Isis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in
	antisense technologies and therapeutics. Isis and Alnylam scientists and collaborators were the first to discover microRNA antagonist strategies that work in vivo in animal studies (Krutzfeldt et al. Nature 438, 685-689 (2005); Esau et al. Cell
	Metab., 3, 87-98 (2006)). Isis and Alnylam have also created and consolidated key intellectual property for the development and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Regulus maintains facilities in Carlsbad, California. For more information,
