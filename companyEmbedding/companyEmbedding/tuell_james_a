Product Description▼▲
Delve into the original text of the Bible, even with no prior knowledge of Hebrew. In Interpreting Prophetic Literature, James Nogalski has devised an ingenious exegetical method that focuses on the distinctive elements of prophetic literature rather than on narrative material. This book unpacks the theological richness of the text, carefully situated within its literary, historical, and conceptual contexts.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Exegeting a textburrowing deep into its history, language, and literary structureis an indispensable skill for any serious student of the Bible. Given their theological richness and poetic power, the prophetic texts of the Hebrew Bible would seem to be prime candidates for exegetical examination, but they often pose difficulty. In this book, James Nogalski offers solid, practical guidance on how to read and exegete a prophetic text in its literary, historical, and conceptual contexts. Assuming no prior knowledge of Hebrew, Nogalski devises an exegetical method that focuses on the distinctive elements of prophetic literature, rather than on the narrative material one finds in practically all introductions to exegesis. He provides clear examples for understanding poetic texts, prophetic genres, changing voices, and other important aspects of these texts. This book offers essential tools to help readers navigate the particular challenges and opportunities of interpreting the prophets. 


Author Bio▼▲
James D. Nogalski is Professor and Chair of Graduate Studies in the Department of Religion at Baylor University. He has published numerous articles and books on the Old Testament prophets.


Endorsements▼▲
Jim Nogalski has produced a tremendously useful exegetical primer for the prophetic books of the Bible (rather than yet another summary of their contents). There is nothing else like it currently in print. Concisely and judiciously, he treats prophetic speech formulas, parallelism, key terms, symbolic acts, literary forms, syntactical connectors, catchwords and major themes. He pays particular attention to the basic challenge of identifying speaker, addressee and context, especially in translation, and provides well-chosen examples. I recommend his book for any introductory course on the Prophets.
-Stephen B. Chapman, 
Duke University

Seminary students, professors, and interested lay persons will thank Nogalski profusely for this clear and concise demystification of the terms, tools, and techniques utilized by biblical scholars. He provides more than a mere glossary of terms, demonstrating instead the use and usefulness of virtually the complete arsenal available to a student of Israel's prophetic literature. Most importantly, he makes this demonstration with a view toward the ultimate objective of a theological reading of the prophets, namely, the final step of hearing them in the context of a contemporary life of faith within a community of faith.
-Mark E. Biddle, 
Russell T. Cherry Professor of Old Testament, Baptist Theological Seminary at Richmond


Nogalski's book is the product of years of practical teaching experience, as well as scholarly reflection upon these ancient texts. Students coming to the exegesis of prophetic literature for the first time will find here a wealth of useful and immediately applicable information concerning how prophetic literature works, from its characteristic compositional elements to its historical settings, collection, and editing.
-Steven Tuell, 
James A. Kelso Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary

Description



        The Understanding the Bible Commentary Series helps any reader navigate the strange and sometimes intimidating literary terrain of the Bible. These accessible volumes break down the barriers between the ancient and modern worlds so that the power and meaning of the biblical texts become transparent to contemporary readers. The contributors tackle the task of interpretation using the full range of critical methodologies and practices, yet they do so as people of faith who hold the text in the highest regard. Pastors, teachers, and lay people alike will cherish the easily understandable truth found in this commentary series.

Genesis is the chronological and theological gateway to the Bible. It lays the foundations for understanding God, humanity, and his dealings with us.

This skillfully written commentary guides the reader through the fascinating narrative of the world’s early generations and the beginning of God’s people.

Pages: 352

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Amidst the laws and lists, Leviticus and Numbers display the holiness and awesomeness of God, the importance of purity, the nature of worship, the value of obedience, and the consequences of disobedience in the early life of Israel. This commentary takes on these two often neglected books of Scripture with the conviction that modern believers can gain much benefit from them.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Joshua, Judges, and Ruth tell the history of Israel’s early, premonarchical life in Canaan. Their narratives mix exhilarating stories of God’s deliverance and somber examples of the people’s disobedience. They also include elements that are strange to modern readers. The commentators explore the history and culture of the era to explain the difficult issues raised and relate the lessons to contemporary Christian life.

The books of 1 and 2 Samuel tell the story of an important time in Israel’s history: the beginning of the monarchy under Saul and the rise and reign of King David. It’s a story of individual people as they relate to God. It’s also a story of politics and the dynamics of power—including its use and abuse.


Mary J. Evans is a lecturer in Old Testament and the director of the Christian Life and Ministry course at the London Bible College. Her publications include Woman in the Bible and Prophets of the Lord, and she is an editor of the Study Bible for Women: The New Testament.

Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In contrast to literary and historical skepticism about the accounts of Israel and Judah in the divided kingdom, Provan examines 1 and 2 Kings as a unified and historical narrative. He helps the reader see that these books provide insight into the kings and prophets—and teach about God and his ways.


Iain W. Provan is the Marshall Sheppard Professor of Biblical Studies at Regent College. He is also an ordained minister of the Church of Scotland.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Allen and Laniak direct the reader’s attention to the literary elements of these three postexilic books while examining the books’ historical setting and details—which, in turn, point to valuable lessons.

Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 512

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Job delves into questions as old as humanity and as contemporary as today’s headlines. How does God’s justice work? How are we to understand suffering? More importantly, how are we to respond to it? Through careful analysis and explanation of Job’s dialogue, Wilson sheds light on its core message: a call to faithfully persevere by entrusting the answers to God.


Gerald H. Wilson received his PhD from Yale University, and he was a professor of Old Testament and biblical Hebrew at Azusa Pacific University. He wrote The Editing of the Hebrew Psalter and numerous articles for journals, encyclopedias, and reviews.

The Psalms are beloved for their poetic beauty, poignant expression of human emotion and spiritual experience, and soaring depictions of God’s glory.

Further, it highlights the psalms in their liturgical role as part of Israel’s worship, with an eye toward enriching contemporary worship and prayer.

Jeremiah is a long and complex book written in the closing years of Judah before the exile.

Pages: 384

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The modern reader encounters unfamiliar territory in Ezekiel, with its otherworldly visions and the peculiar actions of its author.

Mark

Author: Larry W. Hurtado
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This volume transports modern readers back to the days of Mark’s original audience and helps us to understand and apply his unique writing and challenges to the church. Very possibly the oldest written account of the ministry of Jesus that we possess, the Gospel of Mark is a vivid and fast-paced narrative of the Good News about Jesus.


Hurtado has an excellent feel for Mark, focusing especially on the theological meaning of the gospel. He is surefooted in exposition of difficult passages, refusing to get bogged down in detail but at the same time refusing to provide a superficial answer. . . . The high quality of Hurtado’s scholarship shines through his engaging prose.
—K. E. Brower, senior lecturer in biblical studies, Nazarene Theological College

Author: Craig A. Evans
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 416

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Packing a lot of historical detail into a small space, Luke is a perfect introduction to this beautiful and theologically rich Gospel. The clear writing and logical explanations help you understand Luke’s difficult passages and the scholarly discussions about them.


Craig Evans’ volume on Luke is a model of the series. The writer is as aware of the main questions which dominate Lucan scholarship today as he is of its methods and useful findings.
—Max Turner, emeritus professor of New Testament, London School of Theology
This commentary fulfils the aims of the series in an admirable way. . . . The presentation of the major themes and emphases is concise and well done. Because of contemporary controversies there is a special section on the problem of the supposed anti-Semitic aspects of Luke. . . . [Craig Evans] shows his mastery of Lucan study. . . . The commentary ought to be in all theological libraries.

Pages: 400

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




John the apostle, the last of the original 12, writes the final and most spiritual of the four Gospels. His intention is to clearly announce that Jesus is the eternal Son of God who has come in the flesh to redeem the world.

Acts

Author: David J. Williams
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 512

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Acts leaves no stone unturned as it brings every feature of interest and debate about the book of Acts to our attention. Careful and accurate, this incisive exploration of Luke’s account of the events following the resurrection will shed light on cultural and political realities at the time the church was in its infancy.


Williams has left virtually no stone unturned in his attempt to bring every feature of interest and debate to the reader’s attention . . . this well-written commentary is recommended to all, teacher and student alike.
—Craig A. Evans, Payzant Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Acadia Divinity College

Romans

Author: James R. Edwards
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 416

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Romans is a towering epistle and arguably Paul’s most difficult letter to understand and interpret. This volume clearly shows the goodness of God as displayed in his righteousness revealed in Christ for our salvation. Enjoy this edifying journey through the most logical and doctrinally oriented of Paul’s letters.


James Edwards . . . has written the commentary I have been looking for: an exposition of the English text of Romans that takes account of the latest scholarship, refuses to duck the tough theological questions that keep popping up in Romans, and communicates in uncluttered English and effective illustrations.
—Critical Review of Books in Religion


James R. Edwards is the Bruner-Welch Professor of Theology at Whitworth University. He is a member of the Center of Theological Inquiry in Princeton.







1 Corinthians

Author: Marion L. Soards
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 416

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




1 Corinthians is a clear, up-to-date, and thoroughly understandable treatment of Paul’s letter to the church at Corinth, focusing attention on what the text actually means rather than scholarship about the text. It addresses many relevant issues, including sexual immorality, religious diversity, and the false teaching among leaders in Corinth. It also sheds light on how that culture affected the early church, revealing how many of those persistent problems are still faced by Christians in the world today.


Soards’ commentary is a clear, up-to-date, balanced, religiously sensitive treatment of 1 Corinthians. Aimed at the general reader, it will find a welcome home in college and seminary classrooms and in the pastor’s study.
—Charles H. Talbert, distinguished professor of religion, Baylor University
This commentary is solid but readable, welcoming yet challenging. It focuses attention on the biblical text rather than on scholarship about the text. This commentary should be the first one students read when studying 1 Corinthians.
—Alan Culpepper, dean, McAfee School of Theology, Mercer University
Here is a commentary abreast of contemporary scholarship communicated in a readable style. It fulfills the goal of the series for which it is written. I recommend it for college and seminary students.
—Restoration Quarterly

The author of more than 20 books, he is active in a number of scholarly societies and associations, and he has published dozens of articles and reviews in leading theological dictionaries and professional journals worldwide.







2 Corinthians

Author: James M. Scott
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 304

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The apostle Paul writes a letter to the church in Corinth that defends his calling and exhorts unity through love as the church collects gifts for believers in Jerusalem. He also helps us understand and act on the truth that Christianity does not renounce and forsake the world but, in love, renews it. This commentary offers an in-depth look at this letter full of reconciliation and harmony.


Don’t be fooled by its size! Scott’s commentary is to the point, clearly written, and filled with provocative proposals for reading this complex letter. From the centrality of Paul’s self-understanding and the unity of the letter to merkabah mysticism, Korah’s rebellion, and the Jewish concept of the nations, Scott’s reading rightly reminds us of just how Jewish the Apostle to the Gentiles was and of how much we must know his milieu to understand his message! Here is an insightful introduction to both the influences and intent of 2 Corinthians.
—Scott J. Hafemann, St. Mary’s College, University of St. Andrews


James M. Scott is a professor of religious studies at Trinity Western University. He is the author of Paul and the Nations, Adoption as Sons of God, and Exile.







Galatians

Author: L. Ann Jervis
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 192

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Paul’s letter to the church in Galatia is among the most riveting, personal, and persuasive of the apostle’s writings. This volume provides delightful insights into Paul’s mission-minded heart by detailing the many ways he asserts adherence to the gospel of Jesus and by pointing out his opposition to the false gospel of his adversaries.


An informed, perceptive, and readable exposition of Galatians—a truly excellent introductory commentary for ‘the Christian community at large,’ which is its intended audience.
—Richard N. Longenecker, distinguished emeritus professor of New Testament, McMaster Divinity College
The most helpful contribution that this commentary brings to its intended audience is its concise and even-handed introduction. Jervis addresses the situation and opponents and the date and audience options in a way that would be very helpful for a lay Bible reader who might otherwise be overwhelmed by the competing theories expressed in a more technical commentary. . . . Another feature that adds value to the commentary is the additional notes contained at the end of each section. These notes reflect Jervis’ expertise in the field, and often include excellent exegetical comments, added background information, helpful bibliographic references, and surveys of the various ways in which a phrase or verse have been interpreted. . . . In the end Jervis’ commentary is a very concise, well-written and reliable exposition of the ‘New Perspective’ approach to Galatians.
—Ashland Theological Journal


L. Ann Jervis is a professor of New Testament at Wycliffe College and Trinity College. She is the author of The Purpose of Romans and coeditor of The Gospel in Paul.

Ephesians, Colossians, Philemon discusses the origin, authorship, purpose, and contents of these New Testament letters. Scholarly, yet easy to understand, this volume explores the nuances of Paul’s messages to the church, which deal with many of the same issues faced by the church today.

Philippians

Author: F. F. Bruce
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 208

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The letter from Paul known as the ‘epistle of joy’ is a thank-you note to the believers at Philippi for their help in his hour of need. It provides instruction on Christian unity. His central thought is simple: only in Jesus are real unity and joy possible. This commentary pulls the rich truth from this letter and makes it live for us today.


This is a valuable commentary. . . . I find [F. F. Bruce’s] exposition and exegetical/philological judgments and comments very competent and insightful. He is very fair and gives the opinion of others in detail while he justifies his own judgments with good argumentation.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In 1 and 2 Thessalonians, you will find a concise and clear explanation of Paul’s letters to the church in Thessalonica. Written from an evangelical perspective, this commentary explains the significance of Greek terms in order to bring out the fullness of the Apostle Paul’s heart and the relevant applications to our everyday lives.


Dr. Williams has given us a fine commentary on the Thessalonian correspondence. He writes explicitly for the general reader but that does not mean that he has overlooked difficult or controversial passages. He deals with them simply in a way that we can all understand. A feature of the commentary is the way the author takes pains to explain the significance of Greek terms and thus to bring out the force of what the Apostle has written. Dr. Williams writes simply and clearly and he has put us all in his debt.

1 and 2 Timothy, Titus explores Paul’s heartfelt concern for the newly planted churches and the leaders who served in them. These letters of compassion, instruction, and admonition were meant to instruct and strengthen the leaders and the members of these churches. Filled with great insight taken from the original language, this volume will help you understand more deeply the pastoral love of Paul.


[Fee’s commentary on 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus] . . . is ideal for students, pastors, and teachers. It is a model of clarity and organization and consistently reflects a judicious examination of exegetical issues. Indeed . . . I think it is one of the best available [commentaries] on the Pastoral Epistles. Fee’s skill in writing commentaries is as evident in this volume as it was in his magisterial volume on 1 Corinthians.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This commentary reveals the true purpose of the book of Hebrews: to exhort and encourage Jewish Christians to remain faithful to Jesus and not to turn back to Judaism. These words of comfort—intended to help early believers to hold fast to the Christian hope without wavering in the face of persecution, ridicule, and insults—contain lessons that can guide our own faith today.


Of all the major New Testament books none perhaps stands in greater need of elucidation and exposition for the modern reader than the letter to the Hebrews. It is therefore an occasion of much interest to the Bible-reading public that such a volume as Dr. Hagner’s . . . is on hand to assist them. . . . His writing shows that he is en rapport with the epistle, determined to let it speak its own relevant message to those who wonder how the Jewish messiah can be the world’s redeemer, and anxious to help those who find this part of the New Testament strange and forbidding.

Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




As the author of this commentary explains, the very first word of John’s composition, “revelation,” is an essential clue for the interpreter of Revelation. The primary intent of this literature is to reveal the “mysteries of God” to believers presently experiencing oppression and suffering. This commentary will help you discover the meaning behind the complex ideas and images found in this last book of the Bible.


Wall’s commentary is a valuable contribution to the study of Revelation. It interacts well with most of the leading contemporary scholarship in the field. It provides an angle of perspective on John’s vision that opens some new vistas into its meaning and provides healthy correctives of many misconceptions. This is a useful resource for college and seminary classes on Revelation and a helpful tool for those with theological/biblical training who would lead Bible studies on Revelation.

Abstract:

            A hinge covering system designed to protect an operable door hinge from paint spray, paint splatters, or any other coating that may be applied to the surface of a door and/or frame. The hinge covering system comprises a plurality of preformed tape pieces. The tape pieces having been preformed to match areas of the door hinge so as to prevent excessive overlap covering the door or frame, yet adequately protect the door hinge. Each of the preformed tape pieces are designed to adhere to and thereby protect different areas of the door hinge. Specifically, the hinge covering system is comprised of tape pieces pre-measured to fit the exposed areas of the hinge straps, the hinge barrel, and the top and bottom of the hinge pin. At least one of the tape pieces is formed so as to protect the barrel portion of the door hinge without causing friction or adhesion to the barrel portion thus allowing for un-obscured operation of the door with the hinge covering system fully installed. The hinge covering system prior to installation on a hinge is stored as a roll of tape. Each preformed tape piece is stored in the tape roll with a perforation or equivalent means to remove each preformed tape piece from the roll to the preformed tape piece's exact measurement, thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste product.

Description:

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a means for covering a door hinge so as to protect the hinge from paint or coating while the door and/or frame of the door are being painted and/or coated. More particularly the present invention provides a hinge covering system which allows for rapid and efficient installation of the system which accurately protects the door hinge while also maintaining un-obstructed use of the hinge, and thereby the door.In the field of painting building interiors, interior doors and their frames must be painted as well as the interior walls and ceiling. When painting the door and door frame area, a common problem arises that paint or coating will adhere to door hinges supporting the door to the interior walls. Since the standard door hinges are metal with a polished finish, paint adhered to the hinges generally has a non-aesthetic appearance and is therefore not desired when painting the building interior. As such, the hinges of the doors must be protected from paint and coating during the painting of the building interior.The standard door hinge used in most modern homes and offices is comprised of three portions: a left strap, a right strap and a pin. Three screws are used to secure one strap to a frame, and three additional screws secure the remaining strap to the door. Each strap has either a two open cylindrical portion or a three open cylindrical portion, referred to as knuckles, which are designed to interpose one another and receive the pin into the opening for securing the door to the frame and maintaining normal operation of the door. When the hinge is in an operable state, the knuckles and pin exposed between the door and the frame are referred to as the barrel.There are a variety of door hinge sizes available to the building industry. They all vary in length and width depending on the size and weight of the door they are intended to support.The most commonly used in residential housing is called a “butt hinge”. Each strap measures approximately 3½″ in length and 1½″ in width, with the cylindrical portion measuring approximately 7/16″. Totaling the overall width to approximately 3½″. This is a “full mortise hinge”. The thickness of the hinge strap, which is approximately 1/16″ is recessed into the door and frame. Different styles are available; the first style has two ⅝″ radius cuts on one edge of each strap, the second style has two ¼″ radius cuts on one edge of each strap, a third style has squared corners on each strap, and the fourth style consists of one strap having a radius cut and the other strap squared. The cylindrical protrusions that extend from each strap also vary in size, depending on the hinge size. Standard pre-made Residential Hinges are readily available in the following dimensions:  3″ by 3″ with ⅝″ radius corners3½″ by 3½″ with ⅝″ radius corners4″ by 4″ with ⅝″ radius corners3½″ by 3½″ with ¼″ radius corners4″ by 4″ with ¼″ radius corners3½″ by 3½″ with square corners/⅝″ radius corners4″ by 4″ with square corners/⅝″ radius corners.  In commercial building the most commonly used hinges are “architectural hinges” which range from 3½″ to 6″ in length and 3″ to 6″ in width, these normally have a larger cylinder (these hinges may also have the same radius cut on each strap, or each strap could be different as with the “butt hinge”). Another style of commercial hinge is an “architectural ball bearing hinge”. This type of hinge is used for large or very heavy doors. These hinges are similar to the “butt hinge” and the “architectural hinge” with the exception of a ball bearing device which is machined into the knuckles, allowing the hinge to carry more weight without wearing out or breaking. Standard pre-made Commercial Architectural Hinges are readily available in the following dimensions:  3″×3″ with square corners3½″ by 3½″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius4″ by 4″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius4½″ by 4½″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius  Standard pre-made Architectural Ball Bearing Hinges (heavy duty) are readily available in the following dimensions:  4″ by 4″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius4½″ by 4½″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius5″ by 5″ with square corners or square/⅝″ radius  Several options are available for protecting the hinges during painting. The two most common options are that the doors may be removed so that the hinges are not present during painting, or the hinge may be covered with tape or similar adhesive which absorb any paint applied to the area of the door hinge and thereby protects the hinge. However, there are a number of drawbacks to utilizing either of these methods to protect the hinge.First, removing the doors and hinges prior to painting, and re-installing the doors after painting, is time consuming. Specifically, each hinge is normally held to the door and the frame by six screws, each of which must be individually removed and re-installed. Alternatively, if only the pin is removed from the cylinder portion to separate the door from the frame, each strap would have to be taped separately and the doors could still only receive one coating on one side at a time. Further, the doors must be stored during the painting process. If the doors are to be painted and they were removed from the hinge, this method would allow only one side at a time to receive the coating intended. After drying, the doors would be reversed and the other side coated. These extra steps create a need for additional labor and therefore add further time consumption to the painting process.Second, covering the door hinges is either also time consuming or is inadequate to properly protect the hinges. The portions of the hinge exposed during the painting process must be protected in a manner which adequately covers the hinge but also does not disrupt the painting or coating of the door and frame. In order to properly shape common painting tapes to cover the hinge requires additional time, as the pieces of tape must be cut and sized at the job site. Hence, properly forming the tape at the job site also requires additional labor and thereby further adds time consumption to the painting process. Alternatively, the protective tape is applied in a rapid manner without regard to exactly matching the area of the exposed hinge. This taping procedure results in poor protection which in turn results in either paint adhered to the hinge or lack of adequate paint coverage to the door and/or frame. Hence, the aesthetic value of the painting is decreased.An additional problem which results from covering the hinges with a protective adhesive is that operation of the door becomes difficult due to adhesive being in contact with the moving portions of the door hinge. Specifically, the standard door hinge includes a barrel portion which is exposed between the door and the frame. This barrel portion is rotated within itself when the door is opened and closed. Adhesive of a protective coating is likely to either, interfere with the operation of the door, and/or pull or disfigure the protective tape, thereby disrupting the protective tape's coverage of the hinge. In some instances, the protective tape may even be pulled off by repeated opening and closing of the door leaving the hinge exposed during painting.In response to these problems of protecting door hinges during painting, a number of solutions have been presented. However, each of these solutions fails to adequately and efficiently cover the door hinge, and also maintain un-obscured operation of the door. Specifically, preconfigured tape or masks for paint protection of hinges have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,961,602; 4,195,590; 4,691,409; 4,796,330; 5,056,191; and 5,882,788.The '602, '590 and '330 patents each disclose masks which are flexible members that have a pressure treated, sensitive adhesive coating and are pre-shaped to be applied over the hinge. However, the '602 and '590 masks are useable only with the doors that have been removed from the hinges, or separated from the door frame. Hence, the design of the '602 and '590 prevents them from being installed or applied to a door that is in an operable position. Further, the masks offer no coverage to the top and bottom of the pin and barrel portions of the hinge.The '330 device maybe applied to a door in an operable position. The '330 device consists of two monolithic parts. One of which is configured to provide full coverage of the front faces of the leaves and barrel of the assembled hinge. The other being configured to cover the exposed parts of the back faces of the leaves and barrel. However, this system includes adhesive applied to the rotating barrel portion of the hinge. Thus, the '330 device will interfere with the operation of the door and/or be removed by the opening and closing of the door based on the adherence of the mask system to the moving barrel portion.U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,191 discloses a system comprising a pad with a protective coating that is peeled off from a cut out and applied to the hinge. U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,788 is very similar to the '191 patent in that they both have small rectangular protrusions that extend from the main body of the adhesive. These are intended to cover the knuckle portions of the hinge; one side having two protrusions, and the other side having three protrusions. As these protrusions have adhesive to secure the protective coating to the knuckle, they will interfere with the operation of the door and/or be removed by the opening and closing of the door based on the adherence of the mask system to the moving barrel portion.The '788 and '191 also suffer from the defect that it is difficult to align all of these protrusions and the corners of the main body of the plate at the same time. The piece with three protrusions has to be used on the appropriate hinge plate and the one with the two protrusions has to be used on the remaining hinge plate. Further, throughout an entire house there are left hand swing doors which open to the left, and right hand swing doors which open to the right. Thus, the systems of the '788 and '191 patent would be confusing to use due to difficulty ensuring that the right piece of hinge cover is applied to the correct side of the hinge plate. Also, all doors in a house or office do not always open to the hinges fullest capability, due to a wall or another object of some sort restricting the movement. Therefore, the small protrusions that extend from the body of the hinge plate cover would have to either be trimmed back or tucked into the very thin space between the rotating pieces. If this is not done, the protrusions would overlap onto the opposite hinge cover and could then break loose, due to the movement of the rotating pieces. The portion of the hinge barrel that is seen when the door is completely closed is covered in the same manner (having to align the protrusions with the rotating portions).Additional tape hinge systems have been proposed which utilize protective magnetic or plastic coverings over the door hinges. However, there has not been disclosed to date, a hinge tape system which is able to efficiently and accurately cover a door hinge in a manner which does not interfere with the door's operation and/or prevent the covering from being damaged, disjointed or removed by operation of the door.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe current invention provides a hinge tape system which is efficiently applied by utilizing a system of a plurality of tape pieces that are pre-formed to protect the distinct portions of the hinge straps, the rotating portions of the hinge barrel in a non-adhered manner, and the top and bottom of the hinge pin when painting doors and frames. The current invention may be more efficiently used based on the pre-formed pieces being rolled in a tape style manner and perforated between the individual pieces. Further, the current hinge tape system includes a pre-formed piece which excludes adhesive from contacting the moving portions of the hinge barrel, thereby allowing continued un-obscured use of the door while maintaining full protection from paints and coating by the tape system.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 illustrates a first performed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 1a illustrates a door hinge having the top and bottom portions of the pin portion of the door hinge protected by first preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 1b illustrates a double door slide lock having entire surface protected by first preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 1c illustrates the first preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention stored in a pre-use form as a roll.FIG. 2 illustrates a back (second) surface of a second preformed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2a illustrates a front (first) surface of a second preformed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2b illustrates a door hinge as set forth in FIG. 1a further having the inner barrel portion of the door hinge protected by a second preformed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2c illustrates an outer barrel portion of a door hinge protected by a second pre-formed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2d illustrates the second preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention stored in a pre-use form as a roll.FIG. 3 illustrates a third preformed tape piece according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3a illustrates a door hinge as set forth in FIG. 2a further having the right and left strap portions of the door hinge protected by third preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3b illustrates the first preformed tape pieces according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention stored in a pre-use form as a roll.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises about three separate rolls of masking, with each roll comprising precut and perforated tape pieces to match distinct portions of the door hinge as needed to ensure adequate protection. The hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment provides preformed tape pieces to distinctly protect the hinge straps, the rotating portions of the barrel, and the hinge pins while maintaining full operability of the door and protection of the hinge.The first preformed tape piece comprises a masking having an adhesive on one side thereof. The first preformed tape piece is stored in a standard roll with perforations sized to match the area of the top and bottom exposed portions of the hinge pin. For example, for a standard residential door hinge, the first preformed tape piece is stored in a standard roll of about ¾″ with perforations about every 1½″. FIG. 1 illustrates the first preformed tape piece 1. The first preformed tape piece 1 comprises a first surface 1a which is free of adhesive. The first surface 1a faces outward from the hinge pin to provide protection from painting and coating. The second surface 1b faces inward for contact with the top and the bottom of the hinge pin and storage as a tape roll. The first surface 1a may also be provided with a mark along every perforation 1c. The first surface 1a may also be provided with the word PIN 1d stamped on the surface to assist the user in proper application of the tape system.FIG. 1a illustrates a hinge 4 wherein two separate pieces 1A/1B of the first preformed tape piece are applied to the exposed portion of the center of the hinge 4a. A first piece 1A is applied to the top of the center of the hinge 4a, so as to cover and thereby protect the upper most knuckle of the hinge and the top of the hinge pin. A second piece of the first preformed tape piece 1B is applied to the bottom of the center of the hinge 4a, so as to cover and thereby protect the lower most knuckle of the hinge and the bottom of the hinge pin.Also, as an aside, FIG. 1b illustrates a plurality of first preformed tape pieces 1, sized for use with a standard residential hinge, used to protect the slide lock 1e on the edge of a double door which are ¾″ wide and approximately 6″ long by removing about four of the first preformed tape pieces from the roll, and maintaining the perforation 1d between the pieces to completely cover the slide lock 1e. FIG. 1c illustrates the first preformed tape pieces 1 stored prior to use as a roll 10. The first preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape. Thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste product.The second preformed tape piece comprises a masking having an adhesive on only a part of one surface. For example, for a standard residential door hinge, the second preformed tape piece comprises a 2″ by 3½″ masking having an adhesive on only a part of one surface. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the second preformed tape piece 2 comprises a first surface 2a which is free of adhesive. The first surface 2a faces outward from the hinge to provide protection from painting and coating. The second surface 2b faces inward for contact with the hinge and storage as a tape roll. The second surface 2b has a “deadened” center 2c about ⅞″ wide which extends the full length of the second preformed tape piece 2. This deadened center 2c is free of adhesive whereas the remainder of the second surface 2b has adhesive applied thereto forming adhesive areas 2d. As illustrated in FIG. 2a, in order to assist the user in application of the second preformed tape piece 2 to the hinge 4, the first surface 2a maybe provided with a marking 2e to indicate the location of the deadened center 2c in relation to the adhesive areas 2d on the second surface 2b. The first surface 2a may also be provided with the word BARREL 2f stamped along the center between markings 2e to assist the user in proper application. The first surface 2a may also be provided with a mark 2g along the perforation to insure accuracy in tearing.FIG. 2b illustrates the second preformed tape piece 2 as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment to the interior center hinge portion 4a. The second preformed tape piece 2 overlays the hinge 4 so as to completely cover the interior center hinge portion 4a with the deadened center 2c of the second preformed tape piece 2. The second preformed tape piece 2 overlays end portions of the first preformed tape pieces 1A/1B. The adhesive areas 2d are applied to the inner portion of the hinge straps thereby securing the second preformed tape piece 2 to the hinge 4. Since the deadened center 2c of the second preformed tape piece 2 is free of adhesive, the tape piece 2 will not interfere with the rotating motion of the knuckles and pin of the hinge 4 when the door is in operation. Hence, the door will maintain un-obscured operation while the interior center hinge portion 4a is protected without adhesive pulling the tape piece 2 loose or disrupting the coverage by the tape piece 2 by contacting the knuckles or pin.FIG. 2c illustrates the second preformed tape piece 2 as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment to the exterior center hinge portion 4b. The second preformed tape piece 2 is applied over the exterior center hinge portion 4b on the opposite side of the door and frame as to the interior center hinge portion 4a. Similar to above, the deadened center 2c of the second preformed tape piece 2 is applied to the knuckle and pin portion comprising the exterior center hinge portion 4b so as to prevent adhesive from contacting these rotating portions of the door hinge 4. The adhesive areas 2d are applied to exterior exposed areas of the strap portion of the door hinge. These adhesive areas 2d are preferably tucked into the space between the door and the straps by any common means, such as a 5-in-1 tool or putty knife. Thereby, the exterior center hinge portion 4b is protected from paint and coating while maintaining un-obscured operation of the door and insuring that the second preformed tape piece 2 will remain in place even with repeated use of the door.FIG. 2d illustrates the second preformed tape piece 2 stored prior to use as a roll 20. The second preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape. Thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste product.FIG. 3 illustrates a third preformed tape piece 3 comprising a first surface 3a which is free of adhesive. The first surface 3a faces outward from the hinge to provide protection from painting and coating. The second surface 3b faces inward for contact with the hinge strap and storage as a tape roll. The third preformed tape piece 3 also consists of having preformed corners 3c/3d on opposite sides thereof to correspond to the exact shape of the door hinge strap to be covered. For example, a third preformed tape piece 3 for a standard residential hinge strap would have both ¼″ 3c and ⅝″ 3d rounded corners. The outer surface 3a may also be provided with the word STRAP 3e stamped on the surface to assist the user in proper application of the tape system. The surface 3a also provides a mark 3f along each perforation.FIG. 3a illustrates the third preformed tape piece 3 as applied in the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment. For example, for a standard residential door hinge, the third preformed tape piece is about 1½″ by 3½″ with a side thereof having adhesive to be placed on the outer strap portion of the exposed hinge 4. The third preformed tape piece 3 is applied to cover the interior exposed hinge strap portions and partially overlay the second preformed tape piece 2. This third tape piece 3 preferably has corresponding corners 3a/3b on one side thereof to conforming to the exact shape of the door hinge strap to be protected. The outer surface of piece 3 may also be provided with the word STRAP 3h stamped on the surface to assist the user in proper application of the tape system.The corners of the third preformed tape piece may be formed to match any two door hinge strap corners. Most preferable, the third preformed tape piece 3 is precut to fit either a door hinge strap with a radius of ¼″ or ⅝″. The majority of residential pre-hung door hinges have a ⅝″ radius cut, or less common, a ¼″ radius cut. In order to accommodate either of these hinge sizes, the third preformed tape piece is shaped so that one side of the masking has a ¼″ radius cut on the upper right corner and the same cut on the lower right corner. A ⅝″ radius cut is on the upper left corner and has the same cut on the lower left corner. Therefore, enabling not only this roll, but the entire kit to be used on two different radius hinges by simply rotating the third preformed tape piece to have the exterior corners match the exterior corners of the hinge strap. Still further, a square cut corner can be combined with either of the two rounded corners to correspond to a square cut hinge strap.As illustrated in FIG. 3b, illustrates the third preformed tape piece 3 stored prior to use as a roll 30. The third preformed tape pieces are adhered front surface to back surface as a standard roll of tape. Thus additional sheets for laminating the tape pieces to maintain the adhesive during prior use storage are not required thereby allowing efficient use with minimal waste product.As set forth above, the hinge tape system of the preferred embodiment utilizes a total of six preformed tape pieces, two each of the first, second and third preformed tape pieces, to cover a single door hinge. With the hinge tape system, the door maybe opened to the full limit of the hinge, or to a lesser degree, and the tape system will maintain full protection of the hinge. The pieces described above are designed so that each covers a particular portion of the surface of the hinge despite the position of the hinge. When the hinge plate, the hinge pin (upper and lower portion), and the barrel are covered using this system, there is no area of the door or frame that is restricted from an intended coating. Nor, is the hinge subject to paint overspray or paint splatters.The hinge tape system is not limited to three preformed tape pieces but may include other tape pieces or configurations which cover the exposed portions of a door hinge. For example, a fourth optional roll may also be included comprising a ¼″ tape to be used to protect the very top portion of the hinge straps that protrude from the recessed portion of the door and the door frame. However, as this area of the hinge is most commonly not visible, there is often no loss of aesthetic value by painting or coating this area.Further, the hinge tape system may be comprised of preformed tape pieces which match commercial hinges or other specially designed hinges.The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the present invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and applications shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be regarded as falling within the scope of the invention in the appended claims and their equivalents.

Pages: 288

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The books of 1 and 2 Samuel tell the story of an important time in Israel’s history: the beginning of the monarchy under Saul and the rise and reign of King David.

Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In contrast to literary and historical skepticism about the accounts of Israel and Judah in the divided kingdom, Provan examines 1 and 2 Kings as a unified and historical narrative. He helps the reader see that these books provide insight into the kings and prophets—and teach about God and his ways.


Iain W. Provan is the Marshall Sheppard Professor of Biblical Studies at Regent College. He is also an ordained minister of the Church of Scotland.

Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 512

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Job delves into questions as old as humanity and as contemporary as today’s headlines. How does God’s justice work? How are we to understand suffering? More importantly, how are we to respond to it? Through careful analysis and explanation of Job’s dialogue, Wilson sheds light on its core message: a call to faithfully persevere by entrusting the answers to God.

The Psalms are beloved for their poetic beauty, poignant expression of human emotion and spiritual experience, and soaring depictions of God’s glory. This commentary examines literary elements to help understand each psalm as a whole. Further, it highlights the psalms in their liturgical role as part of Israel’s worship, with an eye toward enriching contemporary worship and prayer.

Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 336

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The authors help you understand Hebrew thought expressed in wisdom literature and poetry. Murphy brings clarity to Proverbs via literary insight and intrabook connections. Huwiler sets Ecclesiastes in the larger biblical context and offers a reliable guide through this consideration of existence and meaning. He explores the rich imagery of Song of Songs—a celebration of the goodness of human sexuality and love.

Jeremiah, Lamentations

Author: Tremper Longman
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 432

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Jeremiah is a long and complex book written in the closing years of Judah before the exile. Longman provides clear and accessible commentary, drawing out covenant as a central theme: the people’s violation, the consequences, and the promise of a new covenant to come. He also provides solid help for understanding and applying the ancient genre of lament found in Lamentations.


Tremper Longman III is the Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California. Before coming to Westmont, he taught at Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia for 18 years. He has authored or coauthored numerous books, including An Introduction to the Old Testament, How to Read Proverbs, and commentaries on Daniel, Ecclesiastes, Proverbs, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Job, and Song of Songs.







Ezekiel

Author: Steven Tuell
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 384

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The modern reader encounters unfamiliar territory in Ezekiel, with its otherworldly visions and the peculiar actions of its author. Ezekiel presents a message of doom and judgment followed by an equally powerful message of hope and restoration. Through helpful literary analysis and theological reflection, Tuell assists the reader in seeing the richness and ongoing relevance of this book for today.


Steven Tuell is the James A. Kelso Associate Professor of Old Testament at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. He has authored a study of Ezekiel 40–48 in the Harvard Semitic Monographs series, as well as a commentary on 1 and 2 Chronicles in the Interpretation series. With John Strong, he coedited Constituting the Community: Studies on the Polity of Ancient Israel in Honor of S. Dean McBride, Jr.







Daniel

Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2012
Pages: 352

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




William Nelson’s section-by-section commentary on Daniel helps you navigate the sometimes-difficult terrain of this prophetical book.


William Nelson is a professor of Old Testament at Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California.







Minor Prophets, vol. 1

Author: Elizabeth Achtemeier
Publisher: Baker

This volume includes commentary on the first six books of the Minor Prophets: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah. Though varied in setting, style, audience, and theme, these books share at least one commonality: each is an important message from God. With interpretive skill and theological passion, Achtemeier helps the reader see the importance of these messages for today.


Elizabeth Achtemeier was an adjunct professor of Bible and homiletics at Union Theological Seminary in Virginia. She is the author of a number of books, including Nature, God, and Pulpit and Preaching from the Old Testament.







Minor Prophets, vol. 2

Author: John Goldingay and Pamela Scalise
Publisher: Baker

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This volume includes commentary on the second six books of the Minor Prophets: Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. With clear writing and technical expertise, the authors skillfully navigate the various interpretive challenges these books present, helping the reader understand and apply these ancient messages from God in today’s world.


John Goldingay is David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California. He is ordained in the Episcopal Church and is the author of numerous books, including Old Testament Theology volumes 1–3 and commentaries on Daniel, the Psalms, and Isaiah.
Pamela Scalise is an associate professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary, Seattle Campus. She is the author, with Gerald Keown and Thomas Smothers, of Jeremiah 26–52.

Product Description▼▲
Ezekiel is a transitional character writing in times of dramatic change. A priest without a temple, called to the prophetic office; an exile without a country, writing to his fellow exiles; a public figure for a while without a voice, Ezekiel composes a magnum opus that touched the hearts and minds of his generation and a work that continues to speak of the power and love of God more than two thousand years later.Steven Tuell has captured the breadth and depth of the man and his profound recognition of the power and grace of God for a disenfranchised community. He has provided clear understanding of a complex book of the Bible that many in the past have found confusing and murky. He clarifies the theological underpinnings of the text and brings the brilliance of this book into the light. His explanation of the visionary closing chapters of the book that center on a new nation and a new center of worship is cogent and clear.The New International Biblical Commentary offers the best of contemporary scholarship in a format that both general readers and serious students can use with profit. Based on the widely used New International Version translation the NIBC presents careful section-by-section exposition with key terms and phrases highlighted and all Hebrew transliterated. A separate section of notes at the close of each chapter provides additional textual and technical comments. Each commentary also includes a selected bibliography as well as Scripture and subject indexes.
