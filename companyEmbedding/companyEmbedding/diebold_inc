Diebold Nixdorf (pronounced "DEE-bold NIX-dorf") is an American financial self-service, security and services corporation[4] internationally engaged primarily in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction systems (such as ATMs), electronic and physical security products (including vaults and currency processing systems), software and related services for global financial and commercial markets.[5] Founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company,[7] after becoming incorporated in Ohio in 1876[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Currently headquartered in the Akron-Canton area with facilities in nearby Green,[9][10] in 1921 Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold has since branched into diverse markets, and is currently the largest provider of ATMs in the United States.[5][11] With 2015 revenues of US$2.42 billion,[1] Diebold Nixdorf was founded when Diebold Inc. merged with Germany's Wincor Nixdorf in 2016.[3] It is estimated that Diebold Nixdorf controls about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]

Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]
Computer security and ATMs (1960s-1990s)[edit]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]
Computer security and ATMs (1960s-1990s)[edit]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]
Computer security and ATMs (1960s-1990s)[edit]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]

Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]

The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]

Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

In a new whitepaper from Retail Touchpoints, our VP of Retail outlines the key to today’s checkout line and offers some benefits of enhancing your solutions.

The Branch Conundrum
10/12/2016









                On the Blog: Let’s Change the Conversation
                    

Did you catch the recent article on the shift in branch numbers from the Financial Brand? In it, they argue that the market has essentially “reset” itself over the past 10 years, after a flurry of branches were opened … that maybe shouldn’t have been opened. This chart highlights the equalizing effect of openings and closings between 2006 and 2016. Pretty interesting when you look at the first and last columns! 

Our VP of Advisory Services, Raja Bose, recognizes that regardless of how many branches are out there, their focus needs to change. It’s a point he outlines in his most recent blog.

        Chatter about cryptocurrency rides the media news circuit like a feather on a strong breeze – up, down, in, out, predictable in its unpredictability. As the industry explores the capabilities and opportunities for bitcoin, the blockchain and other emerging cryptocurrencies, it’s clear that, for now at least, there are more questions than answers. Our VP of Software Research & Strategy offers a quick primer.                    










The “Regtech” Advantage
10/3/2016









                Banking Regtechs to the Rescue?
                    

How does your organization manage compliance? It’s a challenge that is only predicted to get bigger, driving the rise of so-called “regtech” firms. Bain & Co. outlines regtech benefits in a new report – and our VP of Managed Services for the Americas, Tim Witt, says it’s something financial institutions (FIs) should be exploring sooner rather than later. 

“Without question, FIs are realizing there are an ever growing number of individuals and organizations working to breach their organization – and if they allow consumer information to be breached, it’s going to hurt them. In many ways, the number-one benefit of their ‘brand’ is that they’re secure. Collaborating with firms like Diebold Nixdorf can help FIs ensure they’re doing everything they need to keep consumer data safe.”

                Six Illusions Execs Have About Big Data
                    

How does your organization view the almighty “big data”? A new article from Entrepreneur explores the misconceptions and truths around the topic; we asked our Global Product Manager, Karan Oberoi, to weigh in. 

Big data isn’t a buzzword anymore,” notes Oberoi. “It’s all around us – and each one of us, living in this digital age, is a regular consumer and producer of big data. In the financial world, banks globally are opening up to the potential of unlocking value from big data. The best part? Banks already have all the data!”

Branch Transformation with “The Crowd”

Our Commitment to Our Customers
9/23/2016







Have you heard about our TAG conference, an annual event that draws regional and community financial institutions from across North America to discuss the challenges and industry trends that are most relevant to their market segment? 

Held in Arlington, Va. this year, members of our leadership panel were on hand for seminars, panels and individual sessions that yielded some fascinating conversations. “We host this annual conference so our leaders can connect one-on-one with customers,” said Nakisha Garner, director, field marketing, who was onsite at the event. “The biggest message we delivered is that we are approaching our clients as a business partner to deliver innovative solutions that resolve their specific issues and enable them to be more competitive in the marketplace, grow revenue and satisfy their consumers.” 










Some ATMs to Disappear?
9/22/2016









                Why that scuzzy ATM in the back of your favorite dive bar is about to disappear
                    

EMV is hot right now – for many, many reasons. Our Senior Director of Core Software and ATM Security was interviewed by Marketwatch recently about the challenge of upgrading independent ATMs to be EMV compliant. 

“Compliance often drives change and investment in the financial sector,” Billett points out. “EMV is one of those industry requirements that affects the hardware and software on the ATM.  Depending on the business model for the ATM, it may be difficult to justify the cost of the upgrade versus ongoing revenue.”

Does this represent an opportunity for your organization?

Don’t Wait for Mr. Perfect
9/19/2016









                Five Ways You’re Sabotaging Your Branch Transformation
                    

        “There is never going to be a ‘perfect’ time to initiate your branch transformation. Likewise, new technology and new ideas will never stop hitting the market; if you wait for ‘the one’ that will solve all your organization’s woes, you risk the market passing you by,” writes our Advisory Services Manager, Brett Rumble, in his latest blog post. We all like to talk about ways to make sure branch transformation strategies succeed – but we can’t ignore the tough challenges that can make failure a real possibility. Make sure your eyes are wide open before you jump in.                    










The Cashless Fairytale
9/16/2016









                Is Cash Disappearing? The Myth of the Cashless Society
                    

There’s always another study about the emergence of cashless societies – but at least for now, it remains more of a fairytale than a true reality. With 85% of global transactions conducted in cash, cashless proponents still have a long road ahead of them. Granted, cash usage is decreasing at a rate of about 1% per year, and there very well may come a time when cash is no longer “king.” That’s why we build solutions that recognize both current-state needs and emerging industry trends, so you have the tools you need to succeed no matter where currency goes next. 










Three is the Magic Number
9/15/2016









                The Three Sides of the Omnichannel Coin
                    

How are you preparing your organization for the digital transformation that’s affecting every facet of the retail environment? If your teams are siloed, or your approach is fragmented, you could be missing a critical component of your digital retail strategy.

Strategic foresight consultant Thimon de Jong spoke at our annual In Touch conference today in Stockholm, exploring the ways technology is influencing our daily behaviors and how it will impact us in the future. We love this conference because it’s an opportunity to connect directly with organizations across the financial and retail verticals, and it provides a forum for industry stakeholders to meet and share their experiences, ideas and views on the current and future transformation needs of our industries.  










Cleaner Cash is Coming
9/13/2016









                Britain’s biggest cash revolution in decades, all yours for a fiver
                    

The big news in good old-fashioned currency this week is the 440 million polymer five-euro notes being distributed by the Bank of England, and coming soon to bank branches and ATMs throughout London and Wales. Bloomberg interviewed our CEO, Andy Mattes, about the impending change earlier this year, and he revealed an unexpected benefit of the new notes. “The polymer bills collect far less dust than paper money, which can leave the interior of cash machines filthy. When technicians currently go to fix an ATM, ‘the tool they often need is a vacuum cleaner,’ he said.”

The new bills are also more difficult to counterfeit – and they’re well past the beta stage. Both Canada and Australia have already begun implementing “plastic” bills. This new article from the Guardian sorts out the details of the new euro.

        Chatter about cryptocurrency rides the media news circuit like a feather on a strong breeze – up, down, in, out, predictable in its unpredictability. As the industry explores the capabilities and opportunities for bitcoin, the blockchain and other emerging cryptocurrencies, it’s clear that, for now at least, there are more questions than answers.

Data Mining: Cool or Creepy? 
9/12/2016









                The Four Imperatives to Winning in the Age of the Customer
                    

A new article from American Banker delves into the tricky topic of data mining in the financial industry – a common practice already in many industries, but made difficult by the very different standard to which consumers hold their financial institutions. 

The article makes a good point that data mining should always be consumer-driven, not revenue-driven. Why? Because as we explored in an article on our own blog, we’re living in The Age of the Customer. 










ATM, What’s Your Function?
9/9/2016









                More Power to the ATM
                    

We’re living in a world where everything and everyone has to do more. Look at our smartphones: they’re also our cameras, personal assistants, memory banks and more. Of course consumers want an ATM that can do more for them – and we know you want to improve consumer experiences. But it can be tough getting started. 

In our latest blog post, our software product management director, Shelly Ewing, highlights some ways you can identify potential opportunities and kick-start implementation within your own organization. 










Webinar: Eyes on Your ATM Inventory

                Learn How Accurate Fleet Inventory Data Can Save You Time and Money
                    

78% of financial institutions track their ATM fleet manually, rely on hardware vendors or simply don't know what's going on with their ATM inventory. Just think what they’re missing!

If this sounds like your organization, join our software product manager, Cijal Raj, as he explores common ATM fleet inventory challenges and identifies the solutions, architecture and technical requirements that can enable better insights into your self-service fleet.  










Cloud Control: Dissecting SaaS
9/7/2016









                25 Fastest Growing Cloud Companies
                    

Is the cloud on your horizon? You probably have many questions about how the model – and potential software partners – can work for your organization. This new report from PwC discusses the trend of more software companies offering SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and other cloud-driven implementations. It also takes a deep dive into the intricacies of working with software vendors on implementation, and outlines the opportunities and challenges. 

“Cloud business models allow customers to deploy software projects at a much lower risk,” notes our VP of Retail Software, Lars Wiesner, in the article. “The risk is not just lower for IT, but for the business units as well. Without any capital investment, a small number of users can try out software before a broader rollout.”  










Today’s Grain of Salt
9/6/2016









                Branch Transformation Strategy Development: A Science and An Art
                    

We’re just returning from the Labor Day holiday weekend here in the U.S. As summer fades and we focus on how we can best serve our clients moving forward, we’re enjoying this recent read from American Banker about the many (often contradictory) preferences of millennials.  

We all love a good stat, but hinging your strategy on any one number or proof point – no matter how provocative – means you’re not looking at the whole picture. Alternatively, our branch transformation consultants encourage a holistic, comprehensive approach that recognizes millennials – and every other group – can’t be lumped into broad generalizations.  










Retail: Stores Still Matter
9/2/2016









                The Top Three Trends Driving Retail Transformation
                    

Today, it’s all about balance. Your physical stores are a vital component of an omnichannel strategy – now is the time to think holistically about your channels, says our Retail SVP, Thomas Fell. 










When “Ubiquitous” Doesn’t Apply …

“Much is made of the ubiquity of the Internet,” notes our product manager for portfolio development within global self-service hardware, Keith Burwell. “How did we ever get along before the ability to Instagram our post-workout latte pics? We are the connected collective. Which is why mobile and web banking are making such strong headway in the market. It only makes sense, right?  

“Until you realize that LESS than HALF of the world’s population has access to the Internet. Hashtag (#truestory). According to this chart, only 47% of worldwide inhabitants have the ability to post a daily selfie. The number is even worse when you look at regional data. Once again, financial access becomes a problem. If half of the world can’t get online, they need to find access to banking services in some other way.
This is where we come in. We’re working on solutions to provide villages and rural global citizens with the ability to gain access – not only to cash, but to financial services – in order to raise buying power, leverage small business loans, and create wealth. See my post on the topic here.  

So the next time you use your phone to Apple Pay for your #streettaco or just check your balance, remember you are one of the lucky half. Diebold Nixdorf is working hard for the rest.”

Consumers’ demands are becoming more and more similar around the globe, notes our Head of Industry Marketing, Retail, Sabine Gruen. This is the right time for the emergence of global brands, and a trigger for retailers to expand their business into new geographical markets and address a bigger audience.

"For highest efficiency,  they should multiply approved store concepts, relying on scalable IT infrastructure, standardized processes and of course on a team that transfers the central strategy into local markets and every single store." Her findings are backed by a recent report from Deloitte, which says, "International expansion – including stand-alone stores, department store concessions and e-commerce – continued to be an important driver of sales and profits.” Read the entire white paper.

Industry leader in cross-channel software, Phoenix broadens Diebold's capabilities -- maximizing the company's branch automation solutions around the globe
NORTH CANTON, Ohio, March 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Diebold, Incorporated (NYSE:   DBD) today announced it has acquired Phoenix Interactive Design, Inc., a world leader in developing innovative software solutions for automated teller machines (ATMs) and a host of other financial self-service applications. 
Headquartered in London, Ontario, Phoenix brings more than 25 years of banking industry experience by creating highly configurable, enterprise-wide software that automates and migrates financial services across channels -- changing the way financial products are delivered to consumers through technology.  Phoenix's customers include some of the world's most prominent financial institutions (FIs), including TD Canada Trust, National Australia Bank Group and Fifth Third Bank.  
"Diebold's acquisition of Phoenix is an important milestone in our drive to transform to a services-led, software enabled company," said Andy W. Mattes, Diebold president and chief executive officer. "There are many synergies between our companies.  We will integrate the talent of the Phoenix team and take advantage of our reach to expand the Phoenix solution in more global markets.  Acquiring Phoenix is a key foundational move to accelerate our growth in the fast-growing managed services and branch automation spaces."
The expertise and proven capabilities Phoenix provides will allow Diebold to offer a stronger, more compelling software solution that complements the company's existing services and security expertise.  Phoenix delivers a comprehensive offering with a consistent, user-friendly interface across the self-service channel and a FI's entire banking ecosystem -- regardless of the vendor hardware environment.
Alan Kerr, Diebold executive vice president, software, will lead the Phoenix operation, which will serve as the foundation of Diebold's software business moving forward. Phoenix has approximately 200 employees, who will be retained as part of Diebold.  Kyle MacDonald, chief executive officer of Phoenix, is retiring from the self-service industry and will remain active during the integration for a period of time to ensure a seamless transition.  
"Phoenix enables Diebold to move further up the value chain, with broader architectural capabilities and expanded competencies in banking transformation," Kerr said. "Coupling Phoenix with our global reach and resources, we expect Diebold to be a more integral partner in meeting FI demands for software functionality and ease of use, as well as ongoing demands in security and availability."  
Kyle MacDonald, chief executive officer, Phoenix Interactive Design, said, "I am confident that Diebold will bring tremendous growth opportunities for the Phoenix team, and will add impressive value to Phoenix's clients." 
Financial terms of the acquisition are not being immediately disclosed.
