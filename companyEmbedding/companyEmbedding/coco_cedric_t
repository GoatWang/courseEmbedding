From Employed ... to Engaged: Lowe's Harnesses Employee Engagement to Drive Business Results and Customer Satisfaction 
By Coco, Cedric T.

Article excerpt

  Regardless of whether you sell home improvement supplies or compete for customers in another industry, the benefits that come from an engaged workforce are a competitive differentiator and should be a critical objective.    The research is undeniable: Gallup estimates disengaged employees cost the U.S. economy as much as $350 billion a year; the United Kingdom, $64.8 billion a year; and in Japan, $232 billion yearly.    Research finds that between 15 percent and 20 percent of employees in the workforce today are "actively disengaged," and are dragging down key performance indicators with their poor customer interactions, increased sick days, and lower productivity.    Gallup research shows that at average companies, about 30 percent of employees are engaged. Lowe's is not an average company. At Lowe's, more than half of our employees are classified not only as engaged, but also as fans of the company. This is a source of pride and a strategic objective that we diligently work to maintain.    Establishing the link between employees and customers    Our mantra sounds like the mantra of so many successful corporations: employees are the lifeblood pulsing through our operations. Yet according to the research figures above, Lowe's has successfully tapped a level of employee engagement that seems to have eluded many others.    For Lowe's, employee engagement is key for a number of reasons. The holistic combination of employee engagement and customer satisfaction has a predictive effect on financial performance. Our research shows us that in stores where employee engagement levels increased, overall sales for those stores jumped proportionally.    Stores where employees report higher levels of engagement have improved performance. Even in very busy stores where higher-than-average sales per employee would normally pull down customer satisfaction scores, our research found that having highly engaged employees slows or halts this effect. Of course, when engagement falls, the opposite occurs.    [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]    Measuring engagement is one of the ways we gauge the commitment of our workforce. Admittedly, our workforce hasn't always been so engaged. And now that the majority is, we face the new challenge of maintaining employee engagement in the long term.    The retail environment today is constantly changing. Customer expectations and their priorities of what's important seem to shift almost weekly. While price and value drive decisions one week, customer service and product offerings may shape choices the next. Being able to anticipate and react to such shifts drives sales and customer satisfaction.    But true business success doesn't stop with customer satisfaction. We also must understand today's workforce dynamics and figure out what values, needs, and desires drive our employees. After all, our 220,000 employees not only have the power to influence shopper experiences and purchases, they also are consumers.    At Lowe's, fully visualizing and understanding our workforce is more challenging than at any other time in history. Today, members of multiple generations work side by side in our stores. Not only does each generation have its own expectations from Lowe's as an employer, but within each generation exists a wide range of opinions and desires shaped by culture, upbringing, geography, socioeconomic status, and more.    [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]    On top of that, the "psychological contract" employees have with employers has evolved as well. Employees no longer think about joining a company for life. Rather, they move between employers in search of the values they hold highest at the moment, such as more money, career opportunities, job flexibility, and work-life balance.    Applying advanced analytics for employee research    Building a culture of engaged employees begins with our executive team. As Lowe's Chairman and CEO Robert Niblock has aptly said, "To be successful, we must win trust with our customers, and that means enabling and empowering our employees to earn that trust. …
