                                                            Frequently Asked Questions                                                  


Where can I purchase Garner data elimination equipment?
You can purchase directly from us or through our extensive network of dealers and distributors around the world. For more information, contact us by email at info@garner-products.com or by phone at 800-624-1903.
Are the magnetic field generated by your degaussers safe?
According to the results of a multiyear study by the World Health Organization (WHO), “Despite extensive research, to date there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to human health.” In addition, the amount of magnetic field exposure to people 12 to 18 inches away from a Garner degausser is extremely low, approximately 1/120th of the limit recommended by the American Conference of Industrial Hygienists, the scientific body that issues exposure recommendations for magnetic emissions. For more information, download our white paper, Magnetic Fields Discussion. Magnetic Fields Discussion white paper
Why is degaussing considered to be the best way to erase data from hard drives and tapes?
Degaussing eliminates data physically (not via software) from the hard drive platters or from tape film by producing a magnetic field sufficient to neutralize the magnetic particles.  Sanitation methods such as overwriting, secure erase, shredding, physical destruction or encryption leave data that could potentially be recovered through software or laboratory methods available now or in the near future.  Degaussing with a machine that produces sufficient field strength produces permanent erasure. Data on degaussed media is gone and cannot be recovered with existing or future technology. Visit our White Paper section for more in-depth information about the degaussing process.
Will degaussing erase data contained on solid-state hard drives (SSDs) used in laptops and tablets, flash drives, USB thumb drives, etc.?
No, solid state drives and other flash media do not use magnetic technology to store data. Instead, the data is stored on memory chips, which must be physically destroyed.  Piercing the drives to break the chips eliminates data, as long as all chips are destroyed.

We offer a wide selection of accessories that allow you to tailor your data elimination process to meet your specific needs.
SSD-1 Solid-State Destroyer



Add to the PD-5 to create the ultimate destruction package. Ensures secure destruction of data stored on solid-state drives, including laptop SSDs and solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs), as well as flash, compact flash, thumb, and other USB drives. The piercing power of 90 spikes punctures from top and bottom to perforate and waffle media, demolishing the individual memory chips preventing data from being retrieved.

SSD-CADDY



Keep your PD-5 accessories in one place. Add the SSD-CADDY  to create a compact, organized, and stable destruction accessory station. The SSD-CADDY securely locks into the base of the PD-5 to conveniently hold the SSD-1 solid-state destroyer and the SSD-MT solid-state media transport sleeves.

For those who occasionally dispose of hard drives and solid-state media but are not ready to invest in degaussing and destruction equipment, our total data erasure and media destruction services offer easy and affordable alternatives.
View PDF Brochure

Depending on your location, we offer two convenient degaussing and destruction service options to help you meet government, industry, and corporate data-security standards (listed below):

On-Site Data-Elimination Service – Our mobile data destruction team or an authorized local partner brings degaussing and destruction to you. The team can degauss (magnetically erase) all hard drives and tape media. They can also physically destroy hard drives and solid-state media, including flash, compact flash, and USB thumb drives, as well as the controller boards of hybrid-drive systems.  As they process each piece of media, our service technicians use our SCAN-1 scanner and software package to create an audit-worthy Media Destruction Report for your records.
Shipment-Based Services – If you’re located outside our mobile service region, you can take advantage of our shipping program to send in tapes, hard drives, and solid-state memory devices destined for disposal. We’ll provide full data erasure and media destruction, along with an audit-worthy Media Destruction Report for your records. Once processing is complete, we can dispose of the destroyed media or return it to you for proof of destruction.

State-of-the-art equipment. Best-in-class service.
Since 1959, we’ve been delivering prompt, personalized service and innovative products that serve our customers’ needs. Today, we manufacture a complete line of tape and hard drive degaussers and physical drive destroyers that ensure data security for a growing list of Fortune 500 companies. Whether we’re bring the equipment to you or you’re shipping the media to us, we’ll match your media and security needs by selecting equipment that delivers the speed, power, and media range you need.
Guaranteed Erasure and Media Destruction

Thorough – Eliminates all data from your media, keeping you safe from potential security breaches and legal complications. We furnish an electronically generated NIST-compliant destruction report for each job.
Easy – Requires nothing more than a phone call (for on-site service) or shipping. We take care of the media erasure and destruction for you and provide you with destroyed media and a complete report.
Versatile – Offers the only solution for destroying solid-state media and erasing data from laptop, desktop and network hard drives, including drives that are damaged and/or not functioning.
Cost Effective – Provides the most secure data elimination for a fraction of the cost of other methods.
Compliant – Eliminates chain-of-custody issues while helping you satisfy the most stringent government and industry standards, including:

California Senate Bill 1386
FCC
GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)
HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability Act)

HD-3WXL Degausser
(Hard Drive & Tape)










 








Our most innovative degausser, the HD-3WXL delivers a wish list of practical features and options. Compact and easy-to-use, the HD-3WXL is a high-speed, high-volume degausser that fully and permanently erases all data contained on high-coercivity (magnetic) hard drives and tape media—with no adapters needed. The HD-3WXL includes a USB port that enables you to take advantage of our optional SCAN-1 scanner and software package to create an audit-worthy media destruction report as you degauss.

Small Footprint. Big Advantages.



Fast
With its continuous-duty rating, the HD-3WXL can erase up to 3600 drives or tapes per hour (7,200 a day) with no cool down needed.


Verified
Independently certified to meet both CE and ANSI safety and compatibility standards worldwide. Built-in safeguards check the stored power and display the field strength during each erase cycle, ensuring complete erasure.


Report capable
Allows you to add our optional SCAN-1 scanner and destruction report software package to scan hard drive serial numbers to create a media destruction report during the degaussing process.






Versatile
Erases all hard drive and tape formats that fit into the 1.7 x 4.5 x 5.9 in. media slot.


Automatic
The degauss cycle starts as soon as you insert the media into the slot. Once erasure is successfully completed and verified by internal safeguards, the HD-3WXL releases the media down the exit slide.


Practical
Plugs into standard wall outlets in offices around the world.


Compact
Takes up less than a square foot of floor space and weighs just 66 lbs.






Quiet
Offers an ideal, low-noise solution for office environments.


Compliant
Enables you to meet government mandates that require complete elimination of sensitive information stored on magnetic media prior to re-use (tape only) or disposal.






Permanent Erasure Means Data Is Gone Forever
Because the HD-3WXL provides high-powered magnetic erasure, degaussed data can never be recovered. Magnetic erasure also means there’s no software to buy, update, or upgrade. And the HD-3WXL technology used to erase magnetic hard drives and tape media will never become obsolete due to software or driver modifications.
Degauss vs. Overwrite
The HD-3WXL produces an erasing field many times stronger than the fields produced by the read/write heads in hard drives and tape drives. This achieves a deeper and more efficient erasure than software-based wiping programs. Unlike overwriting, the HD-3WXL generates an erase field that encompasses the entire hard drive, leaving no area unchanged. Since the HD-3WXL does not rely on software and requires no physical connection to the hard drive, such as a cable, it completely and permanently erases working and nonworking hard drives, regardless of the operating system or interface.
Secure and Compliant
The HD-3WXL will assist you in satisfying government and industry data standards, including:


California Senate Bill 1386
DOD Up to Secret Classification
FCC
GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)
HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability Act)
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Guidelines for Media Sanitization
NIST SP 800-36
NIST SP 800-88r1
PCI DSS 3.2 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)

 
Erasure-Cerification Tests
Hard drives erased with the HD-3WXL have been tested and verified by hard drive manufacturers, information recovery companies, and private forensic laboratories, which independently confirmed that no data was recoverable.
International Standards
The HD-3WXL is independently tested and certified to meet CE and ANSI safety and compatibility standards worldwide.

HD-3WXL Practical Versatility –Optional Packages and Accessories
The HD-3WXL lets you configure a system to match your operations. We offer everything you need to create a floor, desktop, or mobile workspace. The HD-3WXL also comes equipped with a USB port so that you can add our most popular option, the SCAN-1 scanner and destruction report software package that lets you scan and upload hard-drive serial numbers to automatically log degaussed drives and generate a media destruction report. For even greater disposal security, add our NSA/CSS EPL-listed PD-4 Hard Drive Destroyer that bends, breaks, and mangles hard drives or our NSA/CSS EPL-listed PD-5 Hard Drive and Solid-State Destroyer that crushes magnetic, solid-state, flash, and thumb drives.
