Item 4. Purpose of Transaction. 
Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
The information set forth in Item 6 of this Statement is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
The Reporting Person holds the Common Stock for investment purposes. In its capacity as a significant stockholder of the Issuer, the Reporting
Person intends to take an active role in working with the Issuers management on operational, financial and strategic initiatives. As a result of Seth A. Meisels resignation from the Issuers board of directors (and the
committees thereof) on November 4, 2015, no member of the board of managers of UWWH currently serves on the Issuers board of directors. The Reporting Person reviews and intends to continue to review, on an ongoing and continuing basis,
its investment in the Issuer. Depending upon the factors discussed below and subject to applicable law and the agreements described in Item 6 below, including that described under the heading Registration Rights Agreement, the Reporting
Person may from time to time acquire additional securities of the Issuer or sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of its securities of the Issuer. Any transactions that the Reporting Person may pursue may be made at any time and from time to time
without prior notice and will depend upon a variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices of the securities of the Issuer, the financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer,
general economic, financial market and industry conditions, other investment and business opportunities available to the Reporting Person, tax considerations and other factors. 
Other than as described above, or in Item 6 of this Statement, the Reporting Person currently has no plans or proposals that relate to or
would result in any of the transactions involving the Issuer described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D (although the Reporting Person may from time to time consider pursuing or proposing any such transactions and, in that
connection, may discuss, evaluate and/or pursue any such transactions with their advisors, the Issuer or other persons).  Item 5. Interest in
Securities of the Issuer.  Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 
(a)-(b) As the date hereof, the Reporting Person holds sole voting and dispositive power over 6,083,840 shares, or approximately 38.8%, of
Common Stock.  Voting and dispositive power with respect to the shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Person is exercised through a
three-member board of managers acting by majority vote. Fund VII and Coinvestment VII have the right to appoint two of the three members of the board of managers of the Reporting Person. In addition, Fund VII LLC, Coinvest VII LLC, BCIP III LLC,
BCIP T III LLC, BCIP III-B LLC, BCIP T III-B LLC and J5 (the Bain Capital Funds) collectively hold common equity interests of the Reporting Person. 
BCI is the general partner of BCP VII, which is the general partner of Coinvestment VII and Fund VII, which is the managing member of J5.
Boylston Coinvestors, LLC is the managing partner of BCIP Trust Associates III, BCIP Trust Associates III-B, BCIP Associates III and BCIP Associates III-B, which is the manager of BCIP T III LLC, BCIP T III-B LLC, BCIP III LLC and BCIP III-B LLC,
respectively. The investment strategy and decision-making process with respect to investments held by the Bain Capital Funds is directed by BCIs Global Private Equity Board. 
(c) Except for the transactions described in this Statement, including those described in Item 6 below, there have been no transactions in
Common Shares that were effected during the past sixty days by the Reporting Person. To the knowledge of the Reporting Person, no other person or entity referred to in Item 2 (including those listed on Schedule A hereto) has effected any transaction

(d) Except as stated within this Item 5, to the knowledge of the Reporting Person, only the
Reporting Person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of Common Stock of the Issuer reported by this Statement. 
(e) Not applicable.  Item 6. Contracts,
Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to the Securities of the Issuer  Item 6 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and
supplemented as follows:  Underwriting Agreement and Lock-up Agreement 
Pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the Underwriting Agreement), dated as of November 17, 2016 by and among the Issuer, UWWH and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein (the Underwriters), UWWH agreed to sell to the Underwriter in an underwritten public offering an aggregate of 1,756,160
shares of Common Stock (the Public Offering). The sale of the Common Stock to the Underwriter closed on November 23, 2016. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Issuer repurchased from the Underwriters
313,600 of the shares of Common Stock that were the subject of the Public Offering at a price per share equal to the price at which the Underwriters purchased such shares from UWWH in the Public Offering (the Share Repurchase). The
313,600 shares of Common Stock acquired by the Issuer in connection with the Share Repurchase will no longer be outstanding.  In
connection with the Public Offering, UWWH and directors and executive officers of the Issuer entered into a lock-up agreement (the Lock-up Agreement) with the Underwriter. Under the Lock-up Agreement, each party to the Lock-up Agreement
agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to sell or transfer any Common Stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, exercisable for, or repayable with Common Stock, for 60 days after November 17, 2016 without first obtaining the
written consent of the Underwriter.  The summaries of the Underwriting Agreement and Lock-up Agreement contained in this Item 6 are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement, each of which is filed as an exhibit hereto and incorporated by reference herein. 
Item 7. Materials to be Filed as Exhibits  Item 7 of
the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:   









Exhibit 7
  
Underwriting Agreement, dated November 17, 2016, by and among the Issuer, UWWH and the Underwriter (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 1.1 to the Issuers Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 to Form S-3 on Form S-1 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on November 15, 2016).




Exhibit 8

forth in Section 2.3(c) based on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and on the basis of a Physical Inventory and reconciliation in accordance with GAAP taken as close as practicable to the Closing Date (but in any case
relating to the last completed fiscal month of the Company prior to the Closing Date and rolled forward to the Closing Date) and shall be accompanied by a report of the independent auditors who shall audit such balance sheet) (the Closing
Balance Sheet) as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Together with the Closing Balance Sheet, GP shall also furnish to Buyer a report showing current items only (the Preliminary Adjustment Report), prepared as
set forth in Section 2.3(c) on the basis of the Closing Balance Sheet, stating in reasonable detail GPs computation of (i) the Working Capital Amount as of the close of business on the Closing Date (Adjusted Working
Capital), (ii) the amount of Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures (Adjusted Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures) and (iii) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business
on the Closing Date (Adjusted Indebtedness). The Preliminary Adjustment Report shall also show GPs computation of the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration. The Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration
shall be equal to (i) the Base Contribution Cash Consideration, plus (ii) an amount, which may be negative, obtained by subtracting the Working Capital Target from the Adjusted Working Capital minus (iii) the amount, if any, by which
Target Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures exceed the Adjusted Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures (the CapEx Difference) and minus (iv) Adjusted Indebtedness. GP shall allow the Buyer and its advisors and accountants to observe
the Physical Inventory taken in connection with preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Preliminary Adjustment Report. Unless the Buyer provides specific written notice to GP of an objection to any aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report
before the close of business on the first business day that is at least sixty days after the Buyers receipt thereof, the Preliminary Adjustment Report shall then become binding upon the Buyer and GP, and shall be the Final Adjustment
Report, and such business day shall be the Final Adjustment Report Date. In connection with the review of the Preliminary Adjustment Report, each of GP and the Buyer shall cooperate and grant to the others
respective advisors and accountants reasonable access to such papers and documents as each may reasonably request as part of the review of the Preliminary Adjustment Report. In the event that either party is unable to provide any information, papers
or documents within five days after a request by the other, the time for Buyer to respond to the Preliminary Adjustment Report shall be extended one business day for each additional day required for the other party to respond to such request (unless
waived by the party requesting such information, papers or documents). If the Buyer, by written notice to GP before the close of business on such business day after any such extension, objects to any aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report, then
those aspects as to which the objection was made shall not become binding, the Buyer and GP shall discuss such objection in good faith and, if they reach written agreement amending the Preliminary  
14 


 Adjustment Report, the
Preliminary Adjustment Report, as amended by such written agreement, shall become binding upon the Buyer and GP, and shall be the Final Adjustment Report, and the date of such written agreement shall be the Final
Adjustment Report Date. If the Buyer and GP do not reach such written agreement within thirty days after the Buyer gives such notice of objection, those aspects as to which such objection was made shall be submitted for arbitration by
Deloitte & Touche (the Accounting Firm), which shall arbitrate the dispute and submit a written statement of its adjudication, which statement, when delivered to the Buyer and to GP, shall address only those items which are in
dispute and become binding upon the Buyer and GP, and shall, together with those aspects of the Preliminary Adjustment Report as to which no objection was made, be the Final Adjustment Report. In such case, the second business day
after the date on which such statement is delivered to the Buyer and to GP shall be the Final Adjustment Report Date. The Buyer and GP shall direct the Accounting Firm to complete its arbitration within forty-five days, or any
longer period as agreed to by the Buyer and GP. The Accounting Firm shall allocate its costs and expenses between Newco and GP based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. In acting hereunder, the Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.  (b) On the Final Adjustment Report Date, (i) if the Final Adjustment Report states that the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration is
less than the Closing Contribution Cash Consideration, GP shall pay to Newco no later than three business days after the Final Adjustment Report Date, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to (A) the excess of the Closing Contribution Cash
Consideration over the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration, each as specified in the Final Adjustment Report (such excess, the Contribution Cash Consideration Deficiency Amount), plus (B) interest computed at the Prime Rate
plus 100 basis points for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment on the Contribution Cash Consideration Deficiency Amount less the amount of such Contribution Cash Consideration Deficiency Amount attributable to the CapEx
Difference and Adjusted Indebtedness, plus (C) interest computed at the borrowing costs of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment on such portion of the Contribution Cash
Consideration Deficiency Amount attributable to the CapEx Difference and Adjusted Indebtedness or (ii) if the Final Adjustment Report states that the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration is more than the Closing Contribution Cash Consideration,
Newco shall pay to GP no later than three business days after the Final Adjustment Report Date, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to (A) the excess of the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration over the Closing Contribution Cash
Consideration, each as specified in the Final Adjustment Report (such excess, the Contribution Cash Consideration Surplus Amount) plus (B) interest computed at the Prime Rate plus 100 basis points for the period from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment on the Contribution Cash Consideration Surplus Amount less the amount of such Contribution Cash Consideration Surplus Amount attributable to the CapEx Difference and Adjusted Indebtedness, plus (C) interest computed
at the borrowing costs of the Company under the Senior Credit Facility for the period from the Closing Date to the date of such payment on such portion of the Contribution Cash Consideration Surplus Amount attributable to the CapEx Difference and
Adjusted Indebtedness.  
15 


 (c) The term
Working Capital Amount shall mean Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. The terms Current Assets and Current Liabilities shall mean the consolidated current assets and the consolidated
current liabilities, respectively, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, calculated in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and as set forth on Schedule 2.3(c). The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm is limited to
whether or not the calculation of the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration was done in a consistent manner with the provisions of this Agreement (taking into account the facts and circumstances known through the period of review of the
Preliminary Adjustment Report), and whether or not there were errors of fact or mathematical errors in the Final Adjustment Report, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The parties acknowledge and agree to the Working
Capital Target and acknowledge and agree that such Working Capital Target will not be subject to dispute or adjustment. The resolution of the disputes submitted to the Accounting Firm shall be reflected in the Final Adjustment Report for purposes of
calculating the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration.  ARTICLE III  THE CLOSING

purpose, including for purposes of determining any liability or obligation under this Agreement. If Newco wishes to destroy such Records after that time, it shall give ninety days prior written notice to GP and GP shall have the  
37 


 right, at its option and
expense, upon written notice given to Newco within that ninety-day period, to take possession of the Records within 120 days after the date of GPs notice to Newco. GP shall preserve and keep the Records of Newco and the Company retained by GP

Newcos notice to the GP.  (e) If for any
reason whatsoever the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the Buyer shall, upon written notice to do so from GP, promptly return to GP all Records furnished by GP, Newco, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
respective agents, employees or representatives (including all copies, if any, thereof) and shall not use or disclose the information contained in such Records for any purpose or make such information available to any other entity or Person to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter dated December 19, 2001, between GP and Bain Capital NY, LLC. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, GP shall not use or disclose any information

Companys and its Subsidiaries properties and assets, including any facility signs, equipment, vehicles, Internet sites, business cards, schedules, stationery, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms and other materials, if such

invoices, stationery and business cards containing GP Trademarks no later than 270 days after the Closing Date and (ii) nothing herein contained shall require or be construed to require Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary to cause customers of
Newco, the Company and the Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to property of Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary in the possession of any such customers. Newco shall not, and shall cause the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates not to, make any direct or indirect use of GP Trademarks from and after the expiration of 270 days after the Closing Date. Newco shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates not to, after the

equals or exceeds the aggregate appraised value of the removed properties.  (b) Each of GP and the Company agrees to use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to consummate a sale-leaseback transaction between GP and a third-party purchaser, pertaining to the
Sale-Leaseback Property, it being understood that unless the parties otherwise mutually agree, the Buyer will in consultation with GP manage the process of negotiating with such third party purchaser. In connection with such sale-leaseback
transaction, GP will enter into sublease agreements with the Company or its Subsidiaries providing for the occupation of the Sale-Leaseback Property, by the Company or its Subsidiaries at a market rent not to collectively exceed $15,000,000 per

pursuant to lease agreements  
39 


 between GP and the Company at
a market rent not to collectively exceed $15,000,000 per year, with an initial term of twenty years with market extensions, and on terms and in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties, including market escalators, and conveying to the Buyer no
fewer rights with respect to such properties than GP has under such lease. GP shall pay any and all costs, fees, expenses (including advisory (other than Bain), broker and attorneys fees) and Taxes (including transfer taxes) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Section 7.8 (collectively, the Lease Transaction Costs). (Each of the transactions described in this paragraph (b) is a Lease Transaction.)  SECTION 7.9. Company Obligations. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or the Reorganization, each of GP and Newco agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts (not including the modification of any terms of any agreement to which Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary may be bound)
prior to the Closing Date, and on or after the Closing Date, Newco shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause GP and, to the extent applicable, each Affiliate of GP (other than Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary) to be absolutely and
unconditionally relieved on or prior to the Closing Date of any liability or obligation, direct or indirect, primary or secondary, for the payment of money or otherwise, including purchase or indemnification obligations, guarantees or performance
bonds in respect of any outstanding indebtedness, but only if set forth on Schedule 7.9, (collectively, the GP Guarantees). Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary, shall indemnify GP and such Affiliates of GP against any
loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any kind whatsoever with respect to the GP Guarantees. Newco agrees to continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date to relieve GP
or any such Affiliate of any of the GP Guarantees.  SECTION 7.10. No Shop. Other than with respect to the Sale-Leaseback Property, until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date upon which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article X hereof, GP shall not, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate or enter into discussions or transactions with, or encourage, or provide any information to: (i) any
corporation, partnership or other person, entity or group (other than the Buyer) concerning any sale of stock by the stockholders of, or any merger, recapitalization, spin-off (other than as part of the Separation) or sale of securities or
substantial assets of, or any similar transaction or alternative to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any financing by, or encumbrance of any substantial assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  SECTION 7.11. Tax Matters. (a) GP shall indemnify the
Company, each Subsidiary, Newco, and Buyer and hold them harmless from and against, without duplication, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of Newco, the Company and each
Subsidiary for all Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (Pre-Closing Tax Period), (ii)
all Taxes of any member of any Affiliated Group of which the Company or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any
analogous or similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and  
40 


 its Subsidiaries) imposed on
the Company or any of Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing; provided, however, that in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, GP shall be liable only to the extent that the total of such Taxes are in excess of the total amount reserved for such Taxes (including accrued Taxes and any Tax contingency reserve) on the Closing Balance Sheet
and taken into account in computing the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration. GP shall reimburse the Company for any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary which are the responsibility of GP pursuant to this Section 7.11(a) within five business
days before payment of such Taxes by the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, so long as GP has received notice of such payment at least twenty business days prior to such payment. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Newco, and any amounts credited or offset against Taxes of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Newco which are actually realized by such parties, that in each case relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be for the account of GP, and Newco or the Company shall pay over to GP any such refund or the amount of any such credit or offset within thirty days after receipt or actual realization thereto except to the extent accrued on the
Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in computing the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration (it being understood that tax assets shall only be included in the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent the benefit of such asset is available to
the Company and its Subsidiaries as opposed to GP). In addition, to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding results in a payment, credit or offset against Taxes by a taxing authority to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Newco of any
amount accrued as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet and taken into account in computing the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration, Newco or the Company shall pay such amount to GP within thirty days after receipt or actual realization
thereto.  (b) In the case of any Taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a Straddle Period), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company or any Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and any withholding Taxes
related to an amounts paid to any employee, independent contractor, auditor, stockholder or other third party during the Pre Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any Subsidiary holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time). The amount of other Taxes of the Company
and any Subsidiary for a Straddle Period which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.  (c) GP shall include the income of the Company and each Subsidiary which is a member of the Affiliated Group (including any deferred items
triggered into income by Reg. § 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Reg. § 1.1502-19) on GPs consolidated federal income Returns (and any combined or unitary Returns under comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign law) for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any Taxes attributable to such income. For all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, GP shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary which is a member of the
Affiliated Group at  
41 


 such time to join in GPs
consolidated federal income Return (and any combined or unitary Returns under comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law) and, in jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from GP and with respect to any other Subsidiary, to file separate
company Returns where appropriate.  (d) GP shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods; provided that any positions taken on such Returns and any elections made on such Returns do not
have an adverse impact in any material respect on the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or Newco for any Taxable period ending after the Closing Date. The Company and each Subsidiary shall furnish information to GP as reasonably requested by GP to
allow GP to satisfy its obligations under this section.  (e) Newco shall cause the Company to, and GP shall, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Returns pursuant to this Section 7.12 and any audit, appeal,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, appeal, litigation
or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Newco shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to, and GP shall, agree (i) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and any Subsidiary relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by
Newco or GP, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Newco or GP, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records.  (f) Buyer and GP further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).  (g) GP shall have the right to control, contest and represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any audit, appeal, litigation or other proceeding relating to Taxes for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. GP shall not
settle any audit in a manner which would have an adverse impact in any material respect on the Company or any Subsidiary for any Taxable period ending after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld. GP shall notify Newco and the Company upon the commencement of, prior to the settlement of, and upon any material event (as determined by GP in good faith) with respect to, any such audit, appeal, litigation, or other
pleading.  (h) GP shall not elect to retain any
net operating loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers of the Company or any Subsidiary.  
42 


 (i) Newco
shall not make any election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any of the Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of GP, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  (j) GP shall deliver to the Buyer at the Closing a certificate complying with the Code and Treasury
Regulations, in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.  (k) GP shall cause the provisions of any Tax sharing agreement
between GP or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary on the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such
tax sharing agreement.  (l) Newco agrees that it
shall not, and shall not cause or permit Newco, the Company or any Subsidiary to carry back to any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss, loss from operations or other Tax attribute, and further agrees that GP
has no obligation under this Agreement to return or remit any Refund or other Tax benefit attributable to a breach by the Buyer of the foregoing undertaking.  SECTION 7.12. Transfer Taxes. Except as specifically contemplated in Section 7.8 hereof, all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein shall be paid equally by GP and Newco, and GP and Newco shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax laws.  SECTION 7.13. Reorganization. Each of GP, Newco and the
Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization on or prior to the Closing Date.  SECTION 7.14. Secured Liquidity Facility. On the Closing Date, each of GP and the Company shall execute the Secured Liquidity

Date, GP will grant to Newco and the Company a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, worldwide license (the GP License) to use, modify and create derivative works from all GP-owned software set forth on Schedule 7.17(a),
to the extent such software is used in the conduct of the Companys and its Subsidiaries businesses on the Closing Date, excluding any improvements, modifications or acquisitions thereafter (the GP Software).
 (b) The License shall permit use of the GP
Software by each of Newco and the Company and its Subsidiaries. The GP Software may not be disclosed, distributed, sold, licensed, leased, sublicensed, traded, encumbered, or otherwise provided to or accessed by any other Person, or used for the
benefit, either direct or indirect, of any other Person.  (b) Newco acknowledges and agrees, and on behalf of the Company following the Closing acknowledges and agrees, that all GP Software is a trade secret, and shall be protected by each of Newco and the Company as such.  (d) NEWCO, THE COMPANY AND THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT THE GP SOFTWARE AND THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE ARE LICENSED OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY AS IS AND WHERE IS WITH NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OWNERSHIP, PERFORMANCE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  (e) Newco agrees, and agrees to cause the Company, to comply with any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning the import
or export of technology and software (including encryption) as they apply to the GP Software.  (f) Newco and the Company shall indemnify, defend at their expense and hold harmless GP and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents against any and all claims,
actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, awards, judgments, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs of suit) relating to  
46 


 the breach of any provisions
of the GP License by any of Newco, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  (g) With respect to the Third Party Software set forth on Schedule 7.17(g)(i) (the Critical Software), GP agrees to use its com0pmercially reasonable efforts to obtain on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries at GPs expense (up to a maximum amount of $8,500,000, including the cost of up to an eighteen-month extension of GPs SAP software license) the right to use such Critical Software (by license
assignment, modification or otherwise, at GPs sole discretion), so as to allow the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue using such Critical Software as it is used in the conduct their respective businesses as of the Closing Date. The
Company acknowledges and agrees (A) that it will be solely responsible for any cost associated with or obtaining the right to use the Critical Software in excess of $8,500,000 and (B) that GP will not be liable for the cost of any software or
hardware maintenance agreement entered into by the Company or by another party on its behalf in connection with the Critical Software. With respect to the Third Party Software set forth on Schedule 7.17(g)(ii) (the Optional
Software), each of GP and Newco agrees that if either of them determines that it would be in its respective best interest for the Company to obtain the right to use any of the Optional Software (by license assignment, modification or
otherwise, at GPs sole discretion), so as to allow the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue using any such Optional Software in the conduct of its business as of the Closing Date, GP agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain on behalf of the Company such Optional Software. Any costs associated with obtaining the Optional Software (up to a maximum amount of $2,000,000) as set forth in the preceding sentence shall be paid equally by GP and the Company. GP
understands and agrees that it will be solely responsible for any costs of obtaining the right to use the Optional Software in excess of $2,000,000; provided, that the parties agree that GP shall not be liable for the cost of any software
maintenance agreement entered into by the Company or by another party on the Companys behalf in connection with the Optional Software. The acquisition by any of GP, Newco or the Company of such Third Party Software for the benefit of the
Company in accordance with this Section 7.17(g) is, collectively, the Software Separation.  (h) Newco and the Buyer acknowledge that GPs efforts to effect the Software Separation (collectively, the
Negotiations) will take significant time and effort, depend on a number of factors outside of the control of GP, and will not be completed prior to or immediately after the Closing. GP agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to begin the Negotiations at or immediately after the Closing, and to perform them in a diligent manner consistent with the way GP would conduct such Negotiations for itself; provided that (i) GP is not obligated to, but may, hire
additional personnel to assist with the Negotiations and (ii) Newco, the Company and the Buyer shall provide reasonable and timely cooperation to GP (e.g., by purchasing new or extended maintenance agreements, which would be at Newcos expense,
to reduce software license fees). Newco and the Buyer shall provide all reasonable information to GP to assist GP in the Negotiations. Newco and the Buyer may at their discretion participate solely in an advisory capacity in the Negotiations (each
at its own expense).  (i) GP agrees that, with
respect to any breach of a Third Party Software agreement relating to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, by the violation of one or more consent, assignment and/or change of control
provisions) that results in any additional costs or expenses to the Company or any  
47 


 Subsidiary (a Default
Cost), such Default Cost will be allocated among GP, Newco and the Company in accordance with the allocation provisions set forth in Section 7.17(g) above if such default is remedied in connection with obtaining the consents for the
Critical Software or the Optional Software. If such default is not cured in such manner, then such Default Cost shall be paid to GP.  (j) In connection with the Software Separation, Newco will cause the Company to enter into new agreements or consent to license
assignments or modifications to existing Third Party Software agreements (New Software Arrangements) to the extent that such New Software Arrangements contain terms and provisions substantially identical to the existing Third
Party Software agreements. Any New Software Arrangements that do not contain terms and provisions that are substantially identical to existing Third Party Software agreements will be required to be in a form reasonably acceptable to Newco.
 SECTION 7.18. Management Agreement. Not
less than five days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to provide to GP a copy of the management agreement entered into between the Buyer and the Company. The Buyer further agrees to provide any amendments, waivers or modifications to such
agreement to GP within three days of the effectiveness of any such amendments, waivers or modifications.  SECTION 7.19. Restated Newco Charter. On or prior to the Closing Date, GP shall cause Newco to adopt the Restated Charter.
 SECTION 7.20. Mutual Release. Except as
set forth in Article IX hereof, effective upon the Closing Date, each of GP, Newco, the Company and the Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges forever each other party from any and all
liabilities and obligations to, and agreements with, any other party (or any of their respective affiliates) of any kind or nature whatsoever (excluding obligations arising under any of the Transaction Agreements and any instrument, certificate or
agreement executed pursuant thereto), including, without limitation, in respect of rights of contribution or indemnification, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated and whether arising hereunder or under any other
agreement or understanding or otherwise at law or equity, and each party hereby covenants and agrees that it will not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from any other party.  SECTION 7.21. Lemelson IP Rights. GP and Newco agree to
enter into a sublicense or similar agreement with respect to Lemelson intellectual property rights to the extent permitted under that certain intellectual property rights agreement by and between GP and the Lemelson Medical, Education Research
Foundation LLP.  ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS TO CLOSING  SECTION 8.1. Conditions to Obligation of the Buyer. The

any breach (or third party allegation that, if true, would constitute a breach) on the part of GP of any representation or warranty made by it contained in Articles IV or V of this Agreement (determined for purposes of this Article IX without
reference to any qualification in such representation or warranty of Knowledge, materiality, Material Adverse Effect or dollar threshold except with respect to Section 4.13(b) (Intellectual Property) and Section 4.17(b) (Absence of Material Adverse

following the Closing, GP shall indemnify Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and representatives against, and shall hold them harmless from, any loss, liability, third-party claim, damage or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses but excluding punitive damages (other than punitive damages payable to a third party attributable to the pre-Closing conduct of the Company), for or on account of or arising from or in connection with or otherwise
with respect to any claim by a third party (including any Governmental Entity) to the extent made against the Buyer that would be a claim for which GP would be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a) hereof if such claim had

51 


 respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives against, and shall hold them harmless from, any loss, liability, third-party claim, cost, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses but excluding punitive damages (other than

hereunder shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section 9.3. In the event that any written claim or demand for which the party from whom indemnification is sought (an Indemnifying Party) would be liable to any
Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than fifteen days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of
such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the
Claim Notice); provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty days from the personal delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the Notice Period) to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim or demand.  (b) All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by, the Indemnifying Party. Except as hereinafter provided, in the event that the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any losses relating thereto (without deduction, offset or
limitation by operation of any provision hereof, other than as provided in Section 9.4 hereof), (ii) the claim or demand does not seek to impose any liability on the Indemnified Party other than for money damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Indemnified Party, its financial ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations.  (c) If any Indemnified Party desires to participate in any such defense it may do so at its sole cost and expense; provided, that,
the cost and expense of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party if (i) the Indemnifying Party has so agreed, (ii) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified party or (iii) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a  
52 


 claim or demand for which it
seeks or may seek to be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless such settlement (i) is only for a claim of monetary damages and (ii) includes a general and unconditional release of each
Indemnifying Party from any liabilities arising out of such claim or demand. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle a claim or demand for which it may be required to provide indemnification to the Indemnified Party without the written consent of
the Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (i) is only for a claim of monetary damages and (ii) includes a general and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from any liabilities arising out of such claim or demand. If the Indemnifying
Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim or demand whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand (so long as it is a claim or demand
in respect of which indemnification is available hereunder) or, if the same be contested by the Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which such defense is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such defense)
shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder. To the extent the Indemnifying Party shall direct, control or participate in the defense or settlement of any third-party claim or demand or participate in the defense or settlement of any
third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party and its counsel reasonable and non-disruptive access to, during normal business hours, the relevant business records and other documents, and shall permit them to
consult with the employees and counsel of the Indemnified Party.  SECTION 9.4. Limitations Upon Indemnification; Survival of Representations. (a) The parties agree that the remedies provided in this Article IX are the exclusive remedies for any breach of representation, warranty or covenant
under this Agreement other than for actual fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary:  (i) GP shall not be obligated to provide any indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (to the extent
related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)) for any breach of Section 4.18 to the extent that a liability or loss arising from such breach is reflected in the Final Adjustment Report and specifically included in the
calculation of the Adjusted Contribution Cash Consideration;  (ii) GP shall not be obligated to provide any indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (to the extent related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)) (other
than with respect to the Excluded Representations) unless and until the aggregate amount for which it is obligated to provide such indemnification exceeds the sum of $8,000,000, (the Threshold Amount), after which, subject to the
other provisions of this Article IX, GP shall be obligated to pay the entire amount of any such excess above the Threshold Amount which is payable by it pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1;  (iii) in calculating the Threshold Amount, any
individual loss, liability, third-party claim, damage or expense for which GP shall be obligated to provide indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (to the extent related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section
9.1(a)(i)), or series of related losses, liabilities, third-party claims, damages or expenses for which GP  
53 


 shall be
obligated to provide indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (other than with respect to the Excluded Representations), totaling less than $75,000 (De Minimis Losses) shall be excluded in its or their entirety
from the Threshold Amount and in any event GP shall have no liability hereunder for any such De Minimis Losses;  (iv) losses, liabilities, third-party claims, damages or expenses for which GP shall be obligated to provide
indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (to the extent related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)) shall not include punitive damages (other than punitive damages payable to a third party);  (v) in order to prevent duplication of
recovery, no claim for indemnification shall be made by either Newco or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) of this Agreement with respect to any loss to the extent that GP is obligated to indemnify the Buyer for the same loss pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) (to the extent related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)) of this Agreement;  (vi) in no event shall the aggregate liability of GP under Section 9.1(a)(i) and Section 9.1(b) (other than with respect
to the Excluded Representations) exceed the sum of $150,000,000; and  (vii) GP shall not be obligated to provide any indemnification under section 9.1(a)(i) or Section 9.1(b) (to the extent related to a matter subject to indemnification under Section 9.1(a)(i)) for any
losses arising out of any breach of a representation or warranty of GP to the extent that the Buyer or Newco has been fully compensated for such loss due to such loss causing a reduction in the Closing Contribution Cash Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.3 of this Agreement.  (b) The
representations and warranties in this Agreement (other than the Excluded Representations which shall survive the Closing indefinitely, the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.15 (Taxes) and 4.24 (Employee Benefits) which shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation and the representations and warranties in Section 4.14 (Environmental), which shall survive the Closing for a period of five years) and the indemnification provisions
in this Agreement in respect thereof shall survive the Closing until thirty months after the Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate; provided, however, that such termination shall not affect any claim for breaches of
representations or warranties if written notice thereof, in reasonable detail, is given to the breaching party or parties prior to such termination date.  (c) THE BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT GP MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, EXCEPT THOSE EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES SHALL BE ACQUIRED AT THE CLOSING AS IS, WHERE IS ON THE CLOSING DATE.  
54 


 SECTION 9.5.
Computation of Indemnifiable Losses. Any amount payable pursuant to this Article IX shall be (i) reduced by the amount of any reduction in cash Taxes and increased by the amount of any increase in cash Taxes, in each case payable by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such losses and (ii) reduced by any amounts when, as and if actually received by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies, less any retro-premium obligations and the present value of any reasonably anticipated
increase in insurance premiums on account of such losses. If a reduction in cash liability for Taxes of the Indemnified Party (less any increases in cash Taxes) occurs in a taxable period following the period in which the indemnification payment is
made, the Indemnified Party shall promptly repay the Indemnifying Party the amount of such reduction when actually realized.  SECTION 9.6. Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the
event any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise is breached, so that a party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled, at law or in equity. In particular, the parties acknowledge that the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is unique and
recognize and affirm that in the event that GP breaches this Agreement, money damages would be inadequate and Buyer would have no adequate remedy at law, so that Buyer shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in
its favor, to enforce its rights and the other parties obligations hereunder not only by action for damages but also by action for specific performance, injunctive, and/or other equitable relief.  SECTION 9.7. Setoff. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party does not pay any amount determined by the final and non-appealable judgment or settlement of a court of competent jurisdiction to be due to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to set-off any such finally determined
amounts against any amounts that the Indemnified Party may owe to the Indemnifying Party. In those instances where GP is the Indemnifying Party, Newco shall have the right to set-off any amounts owed to it as the Indemnified Party by cancelling a
portion of the PIK Notes or the Newco Shares held by GP equal to the amounts finally determined to be owed to Newco as the Indemnified Party. The amount of PIK Notes and Newco Shares to be cancelled by Newco shall be determined with reference to the
fair market value of such PIK Notes or Newco Shares (as determined by an independent third party) at the time of such cancellation. In order to secure all of GPs obligations under this paragraph, Newco will receive a first priority security
interest and lien on the PIK Notes and Newco Shares.  ARTICLE X  TERMINATION,
AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  SECTION 10.1.
Termination. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing (i) by mutual written consent of the parties
hereto, (ii) by GP or the Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or prior to December 31, 2002; provided, however, that if the parties have been unable to close the transaction by such date despite their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, then such termination date shall be extended until  
55 


 January 30, 2003;
provided, further, that the party seeking termination pursuant to this clause (ii) is not in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) by GP if, as a result of action
or inaction by the Buyer, the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the date that is ten business days after the most recently completed fiscal month-end of the Company following the date on which all of the conditions to Closing set forth

the event of termination by any party hereto pursuant to this Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without further action by any
party. If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein, the Buyer shall promptly return to GP, Newco, the Company and the Subsidiaries all documents and other material received from such Persons relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof.  (c) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this Section 10.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and
effect, except for the provisions of (i) this Section 10.1, (ii) Section 11.7 relating to publicity and (iii) Section 7.5 regarding certain expenses. Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any
willful breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.  SECTION 10.2. Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any of the parties hereto may, by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party, waive compliance by any other party with any term or provision of this Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to comply with or perform.  ARTICLE XI  MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION 11.1. Notices. All notices, requests and other
