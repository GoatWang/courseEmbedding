AV-101
Potential Breakthrough in Depression Treatment
Potential for Ketamine-like Antidepressant Effects without Ketamine's CNS Side-Effects
AV-101 (L-4-chlorokyurenine or 4-CI-KYN) is an orally available new generation prodrug candidate, in Phase 2 development, initially for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressants.
VistaGen believes it has the potential to expand AV-101 into multiple additional CNS indications beyond adjunctive treatment of MDD, including neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and bipolar depression), neurological disorders (chronic neuropathic pain and epilepsy) and neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease), each representing potential blockbuster opportunities.

New generation oral antidepressant prodrug candidate, rapidly absorbed through the gut, actively transported into the brain, converted into its active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA, and binds to NMDAR GlyB site
Similar to ketamine: acts in the brain through the same glutamatergic AMPA-dependent pathway, rapidly inducing antidepressant effects
Safer than ketamine: blocks the NMDAR through GlyB site binding; ketamine blocks the ion channel of NMDARs, causing its negative side effects
Safe and well-tolerated in two NIH-funded Phase 1 safety studies; no ketamine-like side effects
Drug-drug interaction and "Black Box" metabolic effects related to standard antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics not anticipated




In peer-reviewed and published preclinical studies, AV-101 demonstrated the robust antidepressant-like activity of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine HCl, an FDA-approved anesthetic, including low dose ketamine's rapid onset and long duration of antidepressant effects, without any of ketamine's CNS side effects. In two NIH-funded randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 safety studies, AV-101 was safe, well-tolerated and not associated with any severe adverse events. There were no signs of sedation, hallucinations or schizophrenia-like side effects often associated with ketamine and other NMDA receptor ion channel blockers.
AV-101's Mechanism is Fundamentally Differentiated from All FDA-Approved Standard Antidepressants and Atypical Antipsychotics

Committed to Advancing a New Generation of Oral Antidepressants
AV-101, an NMDA receptor glycine-binding (GlyB) site antagonist, is a new generation oral antidepressant drug candidate in Phase 2 development, initially for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with an inadequate response to standard FDA-approved antidepressant therapies, which consist primarily of commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as atypical antipsychotics (such as aripiprazole) often administered with them, adjunctively. Orally-available AV-101 is a new generation drug candidate for MDD with a mechanism of action that is similar to that of ketamine, and fundamentally differentiated from all FDA-approved antidepressant therapies.

Major Depressive Disorder
Depression is a Global Public Health Concern

Depression is a serious medical illness and a global public health concern that can occur at any time over a person's life. While most people will experience depressed mood at some point during their lifetime, major depressive disorder (MDD) is different. MDD is the chronic, pervasive feeling of utter unhappiness and suffering, which impairs daily functioning. Symptoms of MDD include diminished pleasure in activities, changes in appetite that result in weight changes, insomnia or oversleeping, psychomotor agitation, loss of energy or increased fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions, and thoughts of death or suicide and attempts at suicide. Suicide is estimated to be the cause of death in up to 15% individuals with severe MDD or bipolar disorder. For many people, depression cannot be controlled for any length of time without treatment. Standard medications available in the multi-billion-dollar global antidepressant market include commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole.
The Issues with Standard Antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs)

About two out of every three drug-treated patients suffering from depression do not receive adequate therapeutic benefit from their initial treatment with a standard, FDA-approved antidepressant, and the likelihood of achieving remission declines with each successive treatment attempt.
We are developing AV-101, a new generation, oral CNS prodrug candidate in Phase 2 clinical development, initially as adjunctive treatment, replacing the widespread use of atypical antipsychotics such as aripiprazole, for tens of millions of MDD patients worldwide suffering from an inadequate response to standard antidepressants. Paradigm-shifting clinical studies performed by Dr. Carlos Zarate and others at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Yale University and several other academic research centers have demonstrated that, when given intravenously, a single low dose of ketamine can produce robust and rapid antidepressant effects in MDD patients. AV-101 is functionally similar to ketamine in that both are NMDA receptor antagonists. However, AV-101 modulates NMDA receptor channel activity and ketamine blocks it. We believe that this difference in receptor activity can potentially bypass the adverse side effects that occur with ketamine.
Where AV-101 Might Fit as an Adjunctive Therapy in the Depression Treatment Algorithm

About
VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: VTGN), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new generation medicines for depression and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Our lead CNS product candidate, AV-101, is a new generation oral antidepressant drug candidate in Phase 2 development. AV-101's mechanism of action is fundamentally differentiated from all FDA-approved antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics used adjunctively to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), with potential to drive a paradigm shift towards a new generation of safer and faster-acting antidepressants.
AV-101 is currently being evaluated by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in a Phase 2 monotherapy study in MDD being fully funded by the NIMH and conducted by Dr. Carlos Zarate Jr., Chief, Section on the Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood Disorders and Chief of Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch at the NIMH, and one of the world's foremost experts on the use of low dose IV ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonists to treat MDD. VistaGen is also preparing to launch a 180-patient Phase 2 study of AV-101 as an adjunctive treatment for MDD patients with inadequate response to standard, FDA-approved antidepressant therapies. Dr. Maurizio Fava of Harvard University will be the Principal Investigator of the Phase 2 adjunctive treatment study.
AV-101 may also have the potential to treat multiple CNS disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in addition to MDD, including chronic neuropathic pain, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, where modulation of the NMDAR, AMPA pathway and/or key active metabolites of AV-101 may achieve therapeutic benefit.
In addition to our AV-101 programs, VistaStem, VistaGen’s wholly owned subsidiary, is applying our human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology platform and CardioSafe 3D™, our customized in-vitro human cardiac cell bioassay system, to predict potential heart toxicity of new chemical entities (NCEs) long before they are tested in preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies. Having successfully assessed AV-101 and numerous other drug candidates to establish the clinically predictive capabilities of CardioSafe 3D, we are now using CardioSafe 3D™ to expand our pipeline through cardiac liability-focused small molecule drug rescue, and to participate, together with a select group of companies, in the FDA's Comprehensive in-vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA) initiative designed to change the landscape of preclinical drug development by providing a more complete and accurate assessment of potential drug effects on cardiac risk. We are also focused on collaborating with others to advance development and commercialization of medicine and cell therapy applications of our stem cell technology across a range of cell types, including blood, bone, cartilage, heart and liver cells. In December 2016, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement with BlueRock Therapeutics L.P, a next generation regenerative medicine company established by Bayer AG and Versant Ventures, for our rights to proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease.

Company Overview


VistaGen Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VTGN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing new generation therapies for depression and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. VistaGen’s lead CNS product candidate, AV-101, is an orally available prodrug in Phase 2 development, initially for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with inadequate response to standard FDA-approved antidepressants. AV-101 has the potential to be faster-acting and safer than standard FDA-approved antidepressants, as well as atypical antipsychotics commonly used adjunctively to augment them. AV-101 is a NMDA receptor glycine-binding (Glyв) site antagonist and has been shown in published preclinical studies to provide fast-acting, ketamine-like, antidepressant effects without serious CNS side effects typically associated with ketamine and FDA-approved drug therapies for depression.
AV-101 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 monotherapy study in MDD, a study being conducted at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and being funded by the NIMH, and expected to conclude by the end of 2017. VistaGen is also preparing to launch a Phase 2 study of AV-101 in the first half of 2017 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD.

AV-101 has the potential to be faster-acting and safer than standard FDA-approved antidepressants, as well as atypical antipsychotics commonly used adjunctively to augment them. AV-101 is a NMDA receptor glycine-binding (Glyв) site antagonist and has been shown in published preclinical studies to provide fast-acting, ketamine-like, antidepressant effects without serious CNS side effects typically associated with ketamine and FDA-approved drug therapies for depression.
AV-101 is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 monotherapy study in MDD, a study being conducted at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and being funded by the NIMH, and expected to conclude by the end of 2017. VistaGen is also preparing to launch a Phase 2 study of AV-101 in the first half of 2017 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD.
