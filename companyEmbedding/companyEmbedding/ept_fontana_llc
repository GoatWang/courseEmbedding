investment trust (the “ Issuer ”), the other

“ Trustee ”).

W I T N E S S E T
H

WHEREAS, the Issuer has heretofore
executed and delivered to the Trustee an indenture, dated as of
June 30, 2010, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture
dated as of October 13, 2011 (as so supplemented, the “
Indenture ”), providing for the issuance of 7.750%
Senior Notes due 2020 (the “ Notes
”);

WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that
under certain circumstances the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries shall
unconditionally guarantee all of the Issuer’s Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture) under the Notes and the Indenture on the
terms and conditions set forth herein (the “ Notes
Guarantee ”); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to
Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to
execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Guaranteeing
Subsidiaries and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the
equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as
follows:

1. Capitalized Terms .
Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

2. Agreement to Guarantee .
The Guaranteeing Subsidiaries hereby agree as follows:

(a) Subject to Article 10 of the
Indenture, the Guaranteeing Subsidiaries hereby, jointly and
severally with all other Guarantors, unconditionally guarantee to
each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of
the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the
obligations of the Issuer hereunder or thereunder, that:

(i) the principal of, and premium,
if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full
when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or
otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on
the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the
Issuer to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will
be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof; and



(ii) in case of any extension of
time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other
obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or
performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal,
whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise.

Failing payment when due of any
amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever
reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to
pay the same immediately.

(b) The obligations hereunder shall
be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of
the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the
recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to enforce
the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute
a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor, other
than payment in full of all Obligations under the Notes.

(c) The following is hereby waived:
diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a
court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any
right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest,
notice and all demands whatsoever.

(d) This Notes Guarantee shall not
be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations
contained in the Notes and the Indenture, and each Guaranteeing
Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a Guarantor under the
Indenture.

(e) If any Holder or the Trustee is
required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the
Guarantors, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar
official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the Guarantors,
any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Notes
Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be
reinstated in full force and effect.

(f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiaries
shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to
the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until
payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.

(g) As between the Guarantors, on
the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand,
(x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be
accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the
purposes of this Notes Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in
respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the
event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as
provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether
or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by
the Guarantors for the purpose of this Notes Guarantee.

(h) The Guarantors shall have the
right to seek contribution from any nonpaying Guarantor so long as
the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the
Holders under this Notes Guarantee.

(i) In accordance with
Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to any
maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities that
are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy Law or fraudulent
conveyance law, and after giving effect to any collections from,
rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on
behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such
other Guarantor under Article 10 of the Indenture, this Notes
Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such
that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Notes Guarantee
will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

(a) No Guaranteeing Subsidiary may
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets
to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such

(i) immediately after giving effect
to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;
and

(ii) subject to Section 10.05
of the Indenture, the Person acquiring the property in any such
sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger assumes all of the obligations of such
Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Indenture and this Notes
Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee.

consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption

punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the
Indenture to be performed by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, such
successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the
Guaranteeing Subsidiary with the same effect as if it had been
named herein as a Guaranteeing Subsidiary. Such successor Person
thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Notes Guarantees
to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable under the Indenture
which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuer and
delivered to the Trustee. All the Notes Guarantees so issued shall
in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the
Indenture as the Notes Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such
Notes Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution
hereof.

(c) Except as set forth in Articles
4 and 5 and Section 10.04 of the Indenture, and
notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing
contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any
consolidation or merger of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary with or into
the Issuer or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or
conveyance of the property of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuer or another
Guarantor.

4. Releases .

Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall be released, and any Person acquiring
assets (including by way of merger or consolidation) or Capital
Stock of a Guaranteeing Subsidiary under those circumstances
specified in Section 10.05 of the Indenture shall not be
required to assume the obligations of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary.
Upon delivery by the Issuer to the Trustee of an Officers’
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the provisions
of Section 10.05 of the Indenture have been complied with, the
Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to
evidence the release of such Guaranteeing Subsidiary from its
obligations under this Notes Guarantee.

(b) Any Guarantor not released from
its obligations under its Notes Guarantee shall remain liable for
the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for
the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as
provided in Article 10 of the Indenture.

Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The CAP Technologies EPT process can be used for cleaning and coating metals of any shape and size. The EPT process can clean steel to 100% with no material loss. Coatings deposited using the CAP Technologies EPT process do not form any intermetallic layers. The absence of these intermetallic layers, which are common with hot dip galvanizing, allow the rod to be drawn or formed with no flaking or dust formation. In addition, products with coating deposited using EPT:

Provide 2-3 times better corrosion protection than products that have been hot dip galvanized


Can be drawn to 97% reduction with no loss of coating




The CAP Technologies EPT process can deposit zinc and zinc nickel at rates up to 2m/second. Coating thickness in the EPT process is controlled by adjusting the speed of processing. Our coatings are uniform and accurate because we do not depend on wipes to remove excess coating. CAP coatings are ductile and can be drawn directly up to 97% reduction in area with no intermediate step, such as patenting, without any delamination or loss of coating.
CAP Technologies can zinc and zinc nickel coat wire from 0.032” to 0.300” as well as high and low carbon rod 1006C-1092C





Nickel coatings are widely used in various applications demanding high corrosion and wear resistance. The main advantage of using EPT for Ni coatings are high rates of  deposition and excellent ductility at subsequent cold metal forming steps such as wire drawing, rolling and flat wire forming. CAP Technologies can nickel coat wire from 0.008” to 0.137” as well as high and low carbon rod. CAP Technologies can also:

Ni on Al- 100% pure Ni can be deposited on Al with excellent ductility and uniform coverage
Ni on SS – 100% pure Ni with excellent ductility and uniformity for lubrication during spring manufacturing.

 



Silver is a widely used metal in the jewelry, electronics, and medical industries. It is the best metal for thermal and electrical conductivity, as well as being antimicrobial. Scientists have demonstrated that silver ions can latch on to sulfur-containing thiol groups in bacterial biomolecules disrupting their activity and thereby killing the microbes.
• 100% pure Silver coating can be deposited. 100% effective against E.coli.
You can find more technical information on our silver coatings [HERE].
