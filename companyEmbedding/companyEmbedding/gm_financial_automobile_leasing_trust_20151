      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to GM 
      Financial Automobile Leasing Trust 2015-1:
    

      --$129,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$329,360,000 class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$369,360,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,930,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42,240,000 class B asset-backed notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,940,000 class C asset-backed notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$30,170,000 class D asset-backed notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: 2015-1 has a weighted average (WA) non-zero 
      obligor FICO score of 736, a relatively diverse mix of vehicles, and 
      undiscounted base residuals of 66.22% as a percentage of securitization 
      value (SV).
    

      New Leasing Platform: GMF began originating auto leases in December 
      2010; therefore, empirical data are limited. Fitch supplemented the GMF 
      data with proxy data from comparable origination platforms to derive a 
      credit loss expectation. While residual value (RV) performance data for 
      GM vehicles were utilized, an additional residual loss haircut was 
      employed to account for potential volatility in auction proceeds owing 
      to the servicer.
    

      Concentrated Lease Maturities: Lease maturities are more concentrated in 
      2015-1, with the highest single-month maturity totaling 12.7% of the 
      base RV and peak six-month residual maturities totaling 56% of the pool, 
      both higher than 2014-2.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial hard CE totals 
      18.40%, 14.55%, 11.00% and 8.25% for class A, B, C and D notes, 
      respectively. Based on a 1.50% credit loss expectation stressed for each 
      rating category and stressed RV loss expectations ranging from 
      33.7%-19.3% for 'AAAsf' to 'BBBsf', available CE is sufficient to 
      support each expected rating.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following very strong performance in recent years. Fitch 
      expects that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from 
      rising production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations 
      during the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GMF 'BB+'/Positive Outlook. Fitch 
      believes GMF to be a capable originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GMF would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GM Financial Automobile 
      Leasing Trust 2015-1 to increased credit and residual losses over the 
      life of the transaction.
    

      Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays relatively little 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, showing downgrades 
      between one and less than one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5x base case loss). The transaction shows more sensitivity to 
      residual loss volatility; though even under Fitch's severe scenario the 
      class A and B notes would be expected to retain an investment grade 
      rating.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further detailed in 
      Fitch's presale report, published today and available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in GM Financial Automobile Leasing Trust 
      2014-2- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's October 2014 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
