 HistoryArel Capital was founded in early 2013 by Richard Leibovitch and Gabriel Bousbib. Following successful nearly three decade careers in capital markets, asset management and hedge funds, Richard and Gabriel formed Arel Capital to manage their personal capital and the capital of a few former hedge fund partners. They decided to focus on US real-estate, with a particular emphasis on multi-family rental properties.  Parallel to his finance career, Richard had been successfully investing his personal capital in this type of properties.  In addition, Richard and Gabriel felt that due to the secular decline in interest rates, the urbanization of large metropolitan areas, and the growing demand by millennials for rental product, this asset class was likely to outperform, both on a relative and absolute basis.
Having known each other for nearly 20 years, and worked together for more than 10 years, Richard and Gabriel form a very strong team, with a very clear allocation of responsibilities.  Richard had overall responsibility for Arel Capital’s investment decisions, whilst Gabriel focuses on the firm’s operations and infrastructure.
During 2013 and 2014, a number of key individuals joined Arel Capital, further expanding the firm’s real-estate and finance expertise.  The firm counts today 15 full time staff and is headquartered in New York City.
The firm’s first transaction was the purchase of a 70 townhouse complex in Houston for $8.8 million in March of 2013.  Since then, Arel Capital has closed 28 transactions, representing about $1.5 billion worth of real-estate in five cities (New York, Houston, Denver, Austin and Charlotte).  More than 150 limited partners, including high net worth individuals, family offices and institutional investors, have invested in Arel Capital transactions.

Charlotte Gainsbourg ‎– IRM (LP)                        Skip to navigation Skip to content  Search for:      €0.00 0 items      Charlotte Gainsbourg ‎– IRM (LP)€99.99A lot happened to Charlotte Gainsbourg between the release of 5:55 and IRM. Along with appearing in I’m Not There as one of Bob Dylan’s wives, a 2007 water skiing accident pushed her brain to the side and filled her skull with blood, a condition that should have killed or paralyzed her. After emergency surgery, Gainsbourg was fine physically, but still convinced she could die at any moment, undergoing several MRI scans to prove she was all right. She also took one of her most daring roles as an actress, appearing in Lars Von Trier’s uncompromising film Antichrist as a violently deranged, grieving mother who disfigures herself and her husband. This mix of fragility and boldness is also the heart of IRM, Gainsbourg’s collaboration with Beck. As with 5:55, which featured Nigel Godrich, Jarvis Cocker, and Air, her choice of collaborators is perfect, but the results couldn’t be more different. Where her previous album was ethereal and ephemeral, IRM is exciting and eclectic. Beck and Gainsbourg bring out the best in each other: His songwriting and production are so sympathetic and wide-ranging that he’s like a director guiding Gainsbourg to inspired performances. Meanwhile, she brings an emotionality and presence to Beck’s flights of fancy that make them more grounded than they would have been as his own songs. IRM still offers plenty of beautiful French atmosphere, but it’s more mussed than on 5:55: The way the strings turn from romantic to a little sinister on the slinky “Le Chat Du Café Des Artistes” is decidedly jolie laide, while “La Collectioneuse” is as eerie as it is lovely. However, the album delivers much more than looser versions of where Gainsbourg has been before. IRM’s title track is a hallucinatory meditation on Gainsbourg’s post-surgery experiences that incorporates the sound of MRI scans (IRM is the French abbreviation of MRI) with a tribal, distorted beat and detached vocals that are closer to Broadcast than any of her previous music. Elsewhere, she dives into deceptively simple folky pop with “Me and Jane Doe” while “Trick Pony”’s breathy sexuality and strutting beats feel like Beck repaying the favor of sampling Serge Gainsbourg’s “Melody Nelson” on Sea Change’s “Paper Tiger.” The pair gets more daring as IRM unfolds, with Beck casting Gainsbourg as a world-weary siren on “Dandelion”’s bluesy shuffle, and a sneering rebel on the brittle “Greenwich Mean Time,” which makes more noise than all of the songs on 5:55 put together. Gainsbourg’s mental and physical healing process unites the album’s experiments, making them personal. “Heaven Can Wait”’s joyful stomp is self-explanatory, but when she sings “you could learn to crawl where you used to walk” on “Vanities,” or “It doesn’t take a miracle to raise a heart from the dead” on “Time of the Assassins,” it adds even more depth. Playful, heartfelt, and unexpected, IRM gives Gainsbourg’s music a new lease on life.In stock  Add to cart  SKU: CGIL Categories: Female Vocals, Jazz, New Sealed Records, Rare & Collectable Tags: Beck Hansen, Bob LudwigShare this:Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)MoreClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Share on Skype (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Description Additional informationDescriptionBecause Music ‎– BEC5772607 2 × Vinyl, LP, France 2009Side 1.1.
