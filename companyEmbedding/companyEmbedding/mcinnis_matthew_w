Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                  Matt is an INCREDIBLE professor! I failed math twice in high school, so you could see why I would be terrified of college mathematics. But, to my surprise, Matt made me LOVE math. Now if that doesn't tell you something I don't know what will. If you are lucky enough to have him as an option for MATH119, jump at the opportunity! You won't regret it.

SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.


                  This guy made me like math again. Made it really simple to understand topics. Did lots of examples on the board as a class and he did a lot of in class activities relevant to the topics we were learning. Best math teacher ever from grade school to college !

                  Took this class once with another prof, failed it. Took it with Matthew and it seemed so much easier. That says a lot. It was clear and thorough. I definately recommend this guy. Lots of positive energy.
