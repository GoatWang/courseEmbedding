Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS'  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In some cases, forward-looking statements are identified by terms such as "may", "will", "should", "could", "would", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "projects", "predicts", "potential", and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements.

We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.  Overview  We import glass containers from Asia and distribute to the North American market including Canada. This was a result of International Packaging and Logistic Group, Inc. ("IPL Group Inc.") acquiring H&H Glass in July of 2007. IPLGroup, Inc. closed its pharmacy business in February 2007.  H&H Glass is a glass importer that supplies custom products such as perfume bottles and food condiment bottles, plus provides complementary services such as product design and the making of product molds. H&H Glass acquires its products from 3 to 5 suppliers in China and Taiwan and sells its products through several distributors in the United States and Canada who service small- to medium-sized customers.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


September 30, 2010

 

 

 

1.           
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Organization
and Basis of Presentation

 

These
interim condensed consolidated financial statements represent the
financial activity of International Packaging and Logistics Group,
Inc., (“IPL Group” or “the Company”) a
publicly traded company listed and traded on the NASDAQ Over the
Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”).  The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.  The interim condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries.  All intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.  The Company’s
fiscal year end is on December 31.

 

The
foregoing unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information and with
the instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X as promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include all of the disclosures required by generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America for complete
financial statements.  These unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto included on Form 10-K for the period ended
December 31, 2009.  In the opinion of management, the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
furnished herein include all adjustments, all of which are of a
normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the
results for the interim period presented.

 

The
preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known
to exist as of the date the condensed consolidated financial
statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Uncertainties with
respect to such estimates and assumption are inherent in the
preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial
statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results
could differ from these estimates and assumptions that could have a
material effect on the reported amounts of the Company’s
financial position and results of operations.

 

Operating
results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2010, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2010.

 

Nature of
Operations

 

On July 2,
2007, International Packaging and Logistics Group, Inc., through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, YesRx.com (“YesRx”)
acquired all the outstanding shares of H&H Glass, Inc.
(“H&H Glass” or “H&H”), in exchange
for 3,915,000 shares of its common stock in a reverse triangular
merger (the “Merger”).  H&H Glass is a
glass importer that supplies custom products such as perfume
bottles and food condiment bottles, plus provides complementary
services such as container design and mold
making.  H&H Glass imports glass containers from Asia
and distributes to North America.  H&H Glass acquires
its products mainly from one supplier in China and Taiwan and sells
its products through several distributors in the United States and
Canada who service small to medium sized
customers.  H&H imports in excess of 1,000 shipping
containers of glass a year.  Depending on the size of the
product, a container can contain anywhere from 3,000 to 300,000
pieces.

Packaging and Logistics Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was
originally incorporated as Interactive Medical Technologies, Ltd.,
on June 2, 1986, in the state of Delaware.  On April 17,
2008, IPL Group converted from a Delaware corporation to a Nevada
Corporation.

 

EZ Link
Holdings Ltd .

 

EZ Link
Holdings Ltd. was incorporated in 2009, under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands. The Company has no substantive operations
of its own.

 

EZ Link
Corp., a Taiwan company established in July 2003 with initial
registered capital of NTD 13,500,000, is a freight forwarder with
current networks of locations in China, Hong Kong, South East Asia,
North East Asia, North America, Latin America and Europe, and holds
the licenses and approvals necessary to operate its business in
China.

 

Taiwan law
currently has limits on foreign ownership of companies. To comply
with these foreign ownership restrictions, on December 31,
2009, EZ Link Holdings entered into following exclusive agreements
with EZ Link Corp. and its owners (collectively the
“Contractual Arrangements”):

 

 (1)
Consulting Services Agreement , through which EZ Link
Holdings has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate EZ
Link Corp. and collect and own all of its net profits;

 

 (2)
Operating Agreement , through which EZ Link Holdings has the
right to recommend director candidates and appoint the senior
executives of EZ Link Corp, approve any transactions that may
materially affect the assets, liabilities, rights or operations of
EZ Link Corp, and guarantee the contractual performance by EZ Link
Corp. of any agreements with third parties, in exchange for a
pledge by EZ Link Corp. of its accounts receivable and
assets.

 

In
consideration of services provided by the consultant, EZ Link Corp
will pay a consulting fee equal to all of its net income on a
quarterly basis.

 

The terms
of these Consulting Agreements begin as of the date of the
Agreements, and shall continue in perpetuity, unless terminated in
accordance with relevant provisions in the agreements  or
by any other agreement reached by all parties.

Consolidation
of variable interest entities

 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 810, “Consolidations,”
variable interest entities (VIEs) are generally entities that lack
sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional
financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack
adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the Company
is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary
of the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is
required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting
purposes.

 

The
Company has concluded that EZ Link Corp is a VIE and that the
Company’s 51% owned subsidiary, EZ Link Holdings, absorbs a
majority of the risk of loss from the activities of EZ Link
Corp.  and enables the Company to receive a majority of
its expected residual returns. Accordingly, the Company accounts
for EZ Link Corp. as a VIE as of September 30, 2010.

 

Because
the Company and EZ Link Holdings are under common control, the
initial measurement of the assets and liabilities of EZ Link Corp.
for the purpose of consolidation by the Company is at book value.
EZ Link Holdings, Ltd. has had no other business activities except
for the entering into of the exclusive agreements with EZ Link
Corp. and its shareholders.

 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements for the Company, its subsidiaries and the variable
interest entity, EZ Link Corp. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances between the Company, its subsidiaries and
the variable interest entity are eliminated upon
consolidation.

 

Country
risk

 

As the
principal operations of EZ Link Holding, Ltd. are conducted in
Taiwan, it is subject to special considerations and significant
risks not typically associated with companies in the US. These
risks include, among others, risks associated with the political,
economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange
limitations encountered in Taiwan. The EZ Link Holdings results of
operations may be adversely affected by changes in the political
and social conditions in Taiwan, and by changes in governmental
policies with respect to laws and regulations, among other
things.

 

In
addition, most of the transactions undertaken in Taiwan are
denominated in New Taiwan Dollars (NTD), which must be converted
into other currencies before remittance out of Taiwan may be
considered. Both the conversion of NTD into foreign currencies and
the remittance of foreign currencies abroad require the approval of
the Taiwan government.

 

Principles
of Consolidation

 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America.  EZ Link
Corp’s functional currency is the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD),
however, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been re-measured and presented in United States
Dollars ($).

1.           
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)

 

The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of IPL Group and its subsidiaries (collectively the
“Company”).  The Company’s subsidiaries
include H&H Glass, Effective Health, Inc. and 51% of EZ Link
Holdings, Ltd.

 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at
September 30, 2010, include EZ Link Holdings, Ltd., from the
January 1, 2010 date of acquisition.  Intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon
consolidation.

 

Estimates

 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
condensed consolidated financial statements.  Significant
estimates include an allowance for doubtful accounts and
depreciation of property, plant and equipment.

 

Acquisition
Accounting

 

Per
Accounting Standard Codification topic 805, Business Combinations,
the assets and liabilities acquired were allocated at fair value of
the shares issued. This statement requires the Company to recognize
Contact in place

as of the
acquisition date, measured as a residual, the excess of the
consideration transferred plus the fair value of the
non-controlling interest at the acquisition date, over the fair
values of the net assets acquired.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.  Cash equivalents include amounts invested
in a money market account with a financial
institution.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which
approximates fair value.

 

Contact in
place

 

Contact in
place is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance
with the authoritative guidance for Contact in place. Additionally,
Contact in place is tested in the interim if events and
circumstances indicate that Contact in place may be impaired. The
events and circumstances that are considered include business
climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators and
competition. Impairment of Contact in place is evaluated using a
two-step process. The first step involves a comparison of the fair
value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the
second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value
and the carrying amount of the Contact in place of that reporting
unit. If the carrying amount of the Contact in place of a reporting
unit exceeds the fair value of that Contact in place, an impairment
loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of
carrying value over fair value. If an event occurs that would cause
a revision to the estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the
value of the Contact in place, the revision could result in a
non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on the
financial results. As of September 30, 2010, the Company recorded
no impairment of Contact in place.

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company recognizes product revenue provided that (1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery to the customer has
occurred, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and (4)
collection is reasonably assured.  Delivery is considered to
have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the
customer.  The price is considered fixed or determinable
when it is not subject to refund or
adjustments.  Outbound shipping and handling charges are
included in net sales.

 

Foreign
Currency Translation

 

All assets
and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date, stockholder's equity are translated at the historical
rates and statement of operations items are translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year. The resulting
translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive
income gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are reflected in the income statement.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risk

 

The
Company, at times, maintains cash balances in excess of the
federally insured limit of $250,000 per institution.   In
December 2008, the Company’s bank entered into the FDIC
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which eliminated the ceiling
on federally insured deposits.  During the nine months
ended September 30, 2009, the Company’s bank ceased
participating in the program, which returned the limit to $250,000
per institution.  The Company had uninsured balances of
$103,685 and $0 as of September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009,
respectively.

 

The
Company maintains balances in a Money Market Fund that is not
federally insured.  Balances in this fund were $890,259
and $71,863 at September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009,
respectively.

 

The
Company had an unsecured available-for-sale investment with a fair
value of $230,013 at December 31, 2009.  During the three
months ended September 30, 2010, the Company sold the investment
and realized a gain on its investment of $93,038.

 

Accounts
receivable are typically unsecured.  The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition.  It generally requires no collateral and
maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer
accounts, when necessary.  As of September 30, 2010,
78.4% of H&H Glass’s Accounts Receivable were
attributable to three customers.  As of December 31,
2009, 77.0% of H&H Glass’s Accounts Receivable were
attributable to three customers.  At September 30, 2010
and December 31, 2009 H&H Glass had a reserve for doubtful
accounts of $0 and $0 respectively.

 

At
September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, EZ Link Holdings, Ltd had
a reserve for doubtful accounts of $5,247 and $0,
respectively.

 

In general
the Company will reserve a receivable amount based one of the
following reasons;

 

1) If the
receivable is over 90 days old the company will reserve 50% and if
over 12 months old the Company will reserve 100% of the amount;
and

 

2) If the
customer rejects the product and the reject is due to a Company
error, a reserve will be established.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)

 

H&H
Glass purchased 100% of its glass from one vendor in the three- and
nine- month period ending September 30, 2010 and 2009.  During
the three-month period ending September 30, 2010 and 2009, H&H
Glass purchased $5,966,082 and $3,972,239 of products from this
vendor, respectively.  During the nine-month period
ending September 30, 2010 and 2009, H&H Glass purchased
$15,046,126 and $9,239,337 of products from this vendor,
respectively. This concentration is due to the relatively
small size of H&H Glass’s orders.  H&H
Glass’s specialized short-run custom orders generally are not
attractive to larger glass manufacturers.  As customer orders
have been growing in size, H&H Glass has begun to seek and use
additional suppliers.

 

Non
controlling Interest

 

The
Company’s accounts for its non controlling interest of 49% in
EZ Link Holdings, Ltd. in the condensed consolidated financial
statements classified as a separate component of equity. In
addition, net earnings, and components of other comprehensive
income are attributed to both the Company and non-controlling
interest.

 

Net
Earnings/(Loss) per Share

 

Earnings/(loss)
per common share is computed on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year.  Basic
earnings per share is computed as net loss applicable to
common

stockholders’
divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
through convertible preferred shares, stock options, warrants and
other convertible securities when the effect would be
dilutive.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

The
Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  ASC Topic
820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,”
requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial
instruments.  For certain of the Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short
maturities.

 

ASC 820
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value and expands the related disclosure
requirements.  The statement indicates, among other
things, that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction
to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal
market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal
market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability
based upon an exit price model.

 

ASC 820
prescribes a fair value hierarchy in order to increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related
disclosures.  The hierarchy is broken down into three
levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:

 




 



•



Level 1—Valuations
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets.  Since valuations are based on quoted prices that
are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation
of these products does not entail a significant degree of
judgment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)

 




•  



Level 2—Valuations
based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which
all significant inputs are observable, directly or
indirectly.  Quoted prices for similar instruments in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments
in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable
or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially
the full term of the assets or liabilities.





•  



Level 3—Valuations
based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the
overall fair value measurement.




 

The
Company designates cash equivalents (consisting of money market
funds) and investments in securities of publicly traded companies
as Level 1.

 

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

 

The
Company reports and displays comprehensive income and its
components in a full set of general-purpose condensed consolidated
financial statements. The Company’s unrealized loss of $7,786
and $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009,
respectively and a gain of $12,255 and $0 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relate to the
translation of financial statements from New Taiwan Dollar to US
Dollars. The Company also recorded an unrealized gain of $17,627
for the three months ended September 30, 2009, and a gain of
$33,369 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, on
investments available for sale.   During the three
months ended September 30, 2010, the Company sold its investment
and realized a gain of $93,038.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In January
2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06 to improve disclosures about fair
value measurements. ASU 2010-6 clarifies certain existing
disclosures and requires new disclosure regarding significant
transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 of fair value
measurements and the reasons for the transfer. The amendments in
ASU 2010-06 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal
periods.

 

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), and the SEC
did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact
on the Company's present condensed consolidated financial
statements.

 

2.           
Preferred Stock Transactions

 

As of
January 1, 2010 pursuant to the purchase agreement for 51%
ownership in EZ Link Holdings Ltd., approximately one half of the
purchase price amount $400,000 was paid in Series B convertible
preferred shares of IPL Group, Inc. at a per share value of $1.00,
or 400,000 shares.

 

Description
of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

 

The
Preferred shares are convertible into common shares on a 1:1 ratio
at a fixed rate of $1 per share.  Preferred shares have
no voting rights, have no redemption rights and earn no
dividends.

Preferred Stock Transactions (continued)

 

The
Preferred Shares shall be convertible into common shares in two
equal traunches, the first being upon completion and receipt of the
year ending December 31, 2010, financials if all of the following
performance targets are met by EZ Link:

 

(a)
Maintain revenues and before tax earnings same as the prior 12
month period; and

(b)
Maintained a positive cash flow from operations over the prior 12
month period.

 

The
second traunch of the Preferred Shares shall be convertible after
the second 12 month period, i.e. the year ending December 31, 2011,
if all of the following performance targets are met by EZ
Link:

 

(a) 5%
increase in revenues and 1% before tax earnings over the prior 12
month period; and

(b)
Maintained a positive cash flow from operations over the prior 12
month period.

 

 

ASC Topic
480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,”
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity.

 

A
mandatorily redeemable financial instrument shall be classified as
a liability unless the redemption is required to occur only upon
the liquidation or termination of the reporting
entity.  A financial instrument issued in the form of
shares is mandatorily redeemable if it embodies an unconditional
obligation requiring the issuer to redeem the instrument by
transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date (or
dates) or upon an event certain to occur.  A financial
instrument that embodies a conditional obligation to redeem the
instrument by transferring assets upon an event not certain to
occur becomes mandatorily redeemable—and, therefore, becomes
a liability—if that event occurs, the condition is resolved,
or the event becomes certain to occur.

 

The
Company determined that the preferred shares are not mandatorily
redeemable and are properly classified as permanent equity in the
accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements.

 

 

3.
