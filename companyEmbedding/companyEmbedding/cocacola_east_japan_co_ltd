Questions Regarding Quality of Our Products

QuestionWhat should I do with a product that is different from other ordinal products (e.g. a loose cap, foreign matter contamination, and unusual taste)?

AnswerIf you happen to pick up an unusual and suspicious-looking product, please never drink it. Keep the product and contact us with "Inquiry". We appreciate your time and consideration.



QuestionIs not there any problem if I see sediment in Ayataka?

AnswerAyataka is the product using green tea’s original cloudiness and the sediment is matcha, a source of cloudiness, so there is no problem in the quality.  Please shake it well before drinking.



QuestionI have at hand a product after the best-before date.  Can I drink it?

AnswerThe “best-before date” shows the period that you can enjoy a tasty drink as long as you have not open the package and have stored the product in accordance with the storing method.  It does not mean that you cannot drink a product as soon as it expires, but please drink it before the best-before date as it may gradually deteriorate in flavor.



QuestionI want to stockpile Mori no Mizudayori for emergency.  How long is the best-before period?

AnswerThe best-before period is two years.  Each best-before date is stated on all containers.  Please drink as soon as possible after opening a cap or lid and make sure to put unfinished drink in a fridge.



QuestionHow long should I finish after opening the package.

AnswerAs for products which you often drink directly from a container such as 280ml or 500ml Small PET bottles and canned products, you are requested to drink it as soon as you open the package.
									As for 1L, 1.5L or 2L Large PET bottles, please keep them refrigerated and drink it as soon as possible.   Generally, we recommend you to finish the refrigerated drink within two or three days after opening the package.  If you put your mouth on a Large PET bottle, you are recommended to finish it as soon as possible on the same day.  
								




Questions Regarding Labeling

QuestionWhere can I find the best-before date?

Answer[Can] A six-digit number is stated at the bottom of a can.
									[PET bottle] A six-digit number is stated around a cap.
									For products with a black cap, it is stated at the below a cap (the upper part of a bottle or label),
									For Glaceau, it is stated at the below a cap and the upper part of a bottle.
									[Bottle Can] A six-digit number is stated at the upper part of a bottle can.
									[Bottle (labeled glass bottles)] Normally, a six-digit number is stated on the lateral or upper side of a cap.
								



QuestionWhere is the calorie stated?

AnswerPlease find the section of the nutritional composition labeling on a label.  In case of Coca-Cola products, you can see the calorie mentioned in “Energy.”



QuestionWhat is the difference between juice and extract?

Answer“Juice” is extracted from fruits while “extract” is obtained by extracting specific components from plants, etc. by use of water or alcohol.



QuestionWhat is FOSHU, food for specified health use (tokuho)?

AnswerFOSHU refers to foods claiming a scientific basis such as effectiveness and safeness and screened and approved by the government.  FOSHU contains health-promoting components that affect physiological functions, etc. of the human body and intends to help maintaining normal blood pressure or blood cholesterol.



QuestionPlease elaborate on the differences in description among “non-sugar”, “less sweetened” and “moderated sugar.”

AnswerUnder the nutrition label standards, products may be labeled as “non-sugar” in case of less than 0.5g of sugar and “low-sugar” or “less sweetened” in case of 2.5g or less of sugar per 100ml of liquid form food for drinking consumption.  When labeling with emphasis on less sugar, they may be labeled so as long as they meet the nutrition label standards.
									There is no numerical criterion for “moderated sugar” and it is stated in products which sugar is used more moderately than common products.
								




Questions Regarding Ingredients

QuestionI am diabetic and concerned about my blood sugar level. Will I be fine if I drink Coca-Cola Zero?

AnswerSweetener used for Coca-Cola Zero does not contain ingredients to increase blood sugar level.



QuestionHow much caffeine does KARADA SUKOYAKA Cha W contain?

Answer47mg of caffeine is contained in one bottle (350ml PET).



QuestionWater used for Coca-Cola products is safe?

AnswerWe measure radioactive material in water for our products, properly store products, water and raw materials and strictly conduct a safety test by a Japanese or overseas inspection agency under the government criteria or the Coca-Cola System’s internal safety standards, whichever is stricter. We acknowledge that there is no problem as there has been no value measured exceeding the threshold so far.  We will flexibly respond to any changes in standard-setting by public agencies and business environment.



QuestionDo you offer any tea products that do not contain caffeine (Zero caffeine or non-caffeine)?

AnswerSokenbicha [Sukkiri (refreshing) Blend) contains no caffeine.



QuestionWhat is Coca-Cola made from?

AnswerCoca-Cola is made from sugar (high fructose corn syrup, sugar), caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural flavors and caffeine.  Caramel is made by adding water to sugar and heating it and is used for cakes and puddings.




Questions Regarding Specific Products

QuestionWhy do you state in Georgia canned products to shake the can lightly and waited for a while before opening?

AnswerMilk or cream components may become solid and white lees and float on liquid level or settle in the liquid. The containers have higher pressure than the air and the content become foamy more easily than the ones in steel canned products.  If you give it a strong shake, the content may squirt out of a can, so we ask you to shake it lightly.  After shaking it softly, please wait for a while before opening to settle the foaming.



QuestionWhy do you state in some Georgia aluminum canned products not to shake the can?

AnswerThe containers have higher pressure than the air and the content become foamy more easily than steel canned products.  If you give it a strong shake and the content becomes foamy, it may squirt out of a can, so we state not to shake it.



QuestionCoca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero are black color.  What is the color made from?

AnswerThe unique color of Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero is caramel color.  Caramel is made by adding water to sugar and heating it and is widely used for puddings, sources, cookies, soft drink, alcohol and milk beverages, etc.



QuestionI heard that Coca-Cola was named after cocaine. Is it true?

AnswerNo.  The name of Coca-Cola is not related with cocaine at all.  “Coca-Cola” was named due to its present sound.




Questions Regarding Container

QuestionIs it safe to freeze PET bottled beverages in a freezer?

AnswerPlease do not as it is dangerous.  If you freeze a drink in a PET bottle, the content swells and the container may be deformed or broken, resulting in sealing performance decline.  For the same reason, please avoid freezing soft drink in a can or bottle.  Also, the flavor may change.  Please do not freeze them for you to enjoy the drink.



QuestionCan I heat up a beverage in a container?

AnswerPlease do not as it is very dangerous.  Please make sure that you drink it after putting the content in other container and heating it up.  If you put the container on an open fire such as a range or a stove or put it in a pod over a fire, the temperature becomes too high and the container may be deformed or exploded.




Other Questions

QuestionThe product that I want is not available in my neighborhood. What should I do?

AnswerWe will look up our product offering situation in your desired area and please contact us with "Inquiry". (We appreciate your understanding that we may not be able to offer you the desired product depending on the area and product.)

(“CCBJI”).Under the deal, Coca-Cola West will acquire Coca-Cola East Japan and the latter’s common shareholders will receive 0.75 Coca-Cola West common shares. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola West shareholders will own 53.3% of CCBJI while Coca-Cola East Japan shareholders will hold 46.7%. However, the proposed integration is yet to receive approval by the shareholders of both companies.COCA COLA CO Price COCA COLA CO Price | COCA COLA CO QuoteBackground & Financial SynergiesIn Apr 2016, the companies had agreed to integrate their businesses to form a bottler that would account for about 86% of Coca-Cola products sold in Japan. As per a report by researcher Inryosoken, the Coca-Cola brand controlled about 27% of the country’s soft-drinks market last year.CCBJI, which is expected to be established on Apr 1, 2017, is expected to boost Coca-Cola’s competitive position in the Japanese beverage market by responding more quickly to the ever changing consumer preferences in the market.Coca-Cola West has a market cap of about 313 billion yen (as of Sep 30) and currently serves 22 prefectures across the regions of Kinki, Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu, which jointly have a population of approximately 45 million. Coca-Cola West’s sales volumes represent approximately 35% of the total Coca-Cola branded products sold in Japan.On the other hand, Coca-Cola East Japan has a market cap of 279 billion yen, as of Sep 30, 2016, and represents 51% of total Coca-Cola branded products sold in Japan. It caters to the South Tohoku, Kanto and Tokai regions, including Tokyo and 15 prefectures. This equals to a population of approximately 66 million.Hence, with this integration, CCBJI will likely have greater synergies by leveraging the strength of the two entities’ commercial operations and will experience higher cost competitiveness in supply chain.These synergies are expected to result in annual run-rate pre-tax savings of approximately 20 billion yen within three years of closing.Coca-Cola has been divesting and merging several bottling operations across many international markets since 2014 to revamp its bottling system and thus, improve margins and drive growth.Three of its European bottlers — Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetränke AG (German bottler) — merged to form a new Western European bottler named Coca-Cola European Partners, Inc. CCE this May.The company can successfully work through the comprehensive refranchising and near-term macro challenges, courtesy of its growth strategies.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Coca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked beverage stocks include Primo Water Corporation PRMW and Pepsico, Inc. PEP.Primo Water is expected to witness a 140% rise in 2016 earnings.
