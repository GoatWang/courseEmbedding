 Educational Background



 


Texas A&M University

                  Texas A&M University (A&M or TAMU) is a coeducational public research university located in College Station, Texas, United States. It is the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System, the fourth-largest university in the United States and the largest university in Texas.Texas A&M's designation as a land, sea, and space grant institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. The school ranks in the top 20 American research institutes in terms of funding and has made notable contributions to such fields as animal cloning and petroleum engineering.                




 


Southern Methodist University - Dedman School of Law

                  We are a global law school community of distinguished alumni residing throughout the United States and in more than 75 countries.

Our faculty is well-recognized for its outstanding teaching and scholarly leadership in such areas as dispute resolution (including litigation), international and comparative law, intellectual property, corporate, commercial and tax law. We offer a rich curriculum of over 165 upper class courses in subjects such as oil and gas, health and environmental law. Over one-half of our upper class courses have fewer than 25 students; three-fourths have fewer than 50 students. The first year class is divided into three sections (two full-time and one part-time evening) of approximately 90 students each, with small legal writing sections of approximately 25 students each. We emphasize the vital skill of legal writing through our six-hour legal research, writing and advocacy course and an elective three-hour edited writing seminar.

The law quadrangle provides an idyllic setting for learning. The Underwood Law Library houses the largest private law collection in the Southwest. The Godwin Gruber Lawyers Inn offers students an elegant backdrop for study breaks and meals. A secure wireless network is available in all law school buildings. Most importantly, our small size fosters a scholarly community that features interaction with faculty, attention to your personal needs, and lifelong friendships. We have an active student government, five respected law journals, six specialized legal clinics and two related projects, numerous moot court and mock trial competitions, and one of the finest Career Services Offices in the country.

In addition, students participate in the thriving intellectual life of the school. We have been chosen as the national headquarters for the Appellate Judges Educational Institute. In 2006 the Institute brought over 225 appellate judges and attorneys from across the country to SMU, including Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Chief Justices of Texas and Indiana, and the Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit. Recently, the 35 students in our SMU Oxford program assisted with our Supreme Court Summit in which Justices O’Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer participated, as did Justices from Europe's highest court, the European Court of Justice. In spring 2007, we were honored to host a group of distinguished Justices from the ECJ on campus.

A thriving community of scholars call Dedman Law home. Our distinguished faculty, coupled with our intelligent and inquisitive student body personify Robert Dedman's words, "Leadership starts with learning."                





 Career History



Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer & Secretary

                                    2010 - Current                


RealPage, Inc.


                  RealPage, Inc. is a leading provider of on demand (also referred to as "Software-as-a-Service" or "SaaS") products and services for the rental housing industry. Our broad range of property management solutions enable property owners and managers to increase revenues and reduce operating costs through higher occupancy, improved pricing methodologies, new sources of revenue from ancillary services, improved collections and more integrated and centralized processes.

Based in Carrollton, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, RealPage was formed in 1998 to acquire Rent Roll, Inc., which marketed and sold industry-leading on premise property management systems for the conventional and affordable multifamily rental housing markets. In June 2001, we released OneSite, our first on demand property management system. Since 2002, we have expanded our on demand software solutions to include a number of software-enabled value-added services that provide complementary sales and marketing, asset optimization, risk mitigation, billing and utility management and spend management capabilities. In addition, our growth has been supported by the acquisition of complementary technologies to supplement our internal product development and sales and marketing efforts; expand the scope of our solutions; and the types of rental housing properties served by our solutions and our customer base.

We provide our SaaS products and services to more than 8,000 customers to help manage the operations of approximately 7.8 million rental housing units.
