NEW YORK, May 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- 








First Quarter 2016 Highlights

Cash available for distribution ("CAD") of $0.31 per share 
First quarter 2016 cash dividend of $0.10 per common share 
In January 2016, acquired an approximately 84% interest in The Townsend Group ("Townsend") for $383 million, a leading global provider of investment management and advisory services focused on real assets 
Raised $177 million of capital in retail business year-to-date 2016 
Total assets of managed companies as of March 31, 2016 of approximately $35.5 billion, including investments under contract, acquired or sold by our managed companies subsequent to the first quarter 2016 and including Townsend
NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE:    NSAM) today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
First Quarter 2016 Results
NSAM reported CAD for the first quarter 2016 of $59.7 million, or $0.31 per share. Net income to common stockholders for the first quarter 2016 was $17.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.
For more information and a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) to common stockholders, please refer to the tables on the following pages. 
David T. Hamamoto, Executive Chairman, commented, "We are pleased with NSAM's consistent operating performance and first quarter results. We look forward to enhancing our earnings power with our recent acquisition of Townsend and the sustained growth in our retail business, which continues to generate very attractive fee revenue for our company. Our retail capital raised to date in 2016 represents sales only from our $1.65 billion NorthStar Income II product which, with the introduction of a new trailing commission structure, continues to pick up strong sales momentum as we look to close out this offering later this year.  With the addition of our recently effective and soon to be effective retail companies targeting $9 billion of capital in market friendly structures and the recent issuance of a more flexible than anticipated Department of Labor rule, we expect significant additional momentum in our retail business as we move through 2016."
Al Tylis, Chief Executive Officer, added, "NSAM continues to deliver strong results, including improved operating margins during the first quarter.  Since commencing the strategic alternatives process in January, Management and the Board, including the special committee and its advisors, have focused on evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value. To that end, and as announced last Friday, we are currently in exclusive negotiations on a three-way business combination with Colony Capital and NRF."

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Included in this press release is Cash Available for Distribution, or CAD, a certain "non-GAAP financial measure", which measures NSAM's historical or future financial performance that is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, within the meaning of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules.  NSAM believes this metric can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined below.
Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) 
We believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Management also uses CAD, among other measures, to evaluate profitability. In addition, the incentive fees to which we are entitled pursuant to our management agreements with each of our NorthStar Listed Companies are determined using such NorthStar Listed Company's CAD as a performance metric. We believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts net income (loss) for a variety of non-cash, one time and certain non-recurring items.
We calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests attributable to the Operating Partnership and the following items: equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization related items, amortization of deferred financing costs, foreign currency gains (losses), impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets, straight-line rent, adjustments for joint ventures and investment funds, deferred tax (benefit) expense related to timing differences that are not expected to reverse in the current year, unrealized (gain) loss from fair value adjustments, realized gain (loss) on investments and other, timing differences associated with receiving incentive fees and the related compensation expense and transaction and other costs. In future periods, such adjustments may include other one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items.  These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures. Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders.
CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion, and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.
The following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

Related: Northstar Nutritionals - Complete "SNAKE OIL" Worthless
It did nothing for me I was kinda embarrass when the intimate moment came.
So I call the Customer service number and spoke to Erma very rude person. But she said i would received my refund in 5 to 7 days. I decided to call back since she was so rude and this time spoke to a lady that cared about the customer much nicer. She advised i should not see anymore charges and refund in 5 to 7days.
Sorry this product did nothing for my ED.Texas

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
