Method and system for treating ballast water



Patent number:  8968575
                                            

Abstract:  Ballast and/or cooling water biocidal treatment and disinfection systems and techniques are provided. The systems utilize oxidation reduction potential control to regulate addition, or concentration of an electrocatalytically generated biocidal agent to disinfection levels in ship buoyancy and to biofouling levels in ship cooling water systems. The disinfection and biofouling control systems provide suitable treatment while reducing the potential for corrosion of ship components and, in some cases, undesirable disinfection byproducts.

Job Details
               The Upper Dublin Public Library serves township residents of all ages (as well as residents from surrounding communities) through our mission to connect "people and ideas to educate, inspire and strengthen the Upper Dublin community. To that aim, the UDPL recognizes technological literacy as a real and necessary skill in today's world. The UDPL has long provided its patrons with basic technology, including public computers with Internet and Microsoft Office. The UDPL STEAM Lab represents a program that moves beyond those traditional technology tools to expose patrons to equipment, software and programs to which they do not have access and to open the doors of their imaginations by sharing cutting-edge technology that they may not even know exists. The UDPL STEAM Lab will offer a number of new technology based programs in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math. UDPL is dedicated to providing STEAM Lab opportunities to patrons of all ages beginning in the fall of 2015. Funding for the UDPL STEAM Lab was made possible by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services as administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Education through the Office of Commonwealth Libraries, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, Governor. Additional funding has been provided by the generous support of the Friends of UDPL.
