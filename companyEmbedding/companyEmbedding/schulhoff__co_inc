Tree Fertilizing & Soil Amendment
Before the building of the City of Denver and its surrounding towns and suburbs, the land that Denver occupies was a high plains desert with little trees. The majority of the trees seen around the city were either brought down from the mountains or imported from other parts of the country. This means that it is highly important to take care of your trees. Read more about Tree Fertilization & Soil Amendment here.

Reasons For Tree Removal

Storm damage is one common reason for tree removal. Such as simply blowing over in a strong wind, if they are covered in snow or drenched in rain. An aging or damaged tree is one of the most common reasons that homeowners call tree service companies to come to their home.
Another really common reason that people will call for tree removal is disease. There are a lot of different diseases and insects that will literally eat away at your trees. Many times, homeowners do not even notice the problem until it is too late to save the tree, in which case they call for tree removal services.
The other really common reason that people consider tree removal is because they are changing their landscape. Homeowners simply want to change the landscape outside their home or business. In many cases, tree removal does not have to mean the death of the tree; the tree can simply be transplanted to another area.

Tree Injections for Trees in Golden, CO

 
 
 
 





 


Imagine sitting beneath the tree you planted when you were a child. You lean back against the sturdy trunk that mirrored your growth throughout your childhood. But, when you look up into the branches, you notice wavering and dying limbs.
Trees are a great landscaping investment that requires regular care. This care should include proactive tree injections. In Denver, CO and the surrounding areas, no one is better qualified to protect your trees than Schulhoff Tree & Lawn Care, Inc.
Consult with Our Skilled Arborists
At Schulhoff, we employ trained and certified arborists. These experts can help you choose the right injection regimen for your trees. We offer comprehensive injections, including:

Fungicides that eliminate common harmful growths
Growth regulators that produce ideal growth levels
Insecticides, including treatments which prevent multiple insect species
Nutrients, including combinations that compensate for deficiencies caused by poor soil quality

Work with our arborists to tailor the injections to your tree. The injection frequency, location, and efficacy depend on the type of injection you decide on.

 
 
 



Benefit from Ideal Application Technique
Our arborists will either inject the chosen compounds directly into the tree or into the surrounding soil. This method provides the following advantages over other types of administration:

Comprehensive options: While a single injection cannot prevent all possible insect damage, our mixtures
allow you to protect your trees from a range of threats with a single injection.
No aerial sprays: Research links traditional aerial application to detrimental effects on human and environmental well-being. Aerial sprays are also the least effective option available. Protect your family, trees, and investment by opting for injections.
Long-term effects: Injections last longer than any other type of application.

Get these tree care benefits today. For your consultation, call our team at (303) 279-1910 to discuss your options for tree injections in Denver, CO.  Request an estimate and we will reach out to you.

We’ll Deal with Emerald Ash Borer Problems in Golden, CO

 
 
 
 




Emerald Ash Borer Beetle Confirmed Here in Colorado
The Colorado Department of Agriculture confirmed that the Emerald Ash Borer was found in Boulder County in September 2014. This destructive pest has caused billions in damaged across the Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. We have been following the migration of this insect and knew this would happen, but hoped it wouldn’t be this soon.
So What Is the Emerald Ash Borer?
The Emerald Ash Borer is a small, but very destructive beetle. An adult beetle easily fits on the size of a penny, and is metallic green, with a slender body that measures half an inch long. Native to China and eastern Asia, the beetle most likely arrived in North America hidden in wood packing materials used to ship consumer goods. They first arrived in Michigan, where it was likely present for up to 12 years before anyone detected it. The beetle is behind the death and decline of tens of millions of Ash trees. And now, much to our dismay, this pest has arrived in Colorado.

How To Identify and Monitor Ash Tree Stress Symptoms

Sparse foliage or thinning of the canopy
Presence of epicormic shoots, sprouting from the trunk and roots or suckers
Bark splitting
D-shaped emergence holes on trunk
Increased woodpecker activity
Serpentine galleries from larvae feeding under the bark


 
 


How to Identify The Emerald Ash Borer

Adults are approximately 1/2 inch long
Metallic emerald green head and back
Bark splitting
Coppery reddish-purple abdomen
Increased woodpecker activity
Larvae are cream colored and have bell shaped segments


 
 
 



Preventing Emerald Ash Borer Damage
There is hope! Ash tree treatments include two different types of systemic insecticides. The control is going to vary. Young trees will get a different treatment than larger trees. The treatment of large trees is time consumptive, and chemical cost is higher. The good news, it’s good for 2 seasons and does cross over in controlling Lilac Ash Borer. Young trees will require a yearly treatment that is not as costly, but does not control the Lilac Ash Borer. Our Arborists are ready to help you protect your Ash trees. Call 303-279-1910 or send us an online estimate request and we’ll come out and recommend a plan for the best protection of your Ash trees.
