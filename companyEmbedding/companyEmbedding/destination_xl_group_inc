Alliance with PredictSpring Brings Fast Mobile Commerce Experience to Shoppers

Canton, MA (PRWEB)
July 20, 2017
 Destination XL Group, Inc.

History[edit]







What is now Destination XL Group was founded in 1976 by Calvin Margolis and Stanley Berger as Designs, Inc., a chain of retail stores that sold Levi's Dockers.
In May 2002, Designs, Inc. bought the Casual Male Big & Tall chain of stores out of bankruptcy and elected to focus their business on those stores, selling off their other businesses and assuming the Casual Male name.[8]
In 2004, the company acquired Rochester Big & Tall Clothing, which gave the company access to a number of designer brands including Robert Graham, Tommy Bahama, Cutter & Buck, Jack Victor, and Robert Talbott. Also in 2004, Casual Male hired former champion boxer George Foreman to promote the chain and act as spokesman for new lines of clothing bearing his name.
In 2005, Casual Male changed the name of its stores from Casual Male Big & Tall to Casual Male XL.[9]
In 2010, the company opened its first DXL store in Schaumburg, Illinois. Big & Tall customers were looking for a superior shopping experience – one that provided a better blend of quality, selection, and service. This new store opening marked the starting point of the company’s transition from Casual Male XL to DXL.
In May 2013, the company launched its first television and radio advertising campaign, entitled “No Man’s Land,” which supported the DXL brand.
As of 2016, there were more than 200 DXL retail stores in operation across every major metropolitan market in the United States.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The company is headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, and its common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "DXLG." DXLG operates both retail stores and ecommerce businesses through its five trade names: DXL, Rochester Clothing, Casual Male XL, Shoes XL, and Living XL. These can all be found under the multi-channel website DestinationXL.com.
DXLG is currently in the process of transitioning its primary store footprint from Casual Male XL to DXL, its one-stop-shopping concept.

The company also offers sizes starting at XL, including tall sizes, as well as shoes in sizes 10-16, with widths up to 4E.

DXL is also the only retailer to offer sportswear in big and tall sizes from top designers such as Brooks Brothers, Lacoste, True Religion, Michael Kors, Paul & Shark, Psycho Bunny, Reebok, PX Clothing, and Joe’s Jeans.
History[edit]







What is now Destination XL Group was founded in 1976 by Calvin Margolis and Stanley Berger as Designs, Inc., a chain of retail stores that sold Levi's Dockers.
In May 2002, Designs, Inc. bought the Casual Male Big & Tall chain of stores out of bankruptcy and elected to focus their business on those stores, selling off their other businesses and assuming the Casual Male name.[8]
In 2004, the company acquired Rochester Big & Tall Clothing, which gave the company access to a number of designer brands including Robert Graham, Tommy Bahama, Cutter & Buck, Jack Victor, and Robert Talbott. Also in 2004, Casual Male hired former champion boxer George Foreman to promote the chain and act as spokesman for new lines of clothing bearing his name.
In 2005, Casual Male changed the name of its stores from Casual Male Big & Tall to Casual Male XL.[9]
In 2010, the company opened its first DXL store in Schaumburg, Illinois. Big & Tall customers were looking for a superior shopping experience – one that provided a better blend of quality, selection, and service. This new store opening marked the starting point of the company’s transition from Casual Male XL to DXL.
In May 2013, the company launched its first television and radio advertising campaign, entitled “No Man’s Land,” which supported the DXL brand.
As of 2016, there were more than 200 DXL retail stores in operation across every major metropolitan market in the United States.

The company is headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, and its common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "DXLG." DXLG operates both retail stores and ecommerce businesses through its five trade names: DXL, Rochester Clothing, Casual Male XL, Shoes XL, and Living XL. These can all be found under the multi-channel website DestinationXL.com.
DXLG is currently in the process of transitioning its primary store footprint from Casual Male XL to DXL, its one-stop-shopping concept.

The company also offers sizes starting at XL, including tall sizes, as well as shoes in sizes 10-16, with widths up to 4E.

History[edit]







What is now Destination XL Group was founded in 1976 by Calvin Margolis and Stanley Berger as Designs, Inc., a chain of retail stores that sold Levi's Dockers.
In May 2002, Designs, Inc. bought the Casual Male Big & Tall chain of stores out of bankruptcy and elected to focus their business on those stores, selling off their other businesses and assuming the Casual Male name.[8]
In 2004, the company acquired Rochester Big & Tall Clothing, which gave the company access to a number of designer brands including Robert Graham, Tommy Bahama, Cutter & Buck, Jack Victor, and Robert Talbott. Also in 2004, Casual Male hired former champion boxer George Foreman to promote the chain and act as spokesman for new lines of clothing bearing his name.
In 2005, Casual Male changed the name of its stores from Casual Male Big & Tall to Casual Male XL.[9]
In 2010, the company opened its first DXL store in Schaumburg, Illinois. Big & Tall customers were looking for a superior shopping experience – one that provided a better blend of quality, selection, and service. This new store opening marked the starting point of the company’s transition from Casual Male XL to DXL.
In May 2013, the company launched its first television and radio advertising campaign, entitled “No Man’s Land,” which supported the DXL brand.
As of 2016, there were more than 200 DXL retail stores in operation across every major metropolitan market in the United States.

Destination XL Group, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended April 29, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Year Fiscal Year 2017
May 19 17
Destination XL Group, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended April 29, 2017. For the quarter, total sales declined slightly to $107.7 million from $107.9 million in the prior year’s first quarter. The decrease of $0.2 million in total sales was due to a comparable sales decrease of $2.1 million, or 2.1% compared to a comparable sales increase of 2.0% last year. Net loss was $6.1 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of $0.2 million, or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, for the prior year’s first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, assuming a normalized tax rate of 40%, adjusted net loss was $0.07 per diluted share compared with net income of $0.00 per diluted share for the prior year’s first quarter. The decline in earnings was driven primarily by a combination of higher planned marketing costs related to television advertising campaign as well as lower gross margin dollar contribution due to occupancy de-leverage. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a non-GAAP measure, were $2.5 million, compared with $8.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Cash flow used in operations was $4.6 million, compared with $5.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures were $6.9 million and consisted of $5.8 million for new DXL stores and $1.1 million for infrastructure projects. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 of $6.1 million consisted of $4.6 million for new DXL stores and $1.5 million for infrastructure projects. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, decreased slightly to negative $11.5 million from negative $11.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating loss was $5,234,000 against operating income of $1,055,000 a year ago. Loss before provision for income taxes was $6,036,000 against income of before provision for income taxes $271,000 a year ago. 

The company provided earnings guidance for the year fiscal year 2017. For the year, the company expects net loss (GAAP basis) of $5.7 million to $11.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $32.5 million, EBITDA (non-GAAP basis) of $24.0 million to $30.0 million, net loss per diluted share of $0.11 to $0.23, adjusted net loss of $3.4 million to $7.0 million, adjusted net loss per share of $0.06 to $0.14, cash flow from operating activities of $37.0 million to $42.0 million, capital expenditures, infrastructure projects $8.3 million, free cash flow, before DXL capital expenditures (non-GAAP basis) of $28.7 million to $33.7 million, capital expenditures for DXL stores of $13.7 million and free cash flow (non-GAAP basis) of $15.0 million to $20.0 million. The company expects income tax benefit, assuming 40% rate of $2.3 million to $4.7 million and interest expense of $3.0 million.

Destination XL Group, Inc. announces launch of first mobile app with PredictSpring

21 July, 2017 at 10:00 AM
Posted by: Sheetal Kumbhar













Destination XL Group, Inc., the retailer of men’s XL apparel, announced the launch of its first mobile app, created in alliance with mobile commerce provider, PredictSpring. Designed to assist both on-the-go and in-store shoppers, the app boasts visual appeal and ease of use.
“At DXL Men’s Apparel, we are a lifestyle destination – the one-stop shop for clothing and accessories catering to the many styles and occasions of our ‘guy’,” said Sahal Laher, chief digital officer and CIO of Destination XL Group, Inc. “DXL stores have everything available under one roof to make guys look and feel great. Now, through PredictSpring’s mobile platform, we are able to deliver the products consumers want, when and where they want it, while also creating an enhanced in-store experience.”
Additional highlights and features of DXL’s new mobile app include:

DXL Men’s apparel account and loyalty program – Customers can log in to access their account and have instant access to XL Rewards certificates and point balances, for use online or in-store. This solves the frustration of customers not having their certificates with them when shopping in-store.
Instant product search – Allows app users to apply product search filters and scan item barcodes for additional product information while shopping in-store to check sizing, colours and availability.
Store locator – Through an in-app Google Maps interface, consumers can search for stores nearby and across the country.
Incentivised offers – App users will unlock 100 rewards points with their initial app download and account log in.

“DXL Men’s Apparel is uniquely positioned to offer its consumers a one-stop, modern mobile shopping experience,” said Nitin Mangtani, founder and chief executive officer of PredictSpring. “We are thrilled to team up with DXL to offer a fast and robust app that enables shoppers to browse, search and purchase clothing from anywhere.”
Destination XL Group, Inc. currently operates 218 DXL Men’s Apparel stores across the United States, as well as two locations in Ontario, Canada. The app is currently available for download in the Apple App Store and the Google Play store.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
