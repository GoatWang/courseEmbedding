Tyler Technologies is the largest software company in the nation solely focused on providing integrated software and technology services to the public sector — cities, counties, states
and school districts.
Public sector software isn’t just what we do, it's all we do.
 








 









Appraisal & Tax
“With CLT Appraisal Services and Tyler Verify’s successful implementation, Tyler helped Montgomery County follow state mandates within a newly tightened budget,  achieve a higher accuracy level than reappraisal projects in the past and increase taxpayer confidence and support.” Bill Loy, Assistant Auditor, Montgomery County, Ohio
 











Courts & Justice
“We've been using Odyssey for eight years. We’ve established a technology foundation and can advance the product with new features and functionalities that we couldn’t do in our old system.”Caren Skipworth, Chief Information Officer, Collin County, Texas
 











Software for the People Who Serve the Public
Our software products and services are designed specifically for the people who serve the public — police officers, teachers, financial directors, 911 dispatchers, clerks, administrators, trial judges, prosecutors, tax collectors, appraisers, justices of the peace,  school bus drivers, property appraisers, parks & rec staff  — all of the public sector employees that keep our cities, counties, and states moving forward.City software, county software, local government software, state software, government management software, school management software — these are the kind of solutions we provide to the public sector.
 











ERP | Financial
“Tyler Cashiering’s convenience fee processing is a quick and easy way of reducing expenditures, without reducing services and without any additional work from staff.”Desmond Chin, Finance Director, Village of Palmetto Bay, Florida
 











Planning, Permitting & Licensing
“One of the greatest benefits of EnerGov has been the elimination in keying in the GL account information as this is now handled automatically and it is completed as soon as the invoice is created.”Mark Meyers, Building Official, City of Clovis, California
 











Tyler Leads Public Sector Software Companies
At Tyler we know the public sector inside and out, we understand your business processes and the pressures you face — from the public, the media and other government organizations.

“We made the change to Versatrans because we wanted to see immediate results and cost savings to the district. A dollar saved in the transportation department is a dollar that can be spent on a child’s education.”BJ Ison, Saint Paul Public Schools, Minnesota

Appraisal & Tax
“Residential and commercial staff members especially benefit from this solution. What used to be a tedious and potentially lengthy process can now be accomplished in seconds, without having to call citizens back with answers to their value questions.”Chris Lewis, CIO, Leon County Property Appraiser's Office, Florida
 











Public Sector Software Solutions

Highlights


State and local government and primary and 
secondary education annual spending for applications and 
vertical-specific software is currently estimated at $14 billion, with a
 compound annual growth rate of approximately 5-6 percent forecast 
through 2018.
                 
                 Tyler is continuing to enhance its offerings of 
products and services to add value to local governments, adding features
 such as Web-based solutions for real-time public access to a variety of
 public information, electronic commerce solutions for traffic tickets, 
utility bills and taxes. Competition includes regional and local 
technology firms that offer limited products and services. Often, these 
small companies lack the resources for the development needed to keep 
pace with technology advancements. In contrast, Tyler has the widest 
breadth of products in the industry, providing an integrated system of 
applications for several different government offices within the same 
jurisdiction. Tyler provides customers with the latest technology 
available and has invested significantly in product development over the
 last two years.
                 
                 The company is profitable and has experienced 
above-market growth rates from its core business. Substantial growth 
opportunities from sales to new customers, additional sales to existing 
customers and new product offerings have the potential to accelerate 
growth.

Tyler Technologies is the largest software company in the nation solely focused on providing integrated software and technology services to the public sector — cities, counties, states
and school districts.
Public sector software isn’t just what we do, it's all we do.
 








 









Appraisal & Tax
“With CLT Appraisal Services and Tyler Verify’s successful implementation, Tyler helped Montgomery County follow state mandates within a newly tightened budget,  achieve a higher accuracy level than reappraisal projects in the past and increase taxpayer confidence and support.” Bill Loy, Assistant Auditor, Montgomery County, Ohio
 











Courts & Justice
“We've been using Odyssey for eight years. We’ve established a technology foundation and can advance the product with new features and functionalities that we couldn’t do in our old system.”Caren Skipworth, Chief Information Officer, Collin County, Texas
 











Software for the People Who Serve the Public
Our software products and services are designed specifically for the people who serve the public — police officers, teachers, financial directors, 911 dispatchers, clerks, administrators, trial judges, prosecutors, tax collectors, appraisers, justices of the peace,  school bus drivers, property appraisers, parks & rec staff  — all of the public sector employees that keep our cities, counties, and states moving forward.City software, county software, local government software, state software, government management software, school management software — these are the kind of solutions we provide to the public sector.
 











ERP | Financial
“Tyler Cashiering’s convenience fee processing is a quick and easy way of reducing expenditures, without reducing services and without any additional work from staff.”Desmond Chin, Finance Director, Village of Palmetto Bay, Florida
 











Planning, Permitting & Licensing
“One of the greatest benefits of EnerGov has been the elimination in keying in the GL account information as this is now handled automatically and it is completed as soon as the invoice is created.”Mark Meyers, Building Official, City of Clovis, California
 











Tyler Leads Public Sector Software Companies
At Tyler we know the public sector inside and out, we understand your business processes and the pressures you face — from the public, the media and other government organizations. We have an insider’s understanding of how to build, install, train and maintain the most reliable, best-in-class, long-term public sector software solutions.This is why we are so passionate about our work — partnering with local government and schools to help you work smarter, not harder, and providing efficient and innovative means to improve citizen services.
 











Schools
“We made the change to Versatrans because we wanted to see immediate results and cost savings to the district. A dollar saved in the transportation department is a dollar that can be spent on a child’s education.”BJ Ison, Saint Paul Public Schools, Minnesota
 











Mission-Critical Public Sector Software Systems
From the courtroom to the classroom, Tyler makes it easier for you to manage complex, mission-critical functions — payroll, court administration, 911 dispatch, utility billing, property valuation, tax collections, student information, school bus routing, public records management, permitting, licensing, land management.Our public sector solutions give you the tools to manage your day-to-day business needs — ERP software, state and local government software, municipal software, school management software, tax software and so much more.
 











Appraisal & Tax
“Residential and commercial staff members especially benefit from this solution. What used to be a tedious and potentially lengthy process can now be accomplished in seconds, without having to call citizens back with answers to their value questions.”Chris Lewis, CIO, Leon County Property Appraiser's Office, Florida
