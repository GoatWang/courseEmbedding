FNB Fraud Center helps secure our cardholders’ information and protect against fraudulent transactions 24/7.  If suspicious transactions are detected, a fraud analyst will attempt to contact you by phone, text and e-mail to verify the authenticity of the suspicious ATM/Debit transaction.  The fraud analyst may ask you to provide some information to help identify you as the cardholder.  The fraud analyst will NEVER ask you for your complete debit card number, PIN, full Social Security Number, or account number.  The Fraud Center approved times for contacting cardholders are 8 AM – 9 PM by phone call, 7 AM – 9 PM by text, and 24/7 by e-mail alerts.
Your card will be immediately disabled if fraud is confirmed.  If you cannot be contacted, your card may be temporarily blocked until the transaction can be verified.


 When suspicious card activity occurs, nobody is better equipped to handle the case than you.  With FNB Guardian, you can receive text alerts* on pre-determined transactions.  If the transaction meets certain criteria you will receive a text message on your cell phone to alert you of the transaction.  You then have 12 hours to respond on whether the transaction is fraudulent.  If it is a valid transaction then there is no need to respond.

To register for this FREE service, please click here FNB Guardian.  You may discontinue the receipt of alerts immediately by texting the word STOP in reply or unsubscribe entirely through the website.

The number of alerts you receive will be based on your card usage.  Some mobile service providers require that you are notified every 30 days of your subscription.  These providers are Sprint, Nextel, Boost and Virgin.  If at any time, you need help with this service you may reply HELP to the alert or click on the Service Usage Guide on the website.
