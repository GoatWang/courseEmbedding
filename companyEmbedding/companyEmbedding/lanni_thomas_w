What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Patent number:  8354760
                                            

Abstract:  Power supply equipment includes low power assemblies and high power assemblies, each of which is detachably mateable to either one of two power ports. To simultaneously power two low power devices, low power assemblies are respectively mated to each of the power ports. To simultaneously power one low power and one high power device, a low power assembly is mated to one of the power ports and a high power assembly is mated to the other power port. The low power assemblies transfer a low DC voltage, but not a high DC voltage, to low power devices. The high power assemblies transfer a high DC voltage, but not a low DC voltage, to high power devices. If a high power assembly is mated to each of the power ports, power flow is interrupted without putting the power supply in an overvoltage or overcurrent condition.

SYNCHRONOUS AC RECTIFIED FLYBACK CONVERTER UTILIZING BOOST INDUCTOR



Publication number:  20120314456
                                            

Abstract:  A flyback converter utilizes a boost inductor coupled between a source of AC power and a synchronous rectifier to provide power factor correction. The synchronous rectifier includes four field-effect transistors configured in a bridge arrangement. Control circuitry controls the on/off states of opposite pairs of the FETs to provide synchronous rectification of the AC power. A primary winding of the flyback transformer is coupled in series with a storage capacitor across the output of the synchronous rectifier. A circuit, which includes a switching transistor, is also coupled across the output of the synchronous rectifier to provide a low resistance path when the switch is closed. The cores of the boost inductor and the transformer are loaded with energy when the switch is closed. When the switch opens, the energy stored in the magnetic cores is transferred to the output via the transformer secondary winding and rectification circuitry.

Power supply with low touch-temperature surface



Publication number:  20110228486
                                            

Abstract:  A power supply provides a low touch-temperature surface by utilizing a plurality of spaced apart pegs which extend from a surface of a case away from heat generating components enclosed within the case. The top and side surfaces of the pegs and the surface of the case not occupied by the pegs are entirely directly exposed to ambient air. The tops of the pegs provide a touch surface having a temperature which is cooler than that at the base of the pegs. The pegs are preferably arranged to minimize heat transfer between adjacent pegs.

Detachable tip for communicating with adapter and electronic device



Patent number:  7999412
                                            

Abstract:  A detachable tip is used in conjunction with a power adapter to provide DC power to an electronic device. The tip includes an input connector which detachably mates with a connector which is electrically coupled to the power adapter. An output connector of the tip detachably mates with the electronic device. Conductors within the tip transfer the DC power from the input connector to the output connector to provide the DC power to the electronic device. Circuitry within the tip transmits to the electronic device, via the output connector, a power output indication signal representative of an amount of power available to be supplied to the electronic device by the adapter.

Discrepancies Mar Account of Death of Boy, 7 :  Accident: Parents say that their son wouldn't have been killed as he stepped from school bus if the district followed safety procedures. - latimes

YOU ARE HERE: LAT Home→Collections→Accidental DeathsDiscrepancies Mar Account of Death of Boy, 7 :  Accident: Parents say that their son wouldn't have been killed as he stepped from school bus if the district followed safety procedures.April 29, 1994|MARK I. PINSKY | TIMES STAFF WRITER


LAGUNA NIGUEL — The school district said Thursday it is investigating the death of a 7-year-old struck by a truck after he got off a school bus, an accident his parents said could have been avoided if the district had followed safety procedures.Thomas E. Lanni, 7, was hit by a pickup truck on April 22 as he crossed Aliso Niguel Road. He died at the hospital.Two days after the funeral, Thomas W. Lanni, 41, said he was "infuriated" by an account of his son's death released after the accident by the Capistrano Unified School District."It's incomprehensible to me that this situation should be allowed to exist," he said. "They're trying to blame my son, and he's totally innocent."Jacqueline Price, a spokeswoman for the district, said last week that the school bus had not been displaying flashing lights to warn drivers of children disembarking, because all six of the children who get off at that stop live on the same side of the street.But parents of four of those children said Thursday that they live across the street.State law requires school buses to display flashing lights to stop traffic in both directions "when children are unloading from the school bus to cross a highway."Price acknowledged Thursday that four students do live on the other side of the street. But because the bus normally has pulled away by the time they cross, the driver is not required by law to flash his warning lights, she said."What we don't know at this point is just what happened and why," Price said. "We're still talking to students and parents and trying to get a sense of what happened."Price acknowledged that there were several major discrepancies in the district's initial account of the accident. "We weren't intentionally inaccurate," she said, "but we had limited information at the time."Barbara Lanni, 36, said her family moved to Orange County from New York only a week before the accident. She enrolled her son at Marian Bergeson Elementary School last Tuesday, and brought him to and from the school on Wednesday, his first day of classes."He had a wonderful day," she recalled. When she offered to accompany him into the classroom, he replied, "No, Mommy, I'll go in myself."At the school's encouragement, she signed up for the bus and waited with him Thursday morning at the stop in front of her development."I physically got on the bus with Tommy, so he would feel OK, and introduced him to the other kids," she said. "I told the bus driver that I was his mother. I specifically told him that my son was new, and that he did not know the area at all, that he was completely unfamiliar with the area. He said, 'Don't worry, I'll take care of him.' I trusted him."School officials confirmed the substance of Barbara Lanni's conversation with the driver, whom district officials have declined to identify. He could not be reached for comment.At 3 p.m., Lanni said, she was waiting at the stop for her son, but the bus never arrived at Ambassador Place and Aliso Niguel.But one stop earlier, at El Pilar and Aliso Niguel, Thomas Lanni speculated, his son may have become confused as the bus passed a nearby shopping center."He knew he was close to home," Lanni said, "he was just unsure."Lanni was the first child off the bus, and was hit when a pickup truck pulled around the bus.At the top of the hill, Barbara Lanni said she waited and waited for her son."I didn't know what happened," she said, "but I had a bad feeling. . . . I was at a loss as to where my little boy was going to be."After driving down the hill to the accident scene, she said, "I ran up to the bus and I looked around and Tommy wasn't on the bus--I wished to God he was. I ran up to one of the officers and asked him if they had seen a little boy in a yellow shirt, but he didn't want to look at me."After the accident, Price said that Thomas had darted into traffic to greet friends across the street.But parents and children at the stop said the boy did not run into the street to greet friends. He had just moved to the area and knew no one, and, in any case, witnesses said, there were no children across the street at the time of the accident.Price said the district's earlier statement "was probably conjecture. . . . We don't know why he ran across the street."Speed limit signs along Aliso Niguel Road also are a source of controversy.Residents of the area said they have been demanding speed limit and "Children at Play" signs for years. They maintain that two signs bracketing the accident site were erected the weekend after the boy's death.Joan L. Eaton, who picks up her granddaughter at the stop each day, recorded in a log kept since the accident that city workers erected the two signs about noon on Sunday following the accident.However, city Traffic Engineer Dave Rogers said the signs went up two days before the fatal collision.1 | 2 |  Next
