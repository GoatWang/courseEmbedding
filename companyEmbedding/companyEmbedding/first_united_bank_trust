Super nice tellers - and they speak Spanish too! Right across from Swaim Serum Co where I get low cost flea/tick control for the pets and just down the street from Cattleman's or Los Comales - both are excellent restaurants with amazing delicious ranch/ranchero style menus so go love you some Cowtown!!

Vision
To be a committed partner in the communities we serve while building shareholder value through engaged employees and satisfied customers
About us
First United Bank and Trust Company is a real community bank, formed in 1996 to fill a need for traditional, personal banking in the area. Today, even though we’ve grown, our roots remain in community banking. Our focus is to support the communities we serve with the best possible products and services. But equally as important, is our support of the quality of life and economies in our market, not only financially, but through hard work and volunteerism. 
We live in the communities we serve. Our staff is our bank family, and we are proud to have every member. We employ only the best, well-trained bankers, insuring our service to our customers is second to none. Our products and services are progressive, as we pride ourselves on staying up to date with constantly changing technology.  
Our customers know us, they call us by name and call on us, individually, when they need help. We help them start out in life with a first house, a first car or even a first business. Or, we save them from the arms of big banks and bring them home to personal service and a real relationship. This is what we were built to do; it is our purpose.
We invite you to come by one of our locations in Beaver Dam, Madisonville or Earlington and enjoy a fresh baked cookie, while we tell you more about our bank.

History[edit]
First United[4] began as Durant National Bank[5] on Oct. 2, 1900 when it first opened its doors in Blue County, Choctaw Nation Territory, which is known today as Durant, Oklahoma. In 1915, Durant National Bank absorbed eight banks in the Oklahoma region, and in 1916, constructed a new building in Durant at 2nd and Main Streets. In 1963, Durant National Bank was renamed to Durant Bank & Trust becoming one of the first banks in Oklahoma to have full trust powers.
Oklahoma native, John Massey joined Durant Bank & Trust in 1966 as a director, and was appointed chairman of the board in 1986. At that time, he also became the majority shareholder and CEO. Greg Massey, joined the bank in 1990, and succeeded his father as CEO in 2003 when the bank had 18 locations in Oklahoma. A series of acquisitions, including the merger with American Bank of Texas in 2016,[6] has allowed the bank to grow to 85 locations in Oklahoma and Texas with $5.5 billion of assets.

Good Community Bank

First United Bank & Trust is a great community bank that truly understands the population it serves.  Its branches are mostly located in more rural/ suburban settings.  I have always felt that they will go the extra mile to help me out whenever they can.  The tellers have always been friendly and the managers professional and courteous.  What attracted me to this bank was their rates for savings accounts, but they're service is what has kept me here.  I happy to be a customer!

Do not use First United Bank Mortgage

We have had nothing but issues for the past 14 months that we have been with First United Bank Mortgage.  After purchasing our home we wanted to start making payments every two weeks, to pay down the principle faster.  Getting this set up was a nigthmare.  After a few months of this process not working correctly I demanded to work only with a manager.  She was helpful and able to correct the automated withdrawal issue, but then two months later the issue reappeared.  I just had yet another issue recently.  We changed home owners Insurance companies and as a result our payment went down.  I called to confirm that the payment aount was adjusted, but a day later the wrong amount came out of my account.  I called and asked why and was told that I would need to contact their ACH department to tell what the new payment should be!  I told her that they should be the ones to do that since they calculated the new amount and I asked why the individual that I spoke with the day before did not tell me this process would need to be completed.  She just very insincerely apologized and did not have anything to say.  We may end up refinancing just to switch Mortgage companies.  This company is incompetent and they have no idea what they are doing.  I was required to give at least one star but if I had a choice I would said 0.

unwilling to be flexible and work with yo.
Checking account got canceled. I took time to explain that I'm working with a small electrical company and that I will be sending a money order in to take care of my negative account. Well time transpired And they canceled my account. After I have used them and paid off my loans. Just unwilling to work n be flexible with you. That's fine I already had another bank and this one calls me if there's a problem and notifies me and works with me and is very flexible and very understanding. Works out best for everyone. First United is rude And cut throat in my eyes. They can kiss my ass!

You can't pay a car loan online from another bank ( just get an account with our bank says customer service ) what a joke. Why would I get an account with a bank that is way behind the technology curve.

A series of acquisitions, including the merger with American Bank of Texas in 2016,[6] has allowed the bank to grow to 85 locations in Oklahoma and Texas with $5.5 billion of assets.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
