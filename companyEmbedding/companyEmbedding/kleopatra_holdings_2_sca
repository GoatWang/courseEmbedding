                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Rating Action: Moody's assigns (P)B3 rating to Klöckner's new Term Loan B; downgrades CFR to B3 from B2






                    Global Credit Research - 16 Jun 2017
                









London, 16 June 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today assigned a (P)B3 
rating to Klöckner Pentaplast of America, Inc.'s 
new EUR1,580 million senior secured first lien Term Loan B (split 
between EUR and USD tranches) with a maturity of 5 years, and at 
least EUR150 million revolving credit facility (RCF) with a maturity of 
4.75 years.




Concurrently, Moody's has downgraded to B3 from B2 the corporate 
family rating (CFR) and to B3-PD from B2-PD the probability 
of default rating (PDR) of Kleopatra Holdings 2 S.C.A. 
(Klöckner), the parent of plastic film packaging manufacturer 
Klöckner Pentaplast.




Upon completion of the transaction, Moody's will withdraw 
the existing B1 instrument ratings of Klöckner Pentaplast GmbH, 
Klöckner Pentaplast of America, Inc. and KP Germany 
Erste GmbH, as well as the Caa1 senior unsecured notes rating of 
Klöckner Pentaplast of America, Inc.




The outlook on all ratings is stable.




Moody's issues provisional ratings in advance of the final sale of securities, 
and these ratings reflect Moody's preliminary credit opinion regarding 
the transaction only. Upon a conclusive review of the final documentation 
Moody's will endeavour to assign definitive ratings to the facilities. 
A definitive rating may differ from a provisional rating.




RATINGS RATIONALE




Today's rating action reflects Klöckner's announcement 
that it will issue a new EUR1.580 billion equivalent Term Loan 
B and EUR385 million Holdco notes to refinance its existing debt, 
fund the acquisition of Linpac Senior Holdings Limited (Linpac, 
unrated), a U.K.-based plastic film producer 
and thermoformer in both rigid and flexible plastics supplying into the 
food packaging industry across Europe, China and Australia, 
and finance a shareholder distribution. Both companies are owned 
by equity sponsor, Strategic Value Partners (SVP).




Moody's views negatively the intention to fund a shareholder distribution 
to SVP in the region of EUR425 million. The shareholder payout 
is further evidence of an aggressive financial policy, which is 
not in line with the rating agency's expectation that Klöckner 
will gradually reduce its leverage. SVP acquired a majority equity 
stake in Klöckner in 2012 for c.EUR200 million as part of 
a debt restructuring process. The company issued additional debt 
to fund shareholder distributions in May 2013 and April 2015 totaling 
EUR525 million.




The Holdco notes issuance will not affect the company's Moody's-adjusted 
debt/EBITDA metrics because Kleopatra Holdings 1. S.C.A., 
the issuer of the Holdco notes is located outside of the restricted borrowing 
group. The notes will be contractually and structurally subordinated 
to the Term Loan B and RCF and will have a later maturity date. 
However, subject to an available cash test and a liquidity test, 
the company intends to pay cash interest on the notes which will negatively 
impact free cash flow and liquidity.




The transaction will increase Moody's adjusted Debt/EBITDA by around 
0.3x to 7.3x including factoring, (from 6.4x 
currently to 6.6x excluding factoring), whereas Moody's 
previous expectation was that adjusted gross leverage would gradually 
reduce. The increase in leverage and weakening in Klöckner's 
credit metrics follow on from a worse than expected trading performance 
in the first half of FY 2017.




The downgrade to B3 reflects the company's very high financial leverage, 
the initial margin dilution owing to Linpac's exposure solely to 
the slower growth food and consumer packaging end markets, which 
will increase the combined company's exposure to around 50% 
from 37% and deterioration in free cash flow/debt to less than 
1%.




The acquisition of Linpac is positive for Klöckner's business 
profile as will add diversification through an extended geographic reach 
and breadth of product offering as well as broadening the combined customer 
base. With complementary products such as plastic trays and film 
lids the company will be able to offer some customers in the food sector 
a "one-stop-shop" for packaging solutions. 
The larger business will also benefit from a more balanced mix of raw 
material inputs and some expected procurement gains. The acquisition 
will create a larger group with around EUR1.9 billion of pro forma 
sales and with it increased benefits of scale.




Moody's expects adjusted leverage, to reduce driven mainly 
by increasing EBITDA from synergies generated by the acquisition of Linpac 
which the company expects to total EUR30 million per annum. The 
cost reductions will come from footprint optimization, overhead 
reductions and procurement savings, which will support margin improvements. 
In addition, the company expects to expand sales of Linpac's 
products into the U.S. through Klöckner's existing 
infrastructure and grow sales to Eastern Europe through Linpac's 
stronger customer base. Growth is also expected to come from positive 
trading performance driven by increasing volumes from Klöckner's 
recently opened additional PET production line in Thailand and launch 
of several new medical device and pharmaceutical packaging grades for 
the Asian market.




LIQUIDITY




Moody's views Klöckner's liquidity as adequate being 
supported by approximately EUR129 million in cash reserves retained on 
balance sheet after the transaction in addition to at least EUR150 million 
of undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) due in 2022. Moody's 
expects liquidity to be supported by improving cash flow generation which 
will adequately cover both maintenance and investment capex requirements. 
There will be no financial covenants on the Term Loan B and a senior secured 
leverage ratio test on the RCF when it is drawn more than 40%.




RATIONALE FOR THE STABLE OUTLOOK




The outlook on all ratings is stable. It reflects Moody's 
expectation that the solid market positions and high share of sales towards 
non-discretionary pharmaceutical and food end markets will continue 
to support the group's operating performance. It also incorporates 
Moody's assumption that the company will not embark on any further 
large debt-financed acquisitions or shareholder distributions prior 
to deleveraging the business over the next 12-18 months.




WHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP/DOWN




The rating could be upgraded if Klöckner manages to reduce adjusted 
leverage to sustainably below 6.5x, combined with free cash 
flow/debt in the mid single-digits.


The rating may come under downward pressure if trading performance deteriorates, 
or Klöckner fails to improve its credit metrics or due to weakening 
liquidity.




PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY




The principal methodology used in these ratings was Packaging Manufacturers: 
Metal, Glass, and Plastic Containers published in September 
2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.

MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

We estimate that the proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable
by us, will be approximately $     million, assuming the shares offered by us
are sold for $     per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the
cover of this prospectus.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of common stock by us in this
offering to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$     per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this
prospectus, would increase or decrease the net proceeds we receive from this
offering by approximately $     million, assuming the number of shares offered
by us, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same.
Similarly, each increase or decrease of one million shares in the number of
shares of common stock offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds
we receive from this offering by approximately $     million, assuming the
assumed initial public offering price remains the same.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we may
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States government.


The industry and markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition
for most of our packaging products is based primarily on quality, product
performance and characteristics, service and price. There are also other
companies producing competing products that are well-established in certain
markets. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging
technology, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us
to maintain technological leadership.

Our key competitors tend to focus on films based on a specific polymer, either
PET or PVC, as well as specific end-markets. We believe that we are the global
leader in the PVC market. Our competitors that focus on PVC include Bilcare, Nan
Ya, Tekni-Plex, Alfatherm and Perlen. While the PET market is more fragmented
than the PVC market, over the last decade, we have established ourselves as a
global leader in PET applications as well. Key competitors in the PET market
include Octal and Hagner. We differentiate our offerings from competitors by
selling our products directly to brand owners and end packers, or to other
companies for conversion into packaging or other products in accordance with
customers’ and end-user specifications. In addition, we have a dedicated
commercial team that works closely with our customers to create value added
product solutions and to service our customers.


Company Description
We are the leading global provider in the rigid plastic film industry with
highly complementary capabilities in semi-rigid and flexible films used in
packaging and other protective film applications. Our primary end-markets
include pharmaceutical, medical devices, and food and beverage, as well


 as
applications for other consumer and industrial products. We sell a wide range of
custom rigid plastic films, including many proprietary solutions, which we
believe provide mission-critical safety and security functions and enhance
performance or drive end-user pull-through on the shelf. We have established
ourselves as a leading supplier of rigid plastic films in the value chain for
packaging, label and surface protection, among others, due to our expertise in
compounding, formulation, calendering, extrusion, surface treatment and
converting. We believe we are the leader in many of our end-markets, with
approximately 75% of our fiscal 2016 net sales from end-markets where we hold a
top 3 market position.

Within the markets we serve, we have one of the broadest product portfolios
across a variety of polymers. Our manufacturing footprint across North America,
South America, Europe and Asia Pacific allows us to serve our customers locally,
offering customized solutions while maintaining the highest production
standards. Starting with over 250 base formulations, we have created more than
4,800 customer-driven formulations. In fiscal 2016 alone we completed more than
1,400 formulation changes, of which over 350 were on single customer requests.
The application of value-added secondary processes has resulted in a product
suite of more than 17,000 SKUs. The size and scope of our existing material
science capabilities allow us to remain a leader of innovation in the industry
and meet and exceed the unique requirements of our customers for highly
technical applications.

Our material science expertise relates to polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) and
polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), which are two of the most important polymers
in the rigid film industry. We complement our rigid film capabilities with
semi-rigid and flexible films, manufactured from other polymers such as
polyolefin (“PP”) and polystyrene (“PS”).

We are able to innovate and differentiate our products through our long-standing
(50+ year history) technical expertise and know-how in developing formulations
and customized products to meet customer needs. Our films are developed in close
collaboration with our customers to meet their specific performance requirements
to preserve, protect or otherwise enhance the value of their products and their
manufacturing productivity. Typically, our products represent less than 5% of
our customers’ total product cost.

We serve customers through four market-oriented segments: Pharma, Food &
Consumer Packaging, Labels and Specialties. Our core end-markets have varying,
yet complementary growth drivers and are generally non-cyclical in nature. In
our Pharma segment, we benefit from the increasing need for innovative packaging
solutions, the aging global population and increasing generic penetration. In
our Labels segment, the drive to enhance and differentiate the look and
appearance of consumer products has led to increased demand for the more vibrant
and flexible packaging capabilities provided by shrink sleeve films. In addition
to end-market specific drivers, we expect to benefit from positive macro trends
such as a growing middle class in emerging markets and increasing spending on
consumer and healthcare products.

We have a diverse mix of approximately 3,700 customers ranging from 
multinational companies to mid-size regional and local specialty companies. We
enjoy long-term relationships with our customers and continue to serve 96% of
our top 50 customers from 2012. In addition, each of our top 10 customers has
been a customer for over 10 years, and no single customer represented more than
4% of fiscal 2016 revenue.

We believe that we are the only rigid plastic film manufacturer with a global
operating platform complemented by local capabilities, evidenced by our 19
manufacturing facilities across North America, South America, Europe and Asia
Pacific. As of September 30, 2016, including the Farmamak Acquisition (as
described below), we had approximately 600,000 tons of capacity for calendering
and extruding and approximately 110,000 additional tons of capacity for
secondary processes such as laminating and coating. Our manufacturing footprint
is supported by a global network of technical innovation engineers developing
solutions in partnership with our commercial sales organization. Our global
presence, capabilities and scale help ensure consistency and certainty of supply
of our products.

We are led by our CEO, Wayne Hewett, formerly President and CEO of Arysta
LifeScience, and CFO, R. Brent Jones, formerly interim CFO of Pall Corporation.
We do business in approximately 80 countries worldwide, and our long tenured and
well trained workforce of approximately 3,600 associates has an average tenure
of more than a decade at the Company.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
