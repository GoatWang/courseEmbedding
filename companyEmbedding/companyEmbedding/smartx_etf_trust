The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted.






Performance shown may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers. Certain funds may have contractual or voluntary fee waivers that result in a Net Expense Ratio.

Guinness Atkinson Unveils ‘SmartX’ Brand

September 16, 2013 




 
Hannah Tool 





 



  



The firm plans to dub its proposed ETF arm ‘SmartX ETF Trust.’


Guinness Atkinson, following up on an exemptive relief filing from early spring of this year, filed updated paperwork on Sept. 10 saying its exchange-traded funds would take on the brand name “SmartX.”
The first fund to come into play from this filing was branded in the prospectus as the SmartX Nasdaq Quality Dividend Index ETF. The fund will track the Nasdaq SmartX Quality Dividend Index, which rules out all holdings but those with at least $1 billion in market cap and a history of at least 10 years with 10 percent or more per year in returns on invested capital.
By placing a unique brand name on its ETF arm, Guinness Atkinson Asset Management, an issuer known for actively managed mutual funds that focus on alternative energy and Asia, signals that the preliminary prospectus of its dividend ETF, which it filed shortly after the initial exemptive filing, will be updated before long to include a price tag, ticker and the updated name of the ETF.
“Exemptive relief” grants fund firms exceptions to certain parts of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Recently, many such filings have included a request to market actively managed funds, which are generally more expensive to investors than funds that track an index.
Guinness Atkinson’s decision to passively invest its funds may be a signal that the firm could gain traction more easily than other newcomers, since only 62 of the now-more-than 1,500 ETFs on the market are active, according to IndexUniverse’s ETF screener.
These filings generally take about a year to bring a fund to fruition, though, so the trend of the recently active filings will take time to play out in the actual markets.

7 ETFs To Be Excited For In 2014
by Daniela Pylypczak-Wasylyszyn on January 3, 2014 | ETFs Mentioned: PKW









With 2013 in the books, the ETF industry looks to be gearing up for yet another year of growth and innovation. Last year, investors welcomed a slew of new exchange-traded products, including several new first-to-market products: the FTSE Portugal 20 ETF (PGAL), the Nashville Area ETF (NASH), and the Nigeria Index ETF (NGE). Though some new funds struggled to gain traction, other 2013 launches were quite successful; the Barclays ETN+ FI Enhanced Global High Yield ETN (FIGY) raked in more than $1.3 billion in assets, while the Barclays ETN+ FI Enhanced Europe 50 ETN (FEEU) saw $1 billion in inflows [see The Most Successful New ETFs of 2013].
Democratization remains a driving theme in the ETF universe and investors have been quick to take advantage of cost-efficient products offering access to increasingly popular asset classes. And though 2014 has just begun, ETF issuers are already filling the product pipelines. Below, we take a look at seven ETFs investors should be excited for in 2014:
International BuyBack Achievers Portfolio
After launching its highly successful Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW, B) in 2006, Invesco PowerShares announced that it will be debuting its international version of the fund sometime this year. The International BuyBack Achievers Portfolio will track the NASDAQ International BuyBack Achievers Index, a broad-based index that invests in foreign companies classified as “BuyBack Achievers.” To be included in the index, companies must have reduced, through repurchases, the number of their outstanding shares by at least 5% in the past 12 months [see 14 Rapid Fire ETF Ideas for 2014].
The main appeal behind this strategy is relatively straightforward: if a company is buying back its own stock, management must believe that shares are undervalued, which can be interpreted as a signal to the market that shares are mispriced as they are likely discounted. In other words, a stock repurchase program can be seen as a sign of confidence, which may potentially bolster the stock price higher as more and more investors take notice.
International Hedged Dividend Growth Fund
WisdomTree announced in 2013 that it plans to add another currency hedged ETF to its lineup this year, but this time with a focus on international dividends. The International Hedged Dividend Growth Fund will track the WisdomTree International Hedged Dividend Growth Index, which is designed to provide exposure to dividend-paying common stocks with growth characteristics of companies in the industrialized world, excluding Canada and the United States, while at the same time neutralizing exposure to fluctuations of the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
The fund will consist of roughly 300 companies from WisdomTree’s DEFA Index (Dividend index of Europe, Far East Asia, and Australia), and will be ranked by certain growth and quality factors. The fund will feature exposure to 15 developed countries, including Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Australia, and Singapore .
Market Vectors All China ETF
Van Eck filed regulatory paperwork with the SEC for permission to create a passively managed equity ETF that would hold every kind of share class of Chinese companies. The All China ETF will track a market-cap weighted index (which is currently unnamed), that consists of Chinese companies that are traded in a variety of share classes, including China A-Shares, China B-Shares, China H-Shares, China Red Chips, and China P-Chips, along with Chinese companies listed in the United States and Singapore.
Investors should note, however, that because Van Eck s not a qualified foreign institutional investor it invests directly in A-Shares using an A-Share quota of an unspecified subadvisor [see the Best and Worst Country ETFs of 2013].
Ark Genomics Revolution ETF
The Los Angeles-based Ark Investment Management LLC is hoping to make its debut in the ETF world with the launch of several unique ETFs, one of which is the Genomics Revolution ETF. The ETF will primarily invest in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are expected to benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvements and advancements in scientific research that are relevant to the theme of genomics.
According the to prospectus, the healthcare fund will focus on companies that are involved in “extending and enhancing the quality of human and other life.” These types of companies within the healthcare sector may include manufacturers and distributors of health care equipment and supplies, owners and operators of health care facilities, health maintenance organizations and managed health care plans, health care providers and issuers that provide services to health care providers [see Best and Worst Sector ETFs of 2013].
SmartX Nasdaq Quality Dividend Index ETF
In its recent SEC filing, Guinness Atkinson Asset Management, an issuer known for its actively managed mutual funds focused on alternative energy and Asia, outlined plans for the SmartX Nasdaq Quality Dividend Index ETF. The fund will track the Nasdaq Quality Dividend Index, which is comprised of companies that meet a number of requirements regarding cash flow return on invested capital, dividend payment history, and debt-to-equity.
The fund will also be equal-weighted, and will offer exposure to a variety of countries including the U.S., the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, China (including Hong Kong), Canada, and Australia.
Isolated U.S. Dividend Growth Index ETF
Another ETF newcomer, Reality Shares Advisors plans to launch three new dividend funds, one of which is the Isolated U.S. Dividend Growth Index ETF. The fund will rack an index that reflects the level of “implied dividends” on a select group of large capitalization securities listed for trading in the U.S [see The Best and Worst Performing Dividend ETFs of 2013].
The term “implied dividends” is sometimes used to refer to the level of dividends an issuer is expected to pay during a given time period. The fund will use a combination of long positions in both stocks and ETFs, as well as long and short positions in options based on U.S. large capitalization equity securities and indexes comprised of U.S. large capitalization equity securities such as the S&P 500 Index and NASDAQ 100 Index.
RBA Industrial Renaissance ETF
First Trust shared its plans to roll out its new American Industrial Renaissance ETF, which will track the Richard Bernstein Advisors American Industrial Renaissance Index. The fund’s underlying index is designed to measure the performance of small and mid cap U.S. companies in the industrial and community banking sectors.
The investment thesis for this fund is based on RBA’s belief that the United States may regain industrial market share, based on factors such as access to cheap energy sources, the growing availability of bank financing for manufacturers, and the relative stability of the U.S. market compared with any emerging markets.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
