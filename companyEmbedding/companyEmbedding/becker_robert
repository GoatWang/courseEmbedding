“Take Back Your Power” - Robert C. Beck, D.Sc.








Dr. Robert C. (Bob) Beck, D.Sc.
 Bob Beck created the Beck Protocol, a natural health, bioelectric protocol 

            designed to help the body heal itself. His passion for using electrotherapy 

            technology to help us heal led him to develop five ways to improve health. 

            Four of the steps work together and have become known as the Beck 

            Protocol or the Bob Beck protocol.

The first of the four steps is the use of microcurrents of electricity known as micropulsing or blood electrification. The second step is magnetic pulsing, the application of a pulsed magnetic field. Drinking ionic colloidal silver is the third step and drinking ozonated water is the fourth. The fifth way applies mild frequencies to harmonize and relax the brain using his Brain Tuner, also known as the Bio Tuner.
People who try the Beck Protocol come from all walks of life. Some are 

            looking for a way to gain better health, others are facing a health challenge

            or are at a point where established health protocols have failed them. One 

            comment we hear from many that try the Beck Protocol is that they have 

            come to realize that our health is up to each of us. As you learn more about 

            Bob Beck and the Beck Protocol, let your heart be your guide in order to 

            decide if this is right for you. This is an opportunity, as Bob would say, to 

            “Take Back Your Power.”
Robert C. Beck or, as he preferred, Bob Beck, was a champion of the people 

            in health matters. He believed in freely sharing what he discovered. 
 As the official source of information about Bob Beck and the health legacy he 

            gave to the world, we honor his accomplishments and celebrate his life. His 

            legacy continues through this website as we continue to share more about 

            the Beck Protocol and the Brain Tuner. Interviews with Bob, Bob’s personal 

            effects, his lectures, the experiences of those who use the Beck units, as 

            well as interviews with those who knew him well, are our resources for the 

            information you read here. 
The Beck Protocol
The Beck Protocol was developed gradually from 1991 to 1997. It is a 

            bioelectric, natural health protocol designed to help the body heal itself. 

            The first step is known as micropulsing, blood electrification or microcurrent 

            therapy. The second step is magnetic pulsing, the third is drinking ionic

            colloidal silver and the fourth part is drinking ozonated water. The Beck

            Protocol appears to have a positive effect on the immune system, at a very 

            basic level, to help our bodies with a wide variety of health challenges.
The Beck Protocol
Brain Tuner or Bio Tuner
The Brain Tuner was developed by Bob Beck in 1983. He was among the first to simplify a cranial electrical stimulation (CES) type unit to make it easy to use in the home. The application of healing frequencies to the head is known to enhance brain function which helps decrease stress and anxiety as well as improve memory and sleep. The Brain Tuner has also been used for help with addictions.

Gentle Electricity Heals
Micropulsing is zapping the blood with electricity. The electricity used is a very gentle form, known as microcurrents. Microcurrents have been used in medical devices like pacemakers, TENS devices and others for many decades. Microcurrents of electricity are considered safe. 
Micropulsing, the application we are going to discuss, involves applying gentle microcurrents to the blood. These microcurrents are created using a unit powered by a small battery. The microcurrents are introduced to the body by placing two small electrodes on the wrist. There are two arteries in each arm that come close to the surface at the wrists. The electrodes are targeting these two arteries.
In 1990 a remarkable discovery was made. 
Two medical doctors, Stephen Kaali and William Lyman, from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, discovered that applying microcurrents to cultured white blood cells infected with viruses disabled the viruses without affecting normal healthy cells. In 1991, the potential of this research discovery was announced in Science News magazine:

Zapping the AIDS virus with low–voltage electric current can nearly eliminate its ability to infect human white blood cells cultured in the laboratory, ....
William D. Lyman and his colleagues found that exposure to 50 to 100 microamperes of electricity—comparable to that produced by a cardiac pacemaker—reduced the infectivity of the AIDS virus (HIV) by 50 to 95 percent. Their experiments ... showed that the shocked viruses lost the ability to make an enzyme crucial to their reproduction, and could no longer cause the white cells to clump together—two key signs of virus infection. 
The finding could lead to tests of implantable electrical devices or dialysis–like blood treatments in HIV–infected patients, Lyman says. In addition, he suggests that blood banks might use electricity to zap HIV, and vaccine developers might use electrically incapacitated viruses as the basis for an AIDS vaccine.1[Editor’s Note: Emphasis is ours.]

The following year, after interviewing Dr. Steven Kaali, Longevity magazine added:

... most of the AIDS viruses in a blood sample will lose their infectious capability after being zapped by a very low–level current. Repeated exposure appears to leave blood virtually free of HIV, as well as hepatitis—without harming blood cells.2

It is important to note that the research in the lab at Albert Einstein College of Medicine was based on taking the blood out of the body to expose it to microcurrents and was conducted in a laboratory setting.3
So, what happened as a result of this ground-breaking research? What happened since 1990 to improve health and save lives all over the world? Nothing. The patent filed based on this research was sold, and nothing more happened. 
Modern medicine has ignored this astounding discovery.
Enter Bob Beck.

Robert C. Beck D.Sc., a retired physicist, had been developing sensitive instrumentation and exploring electromedicine for most of his career. In 1991, when he learned of the research by Kaali and Lyman he was immediately inspired:

“It occurred to me in a flash of light, why take the blood out of the body. Why not leave it in there where it belongs.”4

Micropulsing was born.


Based on all the research Bob Beck was already aware of, he felt this discovery would have far wider applications than any one disease. He wondered if this was a way our Creator had left a back-door to help our bodies heal—using electricity. It would take only a few years to show that electricity does indeed have far wider applications for healing. 
Bob Beck believed the public had a right to choose to use safe, simple technology. Bob’s design for passing microcurrents through blood brought the use of gentle electricity for healing directly to the public. His design allowed micropulsing to be easily used at home, the office or outdoors.
Bob affectionately called applying microcurrents to blood, “blood electrification.” He also described his unit as a “blood purifier” or as a “blood cleaner.”
Bob Beck’s inspiration, to apply gentle electricity to the blood in an easy-to-use way, worked—it boosted the body’s ability to heal itself. 



How to Use the Bob Beck Unit



The micropulsing unit to apply microcurrents for blood electrification is simple to use—two electrodes are placed on the skin over the arteries on each side of the wrist. One electrode is placed over the Radial artery on the thumb side of the wrist, and the other electrode is placed over the Ulnar artery, on the little finger side of the wrist. The blood comes closer to the surface of the skin at these pulse points. 
The basic protocol suggests building up the time from as little as 10 minutes a day to a minimum of two hours or more per day. Micropulsing may speed up the normal body cleansing process, referred to as detoxification or detoxing. Starting slowly helps avoid any flu-like or 

other detox symptoms. Building up to a minimum of two hours a day is suggested in order to expose enough of the circulating blood to the microcurrents being applied to the wrist. Bob stressed the importance of drinking plenty of water when micropulsing, to help eliminate toxins.
Once started, micropulsing should be applied for a minimum of six weeks. For more serious challenges and for details on a maintenance program, we’ve created a handy reference guide.
Guide to Using the Beck Protocol


The Electrical Nature of the Body
It turns out the electrical nature of the body has long been studied by researchers.
Electrically speaking, Dr. Harold Saxton Burr PhD, discovered that sick body cells such as cancer cells, have a different voltage than normal healthy cells.5 Is it possible that micropulsing helps restore normal voltage to unhealthy cells?
We also know the body has an awesome ability to heal itself when the immune system is working well. Research done in Switzerland and reported in Science & Vie, has shown that white blood cells, a key part of the blood’s immune system, function electrically.6 Our white blood cells electrocute disease-causing pathogens in the blood. 
To explore fascinating ways electricity helps us heal, check “Microcurrents for Healing”
Microcurrents for Healing

Given the evidence for the electrical nature of our bodies and the healing process, it is not so surprising that adding a mild flow of electricity to the blood, by simply placing electrodes over the two main arteries on the wrist, would boost the body’s ability to heal itself.



The Beck Protocol Is Born
Currently, the effectiveness of micropulsing has not gained mainstream medical attention. However, its popularity continues to grow among those looking for more natural ways to health. Today, individuals share their testimonials with others, and with us, about how they have restored their health. The use of the Beck units now spans the globe. 
As Bob gained experience with and received feedback from individuals using micropulsing, he saw the need for three additional steps to help the body to heal. 
All four steps are designed to work together for greater effectiveness. Each part of the Beck Protocol is a powerful tool for health on its own… feel free to use each individually.
The Beck Protocol was born. 
The four parts of the Beck Protocol work in harmony to boost the healing process:

Micropulsing
Magnetic pulsing
Ionic colloidal silver

About Us

 As the founder of the Bob Beck Legacy Association, I have the honor of caring for the effects and 
        personal papers of Dr. Robert C. Beck, DSc.
Bob Beck’s contributions to humanity and his highly interesting life are largely unknown. He had no children, so there is no family to carry on the memory of all he did and who he was. Because of this I am grateful to be able to play a part in sharing Bob’s work with you as a tribute to who he was—a physicist with a wide range of accomplishments, an inventor who had a passion to apply technology for the betterment of mankind, and a man with many interests. Bob was truly a 
        renaissance man. I am especially grateful to be caring for this site on behalf of the thousands of people worldwide who have personally heard his message and subsequently enjoy the benefits of improved health, as well as those who have yet to discover the benefits of his work.
I gratefully acknowledge the small, merry band of individuals who have helped with this project. We have nothing to sell so we can freely share the most responsible, accurate and balanced information about The Beck Protocol.
My personal background with the Bob Beck Protocol and exposure to the regulatory climate of government concerning health started when I worked for a manufacturer from 2000 to 2003. Most of my time I worked as their regulatory correspondent with government and as their clinical study facilitator. That was an eye-opening education for me, as until that time, I had no idea of the bias that exists in the scientific and medical establishments as well as among government regulators. My experience ignited a passion within me to bring the news about the work of Bob Beck to all who are interested. So, after some world travels, I am happy to be the caretaker for this site.
I invite you to browse and enjoy the testimonials as well as the in-depth information about Bob, his work and his legacy.
Welcome! ~Vicki

The Beck Protocol stories show us the potential health benefits
                        of blood electrification, magnetic pulsing, drinking ionic silver and ozonated water.
                    

                        We live in a global environment where only "politically correct" and immensely profitable
                        medical protocols are explored. This means the formal research we would like to
                        have is too expensive and the results would take years to become accessible. It
                        would also make this technology unaffordable for the average person. Instead, it
                        is through these testimonials we are able to glimpse the potential benefits and
                        limitations of this safe and low-cost technology. We are deeply grateful to those
                        who share their amazing health stories.
                    

                        Government regulators say that testimonials are misleading and deceptive. Like Bob
                        Beck, there are many of us who believe we have the intelligence and wisdom to choose
                        the information that will inform and support us. We choose to "Take Back Our Power".




                        Disclaimer: Please understand each story is one individual's personal experience.
                        What works for them will not necessarily work for you. Government regulators say
                        that testimonials are misleading and deceptive. Results are not typical.

Robert O. Becker MD: Research Bibliography






The father of electromedicine and electrochemically induced cellular regeneration Dr. Robert O. Becker with Paul Becker developer of the EarthPulse after testing the Sleep on Command™

 
 


Robert O. Becker circa 1970’s Syracuse NY

 
 
 



Robert Otto Becker, MD (1923 – 2008) – 5 decades of electromedical research by a man far, far ahead of his time.
The father of electromedicine and electrochemically induced cellular regeneration; a pioneer of silver plated nylon bandage in chronic wound care and regeneration of tissue. His entire bibliography with links to PubMed is offered for your education and not intended as promotional material for EarthPulse™.
In the 1970’s Becker warned that power frequency and radio wave fields were damaging to health. He lost his research funding and was forced out of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Syracuse University. If anyone deserved a Nobel in medicine, it was Bob, but they couldn’t allow a Nobel prize to a man warning about dangers of EMF. Little did he know that EMF’s were going to destroy the sleep patterns of all planetary inhabitants,
In our conversations between 2004 and 2007 when presented with the NASA Goodwin studies, he concurred that 10 Hz may just have some ‘magical’ effect. He died shortly after. It wasn’t until 2008 that I’d come up with MoreATP; The Mitochondrial Theory of Aging in Reverse how to enhance sleep, recovery, longevity and physical & mental performance very simply with pulsed magnetic fields.

Induction of local tissue regeneration in the human would best be accomplished if the patient’s own cells at the desired site could be caused to dedifferentiate into the required embryonic stem cells. A system involving the electrical iontophoretic introduction of free silver ions into human wounds for their antibiotic effect has been in clinical use since 1975. In addition to a major antibiotic effect, the technique was found to produce the regeneration of all local tissues, apparently by stimulating dedifferentiation of mature human cells. More recently the use of a newly developed silvered nylon fabric has been found to have similar results without the need for electrical parameters. The results of a preliminary laboratory and clinical study of this material are presented.

A study of the use of free silver ions as an antibacterial and antifungal agent administered to infected local wounds has been conducted over the past two decades. A variety of iontophoretic techniques has been employed utilizing either pure silver wires or several types of silvered nylon fabrics as anodes in a direct current electrical circuit. A new type of silver nylon has recently been evaluated for the same use without iontophoretic current. In vitro studies of both techniques have demonstrated an effective, broad spectrum antibiotic effect including most silver-resistant strains. Over 100 cases of recalcitrant osteomyelitis have been treated with an overall success rate of approximately 65% and no evidence of argyria.

Twenty-five patients with active, chronic osteomyelitis, resistant to conventional management, were treated with surgical debridement and daily application of electrically activated silver dressings. Sixteen (64%) cases resulted in closed, stable, pain-free wounds, with the remainder resulting in persistent drainage or amputation. Nine of 12 cases complicated by nonunion achieved union. In 13 patients an open-bone graft was performed and silver treatment continued: these tended to remain free of purulent drainage but fared no better than average in the long-term follow-up. The silver anode dressing seems to be an effective aid in the treatment of chronic bone infection when combined with adequate surgical debridement, thereby reducing the need for prolonged systemic antibiotics.

The action of a 60-Hz, 5 kV/m electric field on erythrocyte parameters in mice was determined. No effects attributable to the magnitude of the field were found, but a transition either from or to an environment containing the field caused decreased red blood cell concentrations and decreased hematocrits. The failure of others to observe effects on erythrocyte parameters following exposure to low-frequency electric fields may have been due to an inappropriate choice of duration of exposure.

Marino AA, Spadaro JA, Fukada E, Kahn LD, Becker RO, Piezoelectricity in collagen films, Calcified Tissue International, 1980;31(3):257-9, PMID: 6781732
Tissue collagen exhibits several levels of structural organization, and this complicates efforts to determine the origin of its piezoelectricity. We made collagen films-by evaporation and electrodeposition from solution-and examined the relation between collagen’s piezoelectricity and its electron microscopic appearance. We found that the electrodeposited films were more organized and exhibited higher piezoelectric coefficients than the evaporated films. Despite this, the evaporated films were piezoelectric, thereby suggesting that the effect originates either at the level of the tropocollagen molecule or, at most, with aggregated structures no larger than 50 A in diameter.

Fibular osteotomies in rats were exposed to an extremely low frequency field for 14 days. By histologic evaluation it was found that the healing rate was retarded by the field. The effect (which was replicated) occurred at much lower power levels than are presently employed in electrical osteogenesis.

Spadaro JA, Webster DA, Becker RO, Silver polymethyl methacrylate antibacterial bone cement, Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research, 1979 Sep;(143):266-70, PMID: 509832
An improved antibacterial bone cement was sought based on the addition of low concentrations of inorganic silver compounds to polymethyl methacrylate. Composites with AgCl, Ag-AgCl, Ag2O, Ag2SO4 and Ag3PO4 in concentrations of 0.05% to 1% by weight, were tested in vitro against bacterial cultures. All were effective, but Ag2SO4 was especially so, even after 7 weeks of incubation in normal saline. Compressive strength of the cement was not affected by these additions, except in the case of Ag2O. Biocompabibility tests in rabbit muscle for up to 12 weeks showed no significant difference between the Ag -PMM and plain PMM in tissue reactivity, both being minimal. These features, coupled with the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and low allergic potential of silver, make Ag-PMM an attractive alternative to conventional organic antibiotic/bone cement composites.

Reichmanis M, Marino AA, Becker RO, Laplace plane analysis of impedance on the H meridian, The American journal of Chinese medicine, 1979 Summer;7(2):188-93, PMID: 484540
The AC impedance of a length of the H meridian not containing any acupuncture points was studied by means of Laplace plane analysis of the time domain response to an input voltage pulse. The ensuing frequency domain data were compared to the results of an identical analysis for two anatomically similar controls on either side of the meridian. The resistance of the meridian was significantly lower than either control.

Becker RO, The significance of electrically stimulated osteogenesis: more questions than answers, Clinical Orthopedics and Related Research, 1979 Jun;(141):266-74, PMID: 314373
The present technique of electrical osteogenesis represents the rediscovery of a method in clinical use over 100 years ago. That technique while reported to have excellent clinical results, was empirically applied and was totally discredited as having no scientific basis. Modern techniques report similarly useful clinical results, but similarly lack an accepted scientific basis. The techniques in present use differ so greatly among themselves that a common mechanism of action seems highly unlikely. Yet all report excellent clinical results. Serious questions are raised concerning the validity of the claims, the mechanism of action and the possibility of long-term undesirable side effects. These questions are not insoluble and the newer physical science disciplines seem well suited to reveal the mechanism of action. Appropriate research projects must be mounted and answers to these questions obtained before the technique is made available for wide application. The importance of this procedure far transcends orthopedic surgery and bone growth stimulation and if properly pursued, it may lead to revolutionary changes, not only in basic biology, but in the practice of clinical medicine in general.

Loss of body calcium during spaceflight is a potential problem in long voyages. This loss does not appear to be caused by a deficiency in diet or exercise. The idea is advanced that the altered electromagnetic environment experienced in space may be at least partially responsible. We show that the electric field induced inside astronauts because of their motion in the geomagnetic field is greater than that which has produced a wide variety of biological effects in earth-bound experiments.

Reichmanis M, Perry FS, Marino AA, Becker RO, Relation between suicide and the electromagnetic field of overhead power lines, Physiological chemistry and physics, 1979;11(5):395-403, PMID: 542502
Laboratory studies have shown that electromagnetic fields similar to those from high-voltage transmission lines can produce biological effects. Surveys of the actual effects of such lines on exposed individuals usually have been hampered by complicating factors tending to blur the data. By means of a new approach, however, correlation has been established between the presence of transmission-line fields and the occurrence of suicides in part of the Midlands of England.

Becker RO, Spadaro JA, Treatment of orthopaedic infections with electrically generated silver ions. A preliminary report, The Journal of bone and joint surgery (American volume), 1978 Oct;60(7):871-81, PMID: 701335
Electrically generated silver ions have been shown previously to be a potent antibacterial agent with an exceptionally broad spectrum as indicated by in vitro testing. The present study reports on clinical experience using electrically generated silver ions as adjunctive treatment in the management of chronic osteomyelitis. Fourteen patients had fifteen treatment attempts: thirteen for chronic osteomyelitis of the tibia, one for acute and chronic pyarthrosis and osteomyelitis of the knee, and one for a chronically draining sinus after total hip replacement. Wound débridement, silver ion iontophoresis, and subsequent wound care (usually provided by the patient) resulted in control of the infection in twelve of the fifteen treatment attempts and in healing of the non-union after follow-up ranging from three to thirty-six months. The other three attempts led to two partial and one complete failure.

Reichmanis M, Becker RO, Physiological effects of stimulation at acupuncture loci: a review, Comparative medicine East and West, 1978 Spring;6(1):67-73, PMID: 710080
Recent studies reporting significant physiological effects associated with electrical and manual stimulation at several traditional Chinese acupuncture loci are reviewed. Other reports on the anatomy and electrical properties (DC resistance and potential, AC impedance) of these sites indicate that many are significant local skin resistance minima and may also be points of locally more positive DC potential. Further investigation of the basic properties of the acupuncture system and its mode of action is fully warranted by these preliminary findings.

Dueland R, Hoffer RE, Seleen WA, Becker RO, The effects of low voltage current on healing of thermal third degree wounds, The Cornell veterinarian, 1978 Jan;68(1):51-9, PMID: 303976
Bilateral third degree burns were created on the flanks of eight miniature swine. Each animal had one side treated daily with low intensity direct (LIDC) of 400 microamperes (muA) by contact electrode for 2 hours morning and afternoon until healing occurred. The polarity of the electrode was negative in 4 pigs and positive in 4 pigs. One group of 4 pigs had the eschar surgically removed 24 hours post burn. Weekly biopsies and cultures were taken of treated and control wounds. Results indicated: local treatment of 400 muA LIDC did not hasten or delay healing of thermal third degree burns; escharectomy hastened wound healing by 10 days, and superficial proteus infection occurred in 80% of all wounds.

Mitchell JT, Marino AA, Berger TJ, Becker RO, Effect of electrostatic fields on the chromosomes of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells exposed in vivo, Physiological chemistry and physics, 1978;10(1):79-85, PMID: 569338
An effect of electrostatic fields on the chromosomes of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells exposed in vivo has been demonstrated. Cells exposed to horizontal electrostatic fields for two weeks had almost a threefold increase in the percentage of abnormal chromosomes when compared to control cells or cells exposed to vertical electrostatic fields for the same period. Extended exposure times of 4–15 weeks resulted in the disappearance of the aberrant chromosomes. It is suggested that the effected cells were incapable of cellular replication resulting eventually in their disappearance via cell death.

The frequency dependence of the skin impedance between two acupuncture points (H-3 and H-4) was determined by Laplace plane analysis of the time domain response to an input voltage perturbation. Both the resistance and capacitance between the acupuncture points differed significantly from the corresponding controls, thus supporting the interpretation of the acupuncture system as an information transfer network.

Low intensity direct current stimulation of bone growth involves the continuous application of cathodic currents in the nanoampere range. The technique has been applied to 13 patients with a variety of non-unions and pseudarthroses with a success rate of 77 per cent. Preliminary data indicate that a range of total energy, from 0.6 to 2.5 Joules, is maximally effective. The technique has been combined with anodic control of local bacterial infection with promising results. Both the osteogenic stimulation and the bacterial suppression techniques as described in this paper, appear to be safe and effective.

One hundred seventy-four 21- to 24-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were continuously exposed to a 60 Hz electric field of 150 V/cm for one month in ten separate experiments. Biological effects observed included depressed body weights, serum corticoids, and water consumption. The findings are tentatively in terpreted as indicating that a power frequency electric field is a biological stressor. The observed effects cannot be a consequence of Joule heating and therefore indicate that electric fields can influence biological systems either at the systemic level, or at the cellular level via electrochemical alteration of the microenvironment.

A qualitative and quantitative investigation was undertaken to study the susceptibility of unicellular eucaryotic organisms (yeasts) to metallic cations generated by low levels of direct current. Results were characteristic of effects obtained previously using clinical and standard bacteria test organisms. The present study demonstrated that anodic silver (Ag(+)) at low direct currents had inhibitory and fungicidal properties. Broth dilution susceptibility tests were made on several species of Candida and one species of Torulopsis. Growth in all isolates was inhibited by concentrations of electrically generated silver ions between 0.5 and 4.7 mug/ml, and silver exhibited fungicidal properties at concentrations as low as 1.9 mug/ml. The inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations of electrically generated silver ions are lower than those reported for other silver compounds.

Ultraviolet light can be used to stimulate electrical current flow in bone and tendon. This stimulated photocurrent is directional. In tendon the photocurrent parallel to the fibrils is greater than the photocurrent perpendicular to the fibrils. In bone, the longitudinal photocurrent is less than the transverse photocurrent.

Mice were allowed to mate, gestate, deliver and rear their offspring for 3 successive generations while being continuously exposed to 60 Hz electric fields. Mice exposed to vertical electric fields exhibited decreased body weights at 35 days postpartum and increased mortality rates for 3 successive generations. Mice exposed to horizontal electric fields exhibited decreased body weights for 2 successive generations.

Skin conductance was measured in 10 subjects with a DC Wheatstone bridge in 10 areas purportedly containing acupuncture loci on the Triple Burner (TB) and Lung (Lu) meridians. When the results were compared to those from anatomically similar locations devoid of acupuncture loci, local conductance variation was found to be significantly different (p less than 0.05) in most acupuncture locus locations.

Silver, platinum, gold, stainless-steel, and copper electrodes were used with low currents (0.02 to 20 muA/mm(2)) to explore their electrochemical effects on the growth of four bacterial species. In the higher current ranges, all electrodes inhibited growth at both poles, usually in conjunction with electrolytic break-down of the medium and severe corrosion of the metal. Silver, however, was extremely bacteriostatic, even at the lowest current, when used as the anode. Quantitative studies showed that most of this inhibition takes place in a few hours and is not accompanied by changes in pH. Electrochemically injected silver from the anode is probably the instrumental agent, being effective in concentrations of about 5 mug/ml. This is the equivalent concentration of silver sulfadiazine that has been shown to give complete inhibition of bacteria, but without the sulfonamide moiety.

The amplitude of electrical potentials generated in stressed bone is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of bony deformation, while polarity is determined by the direction of bending. Areas under compression develop negative potentials with respect to other areas. Similar results were obtained both in living and dead bone. Removal of the inorganic fraction from bone abolishes its ability to generate stress potentials. It is probable that these potentials influence the activity of osseous cells directly. Furthermore, it is conceivable that they may direct, in some manner, the aggregation pattern of the macromolecules of the extracellular matrix.

The demonstrated association of the d-c bioelectric field with central nervous system elements implies the longitudinal flow of charge carriers within that system. Transverse d-c voltages, attributed to the Hall effect, have been obtained from the extremities of intact salamanders under circumstances suggesting such electric current. These voltages disappeared after nerve section, and their magnitude was related to the depth of anesthesia.

I have been using my Earthpulse for three months now and can say that it has allowed me to get good sleep.  I have narcolepsy and used to sleep four hours and then spend the rest of the night awake.  I now can sleep straight through, even with bathroom breaks.  
While it didn't fix my narcolepsy, because narcolepsy is a chemical deficiency in the brain, I  still experience "knock-out" episodes during the day when sitting in a chair, but it is not as severe.  Also be prepared for more intense dreams.
I have also used the unit to directly "treat" specific pain areas on my body and it has reduced the pain.
I have slept with it under the mattress as well as in the bed.  I adjust the strength accordingly and the benefit is just as effective.
I am a massage therapist and I tape it under the massage table and several clients have reported a strong calming effect, I use 10 Hz for those sessions.
The portability for traveling is also a great feature.
I wouldn't be without this unit.- Ron Patzer








Gaby Ross 01:12 03 Jan 17

 

























I don't have sleep problems, but I bought my EarthPulse unit to help heal a back and hip injury that I had over a year ago. For several months, I couldn't put any weight on my leg and could barely lift it a few inches off the floor. After much research, I learned about the amazing benefits of PEMF therapy but the prices of most systems out there were beyond my means. Then I discovered EarthPulse, and after careful research and comparisons, I decided to buy the least expensive model (with only one magnet) last August. 

I did't know how my body would react to the EarthPulse's PEMF, so I started at very low settings. After about three weeks, my back pain was much less, and could lift my leg higher. I've been using my EP unit almost 24/7, and now I'm using 9.6Hz at the highest amplitude setting (100%). The back pain disappeared a couple of months ago for good. I can now put quite a bit of weight on my leg and lift it almost 8" inches higher than before I started using the EP unit. I wish I had started at the higher settings from the beginning so my healing would have gone faster. 

Anyway, I'm very happy with the results so far, and I'm considering buying the model with two magnets. Customer service has been great! I had many questions, both before purchasing and after receiving the unit, and they answered quickly. I would highly recommend an EarthPulse unit to anyone.








Simon Foong 10:20 02 Dec 16

 























Its amazing and everyone should own one. I'm sleeping better, and feel more energized! Thank you Earthpulse!








Rick Contreras 22:37 12 Jul 16

 



















I'm not sure the Earth Pulse is for me.  There are times I seen to sleep well followed by nights when I can't shut down my brain long enough for sleep to come.  My night-work, day-sleep can't be helping this but this is the career I chose.  I have tried the different settings (Hz/%) but they don't really make a big difference in my overall sleep quality/quantity.  Maybe some further instruction/advice from Sleep Tech would be helpful.  I do appreciate the chance to try this unit out and I'll be genuinely sorry to have to send it back.








maryam jawid 02:18 29 Oct 16

 

















I had extremely high hopes for the earthpulse, as I have always had sleep troubles.  When I broke my ankle, I decided to finally purchase an earthpulse in order to not only improve sleep, but to use the magnet on my ankle to speed healing.  Now, after 90 days of trying different frequencies and amplitudes, I have noticed almost no improvement in sleep quality.  As for the ankle, I had to stop using the earthpulse on the ankle after about a month because my healing was actually going slower than what is typical, and putting the magnet on my ankle just caused more pain.  I hate to leave this unhappy review, but I highly encourage anyone considering an earthpulse to try to borrow one from someone before purchasing.  They do have a 90 day return policy, but shipping is never refunded, and that cost is more than a 50 dollar loss already.








Larry Hairston 17:29 18 Jan 17

 























As I have aged, it has become more difficult for me to get to sleep and stay asleep.  That is why I bought the EarthPulse.  I was having so much difficulty sleeping that the EP did not work for me at first.  I guess it was difficult for my body to get in rhythm with the device.  But after several weeks, although I still sometimes have trouble getting to sleep, once asleep, I am experiencing deep restorative sleep, often dreaming and sleeping longer.  I have mostly used program mode 3, so that may be why I sometimes still have trouble falling asleep.  I would definitely recommend the EP to anyone with insomnia.
