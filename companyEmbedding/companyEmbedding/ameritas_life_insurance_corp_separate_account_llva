Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

Term life insurance
that keeps on giving.

With Lifely Term, your family will receive monthly payments for a term you choose, up to 30 years.

Here’s an example of how Lifely Term can work.





Meet Alex Age: 34 Married w/2 kids




Where Alex fits in 
Right now, Alex is the sole earner. If he were to pass away tomorrow, he would need to provide around 20 years of financial support.




Income $70/k a year




Life without Alex 
Alex’s family needs $4k a month to manage the bills so that his wife can continue to care for the kids as planned.




Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

POLICY OVERVIEW

�
The following is intended as a summary. Please read each section
of this prospectus for additional detail.
�
The Ameritas Advisor No-Load
VA is a variable annuity savings vehicle offering a variety of investment options to help meet long-term financial goals. Its
costs are discussed in this prospectus' CHARGES and CHARGES EXPLAINED sections. You have a short time period to review
your Policy and cancel it. The terms of this "right to examine" period vary by state (see the cover of your Policy).
You can allocate your premiums among a wide spectrum of investments and transfer money from one underlying investment portfolio
to another without tax liability. In the Separate Account variable investment options, you may gain or lose money on your investment.
In the Fixed Account option, we guarantee you will earn a fixed rate of interest. The investment options are described in this
prospectus' first page and in the INVESTMENT OPTIONS section. The Policy is not designed for use by market-timing organizations
or other persons or entities that use programmed or frequent transfers among investment options. More information about our market-timing
restrictions is in the INVESTMENT OPTIONS � TRANSFERS and DISRUPTIVE TRADING PROCEDURES sections.
�


A significant advantage of the Policy is that it provides the ability to accumulate capital on a tax-deferred basis.��The purchase of a Policy to fund a tax-qualified retirement account does not provide any additional tax deferred treatment beyond the treatment provided by the tax-qualified retirement plan itself.��However, the Policy does provide benefits such as lifetime income payments, family protection through death benefits and guaranteed fees.

�
The Policy is a deferred annuity: it has an accumulation (or deferral)
period and an annuity income period.
�
Accumulation Period. During the accumulation
period, any earnings that you leave in the Policy are not taxed. During this period you can invest additional money into the Policy,
transfer amounts among the investment options, and withdraw some or all of the value of your Policy. Some restrictions may apply
to transfers (especially to transfers into and out of the Fixed Account). Withdrawals may be subject to income tax and a penalty
tax.
�
Annuity Income Period. The accumulation period ends
and the annuity income period begins on a date you select (or the later of the fifth Policy Anniversary or the Policy Anniversary
nearest the Annuitant's 85th birthday). During the annuity income period, we will make periodic payments to the Annuitant,
unless you specify otherwise. You can select payments that are guaranteed to last for the Annuitant's entire life or for some other
period. Some or all of each payment will be taxable.
�
A feature of the Policy distinguishing it from non-annuity investments
is its ability to guarantee annuity payments to you for as long as the Annuitant lives or for some other period you select. In
addition, if you die before those payments begin, the Policy will pay a death benefit to your beneficiary.
�
Guarantees, which are obligations of the general
account, are subject 
to the claims paying ability of the Company.
�
POLICY OPERATION AND FEATURES
Premiums

�Minimum initial premium: $2,000.

�Minimum additional premium: $250, or $50 per month if through a regularly billed program.

�No additional premiums will be accepted after the earlier of the Annuity Date or the Policy Anniversary nearest your 85th
birthday without our approval.

�Prior approval is required for any premium resulting in more than $1 million in total premium of all annuities with us for
the same Owner or Annuitant.
�
Investment Options

�You may transfer among investments, subject to limits. Dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweep systematic
investment programs are available.
�
Deductions from Assets
(See CHARGES on next pages.)
�
Withdrawals

�There are no withdrawal charges.

�Each withdrawal must be at least $250.

�An optional Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit 2 rider ("GLWB2") is also available.
�
Annuity Income

�Several fixed annuity income options are available.

Death Benefit

�A death benefit is paid upon the death of the Owner.
�
TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS
The Policy can be used to fund a tax-qualified plan such as an IRA,
Roth IRA (including rollovers from tax-sheltered annuities), SEP, or SIMPLE IRA. This Prospectus generally addresses the terms
that affect a non-tax-qualified annuity. If your Policy funds a tax-qualified plan, read the Tax-Qualified Plan Disclosures in
this prospectus' Appendix B to see how they might change your Policy rights and requirements. Contact us if you have questions
about the use of the Policy in these or other tax-qualified plans.

FTVIPT (1)��The Fund administration fee is paid indirectly through the management fee.

Invesco (1) �Invesco Advisers, Inc. (the "Adviser") has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the Fund's management fee in an amount equal to the net management fee that the Adviser earns on the Fund's investments in certain affiliated funds.��This Waiver will have the effect of reducing Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses that are indirectly borne by the Fund.��Unless the Adviser continues the fee waiver agreement, it will terminate on June 30, 2016. The fee waiver agreement cannot be terminated during its term.

Neuberger Berman (1)��Neuberger Berman Management LLC ("NBM") has undertaken through December 31, 2018 to waive fees and/or reimburse certain operating expenses, excluding taxes, interest, extraordinary expenses, brokerage commissions,��dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, acquired fund fees and expenses and transaction costs, that exceed, in the aggregate, 1.00% of average daily net asset value of the Portfolios.��The expense limitation arrangements for the Portfolios are contractual and any excess expenses can be repaid to NBM within three years of the year incurred, provided such recoupment would not cause a Portfolio to exceed its limitation.

Neuberger Berman (2)��Neuberger Berman Management LLC ("NBM") has undertaken through December 31, 2018 to waive fees and/or reimburse certain operating expenses, including the compensation of NBM and excluding taxes, interest, extraordinary expenses, brokerage commissions, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, acquired fund fees and expenses��and transaction costs, that exceed, in the aggregate, 1.50% of average daily net asset value of the Portfolio.��The expense limitation arrangements for the Portfolio are contractual and any excess expenses can be repaid to NBM within three years of the year incurred, provided such recoupment would not cause the Portfolio to exceed its limitation.

PIMCO (1)��"Other Fees" reflect interest expense and is based on the amount incurred during the Portfolio's most recent fiscal year as a result of entering into certain investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements.��Interest expense is required to be treated as a Portfolio expense for accounting purposes and is not payable to PIMCO.��The amount of the interest expense (if any) will vary based on the Portfolio's use of such investments as an investment strategy.��

PIMCO (2)��Total Portfolio Fees excluding interest expense is 1.02%. 

PIMCO (3)���PIMCO has contractually agreed to waive the Portfolio's advisory fee and the supervisory and administrative fee in an amount equal to the management fee and administrative services fee, respectively, paid by the PIMCO Cayman Commodity Portfolio I Ltd. (the "CRRS Subsidiary") to PIMCO.��The CRRS Subsidiary pays PIMCO a management fee and an administrative services fee at the annual rates of 0.49% and 0.20%, respectively, of its net assets.��This waiver may not be terminated by PIMCO and will remain in effect as long as PIMCO's contract with the CRRS Subsidiary is in place.

PIMCO (4)��Total Expenses after Waivers and Reductions, if any, excluding interest expense is 0.89%. 

Rydex (1)��Includes 0.55% Short Sales Dividend and Interest Expense. Short Dividend Expense occurs because the Fund short-sells equity securities to gain the inverse exposure necessary to meet its investment objective. The Fund must pay out the dividend rate of the equity security to the lender and records this as an expense of the Fund and reflects the expense in its financial statements. However, any such dividend on a security sold short generally has the effect of reducing the market value of the shorted security � thus increasing the Fund�s unrealized gain or reducing the Fund�s unrealized loss on its short sale transaction. �Short Dividend Expense� is not a fee charged to the shareholder by the Advisor or other service provider. Rather it is more similar to the transaction costs or capital expenditures associated with the day-to-day management of any mutual fund. Short Interest Expense occurs because the
Long Short Equity Fund short-sells a Bond to gain the inverse exposure necessary to meet its investment objective.��The Fund must pay out the coupon rate of the Bond to the purchaser and records this as an expense.��The expense is offset - in its entirety or in part - by the income derived from the short-sale and/or by earnings on the proceeds of the short-sale.��Short Interest Expense is not a fee charged to the shareholder by the Advisor or other service provider.��Rather, it is more similar to the transaction costs or capital expenditures associated with the day-to-day management of any mutual fund.

Rydex (2)��Includes 2.39% Short Interest Expense. Short Interest Expense occurs because the Inverse Government Long Bond Strategy Fund short-sells a Bond to gain the inverse exposure necessary to meet its investment objective. The Fund must pay out the coupon rate of the Bond to the purchaser and records this as an expense. The expense is offset � in its entirety or in part � by the income derived from the short-sale and/or by earnings on the proceeds of the short-sale. Short Interest Expense is not a fee charged to the shareholder by the Advisor or other service provider. Rather, it is more similar to the transaction costs or capital expenditures associated with the day-to-day management of any mutual fund.

Third Avenue (1)��The Fund's advisor has contractually agreed, for a period of one year from April 30, 2015, to waive receipt of advisory fees and/or reimburse Fund expenses in order to limit total annual expenses (exclusive of taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary items) to 1.30% of average daily net assets, subject to later reimbursement in certain circumstances.

UIF (1)��The Portfolios' "Adviser," Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., has agreed to reduce its advisory fee and/or reimburse the Portfolio so that Total Portfolio Fees, excluding certain investment related expenses, taxes, interest and other extraordinary expenses (including litigation), will not exceed 1.42%.��The fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements will continue for at least one year or until such time as the Fund's Board of Directors acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements when it deems such action is appropriate.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

�
ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUES
Since there were no sales of the Policy before the effective date
of this prospectus, there is no Accumulation Unit value history to report for each of the Separate Account variable investment
options offered by this prospectus. When such information becomes available, we will include it in future updates to this prospectus
in Appendix A.
�
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial statements of the Subaccounts of the Separate Account and
our company are included in the Statement of Additional Information. To learn how to get a copy, see the front or back page of
this prospectus.
�


CHARGES EXPLAINED

�
The following adds to information provided in the CHARGES
section. Please review both prospectus sections for information on charges. The Policy has no sales load and no withdrawal
charges.
�
MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE
We impose a daily fee to compensate us for the mortality and expense
risks we have under the Policy. This fee is reflected in the Accumulation Unit values for each Subaccount.
�
Our mortality risk arises from our obligation to make annuity
payments and to pay death benefits prior to the Annuity Date. The mortality risk we assume is that Annuitants will live longer
than we project, so our cost in making annuity payments will be higher than projected. However, an Annuitant's own longevity, or
improvement in general life expectancy, will not affect the periodic annuity payments we pay under your Policy. Another mortality
risk we assume is that at your death the death benefit we pay will be greater than the Policy value.
�
Our expense risk is that our costs to administer your Policy
will exceed the amount we collect through administrative charges.
�
If the mortality and expense risk charge does not cover our costs,
we bear the loss, not you. If the charge exceeds our costs, the excess is our profit.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA9�
���
�
ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES
Annual Policy Fee
We reserve the right to charge an annual Policy fee. We reserve the
right to waive an annual Policy fee if, on a Policy Anniversary, the Policy value is at least a certain amount which we declare
annually. Any Policy fee is deducted from your Policy value on the last Business Day of each Policy Year and upon a complete surrender.
This fee is levied by canceling Accumulation Units and making a deduction from the Fixed Account. It is deducted from each Subaccount
and the Fixed Account in the same proportion that the value in each Subaccount and the Fixed Account bears to the total Policy
value.
�
TRANSFER FEE
The first 15 transfers per Policy Year from Subaccounts or the Fixed
Account are free. A transfer fee may be imposed for any transfer in excess of 15 per Policy Year. The transfer fee is deducted
pro rata from each Subaccount (and, if applicable, the Fixed Account) in which the Owner is invested.
�
TAX CHARGES
Some states and municipalities levy a tax on annuities, currently
ranging from 0% to 3.5% of your premiums. These tax rates, and the timing of the tax, vary and may change. Presently, we deduct
the charge for the tax in those states with a tax either (a) from premiums as they are received, or (b) upon applying proceeds
to an annuity income option.
�
No charges are currently made for taxes other than premium taxes.
We reserve the right to levy charges in the future for taxes or other costs resulting from taxes that we determine are properly
attributable to the Separate Account.
�
Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit
2 ("GLWB2") Charge
The guaranteed maximum and current annual charges
for the GLWB2 rider are listed in the CHARGES section of this prospectus. Each fee is stated as a percentage that is multiplied
by the Rider Charge Base (see the GLWB2 Rider section of this prospectus). The current charge will be deducted from the
Policy value on each Monthly Anniversary.
�
The charges for the Policy and for the rider will be deducted from
the GLWB Model you select. If you use a GLWB Model consisting of multiple investment options, charges will be deducted pro-rata
from the subaccounts in the model. If your GLWB Model is comprised of a single investment option, charges will be deducted from
that investment option.
�
The rider charge is subject to change upon Policy Anniversary or
upon reset as described in the Reset Feature section of the GLWB2 rider description. The rider charge will not exceed the guaranteed
maximum fee for the rider listed in the CHARGES section. The rider charge will not be deducted after the Policy value reduces
to zero, or if the rider is terminated.
�
Fees Charged by the Portfolios
Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio has investment advisory fees
and expenses. They are set forth in this prospectus' CHARGES section and described in more detail in each fund's prospectus.
A portfolio's fees and expenses are not deducted from your Policy value. Instead, they are reflected in the daily value of portfolio
shares which, in turn, will affect the daily Accumulation Unit value of the Subaccounts. These fees and expenses help to pay the
portfolio's investment advisory and operating expenses.
�
Waiver of Certain Charges
When the Policy is sold in a manner that results in savings of sales
or administrative expenses, we reserve the right to waive all or part of any fee we charge under the Policy (excluding fees charged
by the portfolios). Factors we consider include one or more of the following: size and type of group to whom the Policy is issued;
amount of expected premiums; relationship with us (employee of us or an affiliated company, receiving distributions or making transfers
from other policies we or one of our affiliates issue or transferring amounts held under qualified retirement plans we or one of
our affiliates sponsor); type and frequency of administrative and sales services provided; or level of annual maintenance fee.
Any fee waiver will not be discriminatory and will be done according to our rules in effect at the time the Policy is issued. We
reserve the right to change these rules. The right to waive any charges may be subject to state approval.
�


INVESTMENT OPTIONS	

�
The Policy allows you to choose from a wide array of investment options
- each chosen for its potential to meet specific investment objectives.
�
You may allocate your premiums among the Separate Account variable
investment options and the Fixed Account fixed interest rate option. Allocations must be in whole percentages and total 100%. The
allocation of any premium to the Fixed Account may not exceed 25% of that premium without our prior consent. If our prior consent
is not received, we reserve the right to reallocate any excess Fixed Account
�


Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA10�
���
allocation to the Money Market Subaccount.
The variable investment options, which invest in underlying portfolios, are listed and described below.
�


The value of your Policy will increase or decrease based on the investment performance of the variable investment options you choose.��Please consider carefully, and on a continuing basis, which investment options best suit your long-term investment objectives and risk tolerance.

�
Separate Account Variable Investment
Options
The Separate Account provides you with variable investment options
in the form of underlying portfolio investments. Each underlying portfolio is an open-end investment management company. When you
allocate investments to an underlying portfolio, those investments are placed in a Subaccount of the Separate Account corresponding
to that portfolio, and the Subaccount in turn invests in the portfolio. We may refer to your investment allocation as Accumulation
Units or as a variable investment option. The value of your Policy depends directly on the investment performance of the portfolios
that you select.
�



The underlying portfolios in the Separate
  Account are NOT publicly traded mutual funds, and are NOT the same as publicly traded mutual funds with very similar names.
  They are only available as separate account investment options in variable life insurance or variable annuity policies issued by
  insurance companies, or through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement plans.
�
Even if the investment options and policies
  of some underlying portfolios available under the Policy may be very similar to the investment objectives and policies of publicly
  traded mutual funds that may be managed by the same investment adviser, the investment performance and results of the portfolios
  available under the Policy may vary significantly from the investment results of such other publicly traded mutual funds.
�
You should read the prospectuses for
  the underlying portfolios together with this prospectus for more information.

�
The Separate Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment
trust. However, the SEC does not supervise the management or the investment practices or policies of the Separate Account or Ameritas
Life. The Separate Account was established as a separate investment account of Ameritas Life under Nebraska law on October 26,
1995. Under Nebraska law, we own the Separate Account assets, but they are held separately from our other assets and are not charged
with any liability or credited with any gain on business unrelated to the Separate Account. Any and all distributions made by the
underlying portfolios, with respect to the shares held by the Separate Account, will be reinvested in additional shares at net
asset value. We are responsible to you for meeting the obligations of the Policy, but we do not guarantee the investment performance
of any of the variable investment options' underlying portfolios. We do not make any representations about their future performance.
�
You bear the risk that the variable investment
options you select may fail to meet their objectives,
that they could go down in value, and that
you could lose principal.
�
Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio operates as a separate investment
fund, and the income or losses of one generally have no effect on the investment performance of any other. Complete descriptions
of each variable investment option's investment objectives and restrictions and other material information related to an investment
in the variable investment option are contained in the prospectuses for each of the underlying portfolios which accompany this
prospectus.
�
The Separate Account Subaccount underlying portfolios listed below
are designed primarily as investments for variable annuity and variable life insurance policies issued
by insurance companies. They are not publicly traded mutual funds available for direct purchase by you. There is no
assurance the investment objectives will be met.
�
This information is just a summary for each underlying
portfolio. You should read the series fund prospectus for an underlying portfolio accompanying this prospectus for more information
about that portfolio, including detailed information about the portfolio�s fees and expenses, investment strategy and investment
objective, restrictions, and potential risks. To get a copy of any portfolio prospectus, contact your representative or us as shown
on the Table of Contents page or the last page of this prospectus.

Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options
We do not control the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios, so we cannot
guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available.
�
We retain the right to change the investments of the Separate Account,
and to eliminate the shares of any Subaccount's underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another series fund portfolio, if
the shares of the underlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if, in our judgment, investment in the portfolio
would be inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Separate Account. We may add new Separate Account underlying portfolios,
or eliminate existing underlying portfolios, when, in our sole discretion, conditions warrant a change. In all of these situations,
we will receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making any such change.
�
Our Separate Account may be (i) operated as an investment management
company or any other form permitted by law, (ii) deregistered with the SEC if registration is no longer required, or (iii) combined
with one or more other separate accounts. To the extent permitted by law, we also may transfer assets of the Separate Account to
other accounts. Where
permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to remove, combine or add Subaccounts. Subaccounts may be closed to new
or subsequent premium payments, transfers or premium allocations. We will receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making
any such change.
�
We will notify you of any changes to the variable investment options.
�
Resolving Material Conflicts � Underlying Investment
Interests
In addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the Subaccounts,
the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable
life insurance contracts. We do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio
shares to fund other products. However, there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between Policy Owners
and the owners of variable contracts issued by other

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA14�
���
�
companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios. Shares
of some of the portfolios also may be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section 401 of the
Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of Owners or
owners of other contracts (including contracts issued by other companies), and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement
plans. In the event of a material conflict, we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter, including removing that portfolio
as an underlying investment option of the Separate Account. The Board of Directors of each fund company will monitor events in
order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to those
events or conflicts. See the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information. (Also see the Transfers section,
Omnibus Orders.)

Fixed Account Investment Option
There is one fixed interest rate option ("Fixed
Account"), where we bear the investment risk. We guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest rate that will yield at least
1% per year, compounded annually. We may declare a higher current interest rate. However, you bear the risk that we will not credit
more interest than will yield the minimum guaranteed rate per year for the life of the Policy. We have sole discretion over how
assets allocated to the Fixed Account are invested, and we bear the risk that those assets will perform better or worse than the
amount of interest we have declared. Assets in the Fixed Account are subject to claims by creditors of the company. The focus of
this prospectus is to disclose the Separate Account aspects of the Policy.
�


All amounts allocated to the Fixed Account become assets of our general account.��Interest in the general account has not been registered with the SEC and is not subject to SEC regulation, nor is the general account registered as an investment company with the SEC.��Therefore, SEC staff have not reviewed the Fixed Account disclosures in this prospectus.

�
Transfers
Prior to the Annuity Date, you may transfer Policy value from one
Subaccount to another, from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account, or from the Fixed Account to any Subaccount, subject to
these rules:
�
Transfer Rules:

�A transfer is considered any single request to move assets from one or more Subaccounts or the Fixed Account to one or more
of the other Subaccounts or the Fixed Account.

�We must receive notice of the transfer by either Written Notice, an authorized telephone transaction, or by Internet when available.
Transfer requests by facsimile, telephone, or Internet must be sent to us by 3:00 p.m. Central Time (2:30 p.m. for Rydex) for same
day processing. Requests received later are processed on the next trading day. Fax requests must be sent to our trade desk at 402-467-7923.
If requests are faxed elsewhere, we will process them as of the day they are received by our trading unit.

�The transferred amount must be at least $250, or the entire Subaccount or Fixed Account value if it is less. (If the value
remaining after a transfer will be less than $250 in a Subaccount or $100 in the Fixed Account, we will include that amount as
part of the transfer.)

�If the Dollar Cost Averaging systematic transfer program is used, then the minimum transfer amount out of a Subaccount or the
Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program, the maximum amount that
may be transferred from the Fixed Account each month is 1/36th of the value of the Fixed Account at the time the Dollar
Cost Averaging program is established. While a Dollar Cost Averaging program is in effect, elective transfers out of the Fixed
Account are prohibited.

�The Portfolio Rebalancing and Earnings Sweep systematic transfer programs have no minimum transfer limits.

�The first 15 transfers each Policy Year are free. Thereafter, transfers may result in a $10 charge for each transfer. This
fee is deducted on a pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account; it is not subtracted from the amount
of the transfer. Transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the 15 free transfer limit.

�A transfer from the Fixed Account (except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program):

�may be made only once each Policy Year;

�may be delayed up to six months;

�is limited during any Policy Year to the greatest of:

�25% of the Fixed Account value on the date of the initial transfer during that year;

�the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the Fixed Account during the previous 13 months; or

�$1,000.

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA15�
���
�

�The amount transferred into the Fixed Account in any Policy Year (except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program) may
not exceed 10% of the Policy value of all Subaccounts as of the most recent Policy Anniversary, unless the remaining value in any
single Subaccount would be less than $1,000 in which case you may elect to transfer the entire value in that Subaccount to the
Fixed Account. Prior to the first Policy anniversary, the most recent Policy anniversary is the date the first transfer is made
into the Fixed Account.

�If the Policy value in any Subaccount falls below $100, we may transfer the remaining balance, without charge, proportionately
to the remaining investment options you selected in your latest allocation instructions. We will notify
you when such a transfer occurs. You may, within 60 days of the date of our notice, reallocate the amount transferred, without
charge, to another investment option.

�Rydex Subaccount transfers received later than 2:30 p.m. Central Time are processed the next Business Day.

�We reserve the right to limit transfers, or to modify transfer privileges, and we reserve the right to change the transfer
rules at any time, subject to Policy restrictions.

�In the event you authorize telephone or Internet transfers, we are not liable for telephone or Internet instructions that we
in good faith believe you authorized. We will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine.
�
Omnibus Orders
Purchase and
redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are "omnibus" orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans
and separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders
from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products. The omnibus nature of these
orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures. We cannot
guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies
that may invest in the portfolios. These other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding
frequent transfer activity. If their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity, it will
affect other owners of portfolio shares, as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts, including
ours, whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios. In addition, if a portfolio believes that an omnibus
order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from Owners engaged in disruptive trading, the portfolio may reject
the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request.
�
Third-Party Services
Where permitted and subject to our rules, we may accept your authorization
to have a third party exercise transfers or investment allocations on your behalf. Third-party transfers and allocations are
subject to the same rules as all other transfers and allocations. You can make this election by sending us Written Notice.
Please note that any person or entity you authorize to make transfers or allocations on your behalf, including any investment advisory,
asset allocation, money management or timing service, does so independently from any agency relationship they may have with us
for the sale of the Policies. They are accountable to you alone for such transfers or allocations. We are not responsible
for such transfers or allocations on your behalf, or recommendations to you, by such third-party services. You should be aware
that fees charged by such third parties for their service are separate from and in addition to fees paid under the Policy.
�
Disruptive Trading Procedures
The Policy is not designed to
serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to short-term fluctuations in the market (except in Subaccounts whose underlying
portfolio prospectus specifically permits such trading). Such frequent trading, programmed transfers, or transfers that are large
in relation to the total assets of a Subaccount�s underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a Subaccount�s underlying
portfolio and raise expenses. This in turn can hurt performance of an affected Subaccount and therefore hurt your Policy�s
performance.

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA16�
���
�
�


Organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the Policy, unless such transfers are limited to Subaccounts whose underlying portfolio prospectuses specifically permit such transfers.

�
Policy Owners should be aware
that we are contractually obligated to provide Policy Owner transaction data relating to trading activities to the underlying funds
on written request and, on receipt of written instructions from a fund, to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers
by Policy Owners identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions that violate the trading policies of the fund.
�
We reserve the right to reject or restrict, in our sole discretion,
transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions. We further
reserve the right to impose restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially
hurt the rights or interests of other Policy Owners. Restrictions may include changing, suspending, or terminating telephone, on-line,
and facsimile transfer privileges. We will also enforce any Subaccount underlying portfolio manager�s own restrictions imposed
upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive. Our disruptive trading procedures may vary from Subaccount to Subaccount,
and may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contract provisions. Any Subaccount restrictions will be uniformly
applied.
�
There is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective
in preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity. Our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently
apply our disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations. The discretionary
nature of our disruptive trading procedures may result in some Policy Owners being able to market time, while other Policy Owners
bear the harm associated with timing. Also, because other insurance companies and retirement plans may invest in Subaccount underlying
portfolios, we cannot guarantee that Subaccount underlying portfolios will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within contracts
issued by them. Certain Subaccount underlying portfolios, such as the Rydex Subaccounts, may permit short-term trading and will
have disclosed this practice in their portfolios� prospectuses.
�
Excessive Transfers
We reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are
engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we will consider, among other
things:

�the total dollar amount being transferred;

�the number of transfers you make over a period of time;

�whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within certain
Subaccount underlying portfolios;

�whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of individual Policy Owners in the
group; and

�the investment objectives and/or size of the Subaccount underlying portfolio.
�
Third Party Traders
We reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other
third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple Policy Owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging
in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners. In making this determination, we may, among other things:

�reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Policy Owner, or

�reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual Policy Owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted
by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one Policy Owner.
�
We will notify
affected Policy Owners before we limit transfers, modify transfer procedures or refuse to complete a transfer. Transfers made pursuant
to participation in a dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing or earnings sweep program are not subject to these disruptive
trading procedures. See the sections of the Prospectus describing those programs for the rules of each program.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA17�
���
�
Systematic Transfer Programs
We offer several systematic transfer programs.
We reserve the right to alter or terminate these programs upon thirty days written notice to you.
�
Dollar Cost Averaging
The Dollar Cost Averaging program allows you to automatically transfer,
on a periodic basis, a set dollar amount or percentage from the Vanguard VIF Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account to any
other Subaccount(s) or the Fixed Account. Requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount. You can begin Dollar Cost Averaging
when you purchase the Policy or later. You can increase or decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program
at any time. Dollar Cost Averaging is intended to limit loss by resulting in the purchase of more Accumulation Units when a portfolio�s
value is low, and fewer units when its value is high. However, there is no guarantee that such a program will result in a higher
Policy value, protect against a loss, or otherwise achieve your investment goals.
�
Dollar Cost Averaging Program Rules:

�There is no additional charge for the Dollar Cost Averaging program.

�We must receive notice of your election and any changed instruction - either by Written Notice or by telephone transaction
instruction.

�Automatic transfers can only occur monthly.

�The minimum transfer amount out of the Vanguard VIF Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the
balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program, the maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed Account
each month is 1/36th of the Fixed Account value at the time Dollar Cost Averaging is established. While a Dollar Cost
Averaging program is in effect, elective transfers out of the Fixed Account are prohibited. There is no maximum transfer amount
limitation applicable to any of the Subaccounts.

�You may specify that transfers be made on the 1st through the 28th day of the month. Transfers will be
made on the date you specify (or if that is not a Business Day, then on the next Business Day). If you do not select a date, the
program will begin on the next Policy Month date.

�You can limit the number of transfers to be made, in which case the program will end when that number has been made. Otherwise,
the program will terminate when the amount remaining in the Vanguard VIF Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account is less than
$100.

�Dollar Cost Averaging is not available when the Portfolio Rebalancing program is elected.
�
Portfolio Rebalancing
The Portfolio Rebalancing program allows you to rebalance your Policy
value among designated Subaccounts only as you instruct. You may change your rebalancing allocation instructions at any time. Any
change will be effective when the next rebalancing occurs.
�
Portfolio Rebalancing Program Rules:

�There is no additional charge for the Portfolio Rebalancing program.

�The Fixed Account is excluded from this program.

�You must request the rebalancing program, give us your rebalancing instructions, or request to end this program either by Written
Notice or by telephone transaction instruction.

�You may have rebalancing occur quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
�
Earnings Sweep
The Earnings Sweep program allows you to sweep earnings from your
Subaccounts to be rebalanced among designated investment options (Subaccounts or the Fixed Account), either based on your original
Policy allocation of premiums or pursuant to new allocation instructions. You may change your Earnings Sweep program instructions
at any time. Any change will be effective when the next sweep occurs.
�
Earnings Sweep Program Rules:

�There is no additional charge for the Earnings Sweep program.

�The Fixed Account is included in this program.

�You must request the Earnings Sweep program, give us your allocation instructions, or request to end this program either by
Written Notice or by telephone transaction instruction.

�You may have your earnings sweep quarterly, semi-annually or annually.

GLWB Models
We may offer GLWB Models. The
GLWB Models we currently offer are comprised of volatility managed funds. The GLWB Models are required if your Policy is issued
with the GLWB2 rider or if you add the GLWB2 rider after issue of your Policy. They are the only permitted GLWB Models for such
Policies.
�
Each of the three GLWB Models is comprised of a single investment
option that is managed by our affiliate, Calvert Investment Management, Inc. ("CIM"), subject to the oversight of CIM
and the fund's Board of Directors. (See Potential Conflicts of Interest, below.) The strategies used by the GLWB Models
limit the volatility risks associated with offering living benefit riders. In providing the GLWB Models, we are not providing investment
advice or managing the allocations under your Policy. There is no investment advisory agreement between you and any of our affiliates
to act as an adviser to you as the Policy Owner.
�
GLWB Models available for use with the GLWB2 rider are:

�VM Growth Model � The VM Growth Model is for long-term investors who seek growth potential with less emphasis on current
income. The Model is likely to experience fluctuation in value, while seeking to manage overall volatility. Losses are still possible.

�VM Moderate Growth Model � The VM Moderate Growth Model is for long-term investors who seek a balance of current income
and growth potential. The Model is likely to experience some fluctuations, while seeking to manage overall volatility. Losses are
still possible.

�VM Moderate Model � The VM Moderate Model is for investors who seek current income and stability, with modest potential
for increase in the value of their investment. Losses are still possible.
�
To elect a GLWB Model:

�You must allocate all of your Policy value to one GLWB Model.

�You are responsible for determining which model is best for you. Your financial adviser can help you make this determination
and may provide you with an investor questionnaire to help you define your investing style. There is no guarantee that the model
you select is appropriate to your ability to withstand investment risk. We are not responsible for your selection of a specific
investment option or model, or your decision to change to a different investment option.

�Performance of each GLWB Model is updated monthly on our website and is available upon request. If you wish to keep using your
selected model, you will not need to take any action, as your Policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically updated.
If you wish to change your selected model, you can select a different GLWB Model.

�You may not make changes to your allocations outside the GLWB Models. Changes to allocations outside the GLWB Model will be
considered as having withdrawn from the model and risk termination of your GLWB2 rider. For this reason, you will not be able to
execute trades online when you are using a GLWB Model. You will be required to communicate with the Service Center if you wish
to make a transfer or trade away from a GLWB Model. The Service Center will communicate that your election to execute a trade will
result in the discontinuance of the GLWB Model for your policy, prior to you being able to execute any telephone transaction.

�Additional safeguards apply if your Policy has the GLWB2 rider (See the GLWB2 Rider section, Asset Allocation).

�If participation in the GLWB Models terminates, including by death of the Owner, Policy value will reflect allocations to the
model last selected before termination. Any additional premiums received after the death of the Owner will be returned.
�
The strategies used by the GLWB Models seek to
limit the volatility risks associated with the value of your Policy. While these strategies are intended to reduce the risk of
market losses from investing in equity securities, they may result in periods of underperformance, especially, but not limited
to, during times when the market is appreciating. As a result, your Policy value may rise less than it would have without these
strategies. During periods of high market volatility, the strategies are intended to dampen the impact on your Policy value during
sharp market losses, but nevertheless, you may still incur losses.
�
Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to GLWB Models
In providing investment advisory services for the investments that
comprise the GLWB Models, CIM, together with its affiliates, including us, is subject to competing interests that may influence
its decisions. These competing interests typically arise because CIM or one of its affiliates serves as the investment adviser
or sub-adviser to the underlying funds and may provide other services in connection with such underlying funds, and because the
compensation we and our affiliates receive for providing these investment advisory and other services varies depending on the underlying
fund. For additional information about the conflicts of interest to which CIM and its affiliates are subject, see the fund prospectuses
for the funds underlying each of the GLWB Models.
�
Although GLWB Models are intended to mitigate investment
risk, there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still lose value. For information about risks related to, and more
detail about the investment options that comprise the GLWB Models, including more information about conflicts of interest, see
the prospectuses for the underlying investment options or ask for a copy of this prospectus� Statement of


Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA19�
���
Additional Information. We may modify the available
investment options, including selection of GLWB Models, at any time. We also may discontinue use of the GLWB Models at any time
(see the GLWB2 Rider, Asset Allocation section for additional information on discontinuation of a GLWB Model).
�
The GLWB2 rider will terminate if you withdraw
from a designated model or allocate any portion of your subsequent premium payments to an investment option that is not consistent
with the listed models.
�


IMPORTANT POLICY PROVISIONS

�
Many key rights and benefits under the Policy are summarized in this
prospectus; however, you must refer to the Policy itself for the actual terms of the Policy. You may obtain a copy of the Policy
from us. The Policy remains in force until surrendered for its Cash Surrender Value, or until all proceeds have been paid under
an annuity income option or as a death benefit.
�
Policy Application and Issuance
To purchase a Policy, you must submit an application and a minimum
initial premium. A Policy usually will be issued only if you and the Annuitant are age 0 through 85, rounded to the nearest birthday.
We reserve the right to reject any application or premium for regulatory reasons, or if the application or premium does not
meet the requirements stated in the Policy, as disclosed in this prospectus.
�



Replacing an existing annuity policy is
  not always your best choice.
Evaluate any replacement carefully.

�
If your application is in good order upon receipt, we will credit
your initial premium (less premium tax, if applicable) to the Policy value in accordance with your allocation instructions within
two Business Days after the later of the date we receive your application or the date we receive your premium. If the application
is incomplete or otherwise not in good order, we will contact you within five Business Days to explain the delay; at that time
we will refund your initial premium unless you consent to our retaining it to apply it to your Policy once all Policy issuance
requirements are met.
�
The Policy Date is the date two Business Days after we receive your
application and initial premium. It is the date used to determine Policy Anniversaries and Policy Years. No Policy will be dated
on or after the 29th day of a month. (This does not affect how premium is credited; see the paragraph above.)
�
Application in Good Order
All application questions must be answered, but particularly note
these requirements:

�The Owner's and the Annuitant's full name, Social Security number, and date of birth must be included.

�Your premium allocations must be completed in whole percentages, and total 100%.

�Initial premium must meet minimum premium requirements.

�Your signature must be on the application.

�Identify the type of plan, whether it is non-qualified or, if it is qualified, state the type of qualified plan.

�City, state and date application was signed must be completed.

�If you have one, please give us your e-mail address to facilitate receiving updated Policy information by electronic delivery.

�There may be forms in addition to the application required by law or regulation, especially when a qualified plan or replacement
is involved.
�
Premium Requirements
Your premium checks should be made payable to "Ameritas Life
Insurance Corp." We may postpone crediting any payment made by check to your Policy value until the check has been honored
by your bank. Payment by certified check, banker's draft, or cashier's check will be promptly applied. Under our electronic fund
transfer program, you may select a monthly payment schedule for us to automatically deduct premiums from your bank account or other
sources. Total premiums for all annuities held with us for the same Annuitant or Owner may not exceed $1 million without our consent.
�
Initial Premium

�The only premium required. All others are optional.

�Must be at least $2,000. We have the right to change these premium requirements, and to accept a smaller initial premium
if payments are established as part of a regularly billed program (electronic funds transfer, payroll deduction, etc.) or as part
of a tax-qualified plan.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA20�
���
�
Additional Premiums

�Must be at least $250; $50 if payments are established as part of a regularly billed program (electronic funds transfer, payroll
deduction, etc.) or a tax-qualified plan. We have the right to change these premium requirements.

�Will not be accepted, without our approval, on or after the earlier of (i) the Policy Anniversary nearest your 85th
birthday or (ii) the Annuity Date.
�
Allocating Your Premiums
You may allocate your premiums among the variable investment options
and the Fixed Account fixed interest rate option. Initial allocations in your Policy application will be used for additional premiums
until you change your allocation.

�Allocations must be in whole percentages, and total 100%.

�You may change your allocation by sending us Written Notice or through an authorized telephone transaction. The change will
apply to premiums received on or after the date we receive your Written Notice or authorized telephone transaction.

�All premiums will be allocated pursuant to your instructions on record with us.

�The allocation of any premium to the Fixed Account may not exceed 25% without our prior consent. If our prior consent is not
received, we reserve the right to reallocate any excess Fixed Account allocation proportionately to the remaining investment options
you selected in your latest allocation instructions.
�
"Right to Examine" Period Allocations
If you are not satisfied with the Policy, you may void it by returning
it to us within 10 days of receipt, or longer where required by state law. You will then receive a full refund of your Policy value;
however, where required by certain states, or if your Policy was issued as an Individual Retirement Account ("IRA"),
you will receive either the premium paid or your Policy value, whichever amount is greater.
�
Your Policy Value
On your Policy's
date of issue, the Policy value equals the initial premium less any charge for applicable premium taxes. On any Business Day thereafter,
the Policy value equals the sum of the values in the Separate Account variable investment options and the Fixed Account. The Policy
value is expected to change from day to day, reflecting the expenses and investment experience of the selected variable investment
options (and interest earned in the Fixed Account option) as well as the deductions for charges under the Policy.
�
Separate Account Value
Premiums or transfers allocated to Subaccounts
are accounted for in Accumulation Units. The Policy value held in the Separate Account Subaccounts on any Business Day is determined
by multiplying each Subaccount's Accumulation Unit value by the number of Subaccount units allocated
to the Policy. Each Subaccount's Accumulation Unit value is calculated at the end of each Business
Day as follows:

(a)the per share net asset value of the Subaccount's underlying portfolio as of the end of the current
Business Day plus any dividend or capital gain distribution declared and unpaid by the underlying portfolio during that Business
Day, times the number of shares held by the Subaccount, before the purchase or redemption of any shares on that date; minus

(b)the daily mortality and expense risk charge; and this result divided by

(c)the total number of Accumulation Units held in the Subaccount on the Business Day before the purchase or redemption of any
Accumulation Units on that day.
�
When transactions are made to or from a Subaccount, the actual dollar
amounts are converted to Accumulation Units. The number of Accumulation Units for a transaction is equal to the dollar amount of
the transaction divided by the Accumulation Unit value on the Business Day the transaction is made.
�
An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed
by the U.S. Government. There can be no assurance that the funds will be able to maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per
share.
�
Fixed Account Value
The Policy value of the Fixed Account on any Business Day equals:

(a)the Policy value of the Fixed Account at the end of the preceding Policy Month; plus

(b)any premiums credited since the end of the previous Policy Month; plus

(c)any transfers from the Subaccounts credited to the Fixed Account since the end of the previous Policy Month; minus

(d)any transfer and transfer fee from the Fixed Account to the Subaccounts since the end of the previous Policy Month; minus

(e)any partial withdrawal taken from the Fixed Account since the end of the previous Policy Month; minus

(f)the Fixed Account's share of the annual Policy fee on the Policy Anniversary; plus

(g)interest credited on the Fixed Account balance.

Telephone Transactions
Telephone Transactions Permitted:

�Transfers among investment options.

�Establish systematic transfer programs.

�Change of premium allocations.
�
How to Authorize Telephone Transactions

�Upon your authorization on the Policy application or in Written Notice to us, you or a third person named by you may do telephone
transactions on your behalf. You bear the risk of the accuracy of any designated person's instructions to us.
�
Telephone Transaction Rules:

�Must be received by close of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (usually 3:00 p.m. Central Time), except Rydex
Subaccount transactions must be received by 2:30 p.m. Central Time; if later, the transaction will be processed the next day the
NYSE is open.

�Calls will be recorded for your protection.

�For security, you or your authorized designee must provide your Social Security number and/or other identification information.

�May be discontinued at any time as to some or all Owners.
�
We are not liable for following telephone transaction
instructions we reasonably believe to be genuine.
�
DEATH OF ANNUITANT
Upon the Annuitant�s death prior to 30 days before the Annuity
Date, you may generally name a new Annuitant. If any Owner is the Annuitant, then upon that Owner�s death, the Policy�s
applicable death benefit becomes payable to the named beneficiary(ies). However, if the beneficiary is the deceased Owner�s
spouse, then upon that Owner�s death the spouse may be permitted under federal tax law to become the new Owner of the Policy
and to name an Annuitant and different beneficiaries.
�
Delay of Payments
We will usually pay any amounts requested as a full surrender or
partial withdrawal from the Separate Account within 7 days after we receive your Written Notice. We can postpone such payments
or any transfers out of a Subaccount if: (i) the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekend and holiday closings; (ii) trading
on the NYSE is restricted; (iii) an emergency exists as determined by the SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonably practical
to dispose of securities, or not reasonably practical to determine the value of the net assets of the Separate Account; or (iv)
the SEC permits delay for the protection of security holders. The applicable rules of the SEC will govern as to whether the conditions
in (iii) or (iv) exist.
�
We may defer payments of full surrenders or partial withdrawals or
a transfer from the Fixed Account for up to 6 months from the date we receive your Written Notice, after we request and receive
approval from the insurance commissioner of the state where the Policy is delivered.
�
Beneficiary
You may change your beneficiary by sending Written Notice to us,
unless the named beneficiary is irrevocable. Once we record and acknowledge the change, it is effective as of the date you signed
the Written Notice. The change will not apply to any payments made or other action taken by us before recording. If the named beneficiary
is irrevocable you may change the named beneficiary only by Written Notice signed by both you and the beneficiary. If more than
one named beneficiary is designated, and you fail to specify their interest, they will share equally.
�
If there are joint Owners, the surviving joint Owner will be deemed
the beneficiary, and the beneficiary named in the Policy application or subsequently changed will be deemed the contingent beneficiary.
If both joint Owners die simultaneously, the death benefit will be paid to the contingent beneficiary.
�
If the beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the
spouse may elect either to receive the death benefit, in which case the Policy will terminate, or to continue the Policy in force
with the spouse as Owner. The surviving spouse may not elect the Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit 2 rider when the single
life option was selected and the Policy was issued under an Internal Revenue Code Section 401 or 457 qualified plan.
�
If the named beneficiary dies before you, then
your estate is the beneficiary until you name a new beneficiary.
�
Minor Owner or Beneficiary
A minor may not own the Policy solely in the minor's name and cannot
receive payments directly as a Policy beneficiary. In most states parental status does not automatically give parents the
power to provide an adequate release to us to make beneficiary payments to the parent for the minor's benefit. A minor can "own"
a Policy through the trustee of a trust established for the minor's benefit, or through the minor's named and court appointed guardian,
who owns the Policy in his or her capacity as trustee or
�


Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA22�
���
guardian. Where a minor is a named beneficiary, we are able to pay
the minor's beneficiary payments to the minor's trustee or guardian. Some states allow us to make such payments up to a limited
amount directly to parents. Parents seeking to have a minor's interest made payable to them for the minor's benefit are encouraged
to check with their local court to determine the process to be appointed as the minor's guardian; it is often a very simple process
that can be accomplished without the assistance of an attorney. If there is no adult representative able to give us an adequate
release for payment of the minor's beneficiary interest, we will retain the minor's interest on deposit until the minor attains
the age of majority.
�
Policy Changes
Any change to your Policy is only effective if on a form acceptable
to us, and then only once it is received at our Service Office and recorded on our records. Information on how to contact us to
determine what information is needed and where you can get various forms for Policy changes is shown on this prospectus' first
two pages and last page.
�
Policy Termination
We may treat any partial withdrawal that leaves a Cash Surrender
Value of less than $1,000 as a complete surrender of the Policy. See this prospectus' POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS: Withdrawals
section for more information.
�
If you have paid no premiums during the previous 36-month period,
we have the right to pay you the total value of your Policy in a lump sum and cancel the Policy if (i) the Cash Surrender Value
is less than $1,000 (does not apply to IRAs), or (ii) the paid-up lifetime income annuity benefit at maturity, based on an accumulation
of the Policy value to maturity, would be less than $20 per month.
�


POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS

�
There are several ways to take all or part of your investment out
of your Policy, both before and after the Annuity Date. Tax penalties may apply to amounts taken out of your Policy before the
Annuity Date. Your Policy also provides a death benefit that may be paid upon your death prior to the Annuity Date. All or part
of a death benefit may be taxable.
�
Withdrawals
You may withdraw, by Written Notice, all or part of your Policy's
Cash Surrender Value prior to the Annuity Date. Following a full surrender of the Policy, or at any time the Policy value is zero,
all your rights in the Policy end. Total surrender requires you to return your Policy to us.
�



Withdrawals may be subject to:
���
  Income Tax
���
  Penalty Tax

�
Withdrawal Rules

�Withdrawals must be by Written Notice. A request for a systematic withdrawal plan must be on our form and must specify a date
for the first payment, which must be the 1st through 28th day of the month.

�Minimum withdrawal is $250.

�We may treat any partial withdrawal that leaves a Cash Surrender Value of less than $1,000 as a complete surrender of the Policy.

�Withdrawal results in cancellation of Accumulation Units from each applicable Subaccount and deduction of Policy value from
any Fixed Account option. If you do not specify which investment option(s) from which to take the withdrawal, it will be taken
from each investment option in the proportion that the Policy value in each investment option bears to the total Policy value.

�The amount paid to you upon total surrender of the Policy (taking any prior partial withdrawals into account) may be less than
the total premiums made, because we will deduct any charges owed but not yet paid, a premium tax charge may apply to withdrawals,
and because you bear the investment risk for all amounts you allocate to the Separate Account.

�Unless you give us Written Notice not to withhold taxes from a withdrawal, we must withhold 10% of the taxable amount withdrawn
to be paid as a federal tax, as well as any amounts required by state laws to be withheld for state income taxes.
�
Ameritas Life and the Separate Account may allow facsimile request
forms and signatures to be used for the purpose of a "Written Notice" authorizing withdrawals from your Policy. You may
complete and execute a withdrawal form and send it to our Service Center fax number, 402-467-7335. We may offer this method of
withdrawal as a service to meet your needs when turnaround time is critical. However, by not requiring an original signature there
is a greater possibility that unauthorized persons can manipulate your signature and make changes on your Policy (including withdrawals)
without your knowledge.

Systematic Withdrawal Plan
The systematic withdrawal plan allows you to automatically withdraw
payments of a pre-determined dollar amount or fixed percentage of Policy value from a specified investment option monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually. We can support and encourage your use of electronic fund transfer of systematic withdrawal plan payments
to an account of yours that you specify to us. The fixed dollar amount of systematic withdrawals may be calculated in support of
Internal Revenue Service minimum distribution requirements over the lifetime of the Annuitant. No systematic withdrawal may be
established after the 28th of each month. Although this plan mimics annuity payments, each distribution is a withdrawal
that may be taxable and subject to the charges and expenses described above; you may wish to consult a tax adviser before requesting
this plan.

Death Benefits
Death Benefit Upon Owner�s Death
We will pay the death benefit after we receive Due Proof of Death
of an Owner�s death and we have sufficient information about the beneficiary to make the payment. Death benefits may be paid
pursuant to an annuity income option to the extent allowed by applicable law and any settlement agreement in effect at your death.
If the beneficiary does not make an annuity income option election within 60 days of our receipt of Due Proof of Death, we will
issue a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary.
�



A death benefit is payable upon:
���
  Your Policy being in force;
���
  Receipt of Due Proof of Death of the first Owner to die;
���
  Election of an annuity income option; and
���
  Proof that the Owner died before any annuity payments begin.
�Due Proof of Death� is a certified copy
  of a death certificate, a certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the finding of death, a written
  statement by the attending physician, or any other proof satisfactory to us.

�
Until we receive satisfactory proof of death and instructions, in
the proper form, from your beneficiaries, your Policy will remain allocated to the Subaccounts you chose, so the amount of the
death benefit will reflect the investment performance of those Subaccounts during this period. If your Policy has multiple beneficiaries,
we will calculate and pay each beneficiary's share of the death benefit proceeds once we receive satisfactory proof of death and
when we receive instructions, in proper form, from that beneficiary. The death benefit proceeds still remaining to be paid to other
beneficiaries will continue to fluctuate with the investment performance of the Subaccounts you chose, until each beneficiary has
provided us instructions in the proper form.
�
If an Owner of the Policy, under Federal tax law, is a corporation,
trust, or other non-individual, we treat the primary Annuitant as an Owner for purposes of the death benefit. The "primary
Annuitant" is that individual whose life affects the timing or the amount of the death benefit payout under the Policy. A
change in the primary Annuitant will be treated as the death of an Owner, as Federal law requires, and the death benefit we will
pay is the lesser of the Policy value or the Cash Surrender Value. See the IRS Required Distribution Upon Death of Owner
section below.
�
If the Annuitant is an Owner or joint Owner, the Annuitant�s
death is treated as the Owner�s death.
�
If the Annuitant is not an Owner and the Annuitant dies before the
Annuity Date, the Owner may name a new Annuitant if such Owner(s) is not a corporation or other non-individual or if such Owner
is the trustee of an Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) retirement plan. If the Owner does not name a new Annuitant, the Owner
will become the Annuitant.
�
If your spouse is the Policy beneficiary, Annuitant, or a joint Owner,
special tax rules apply. See the IRS Required Distribution Upon Death of Owner section below.
�
We will deduct any applicable premium tax not previously deducted
from the death benefit payable.
�
In most cases, when death benefit proceeds are paid in a lump sum,
we will pay the death benefit proceeds by establishing an interest bearing account for the beneficiary, in the amount of the death
benefit proceeds payable. The same interest rate schedule and other account terms will apply to all
beneficiary accounts in place at any given time. We will send the beneficiary a checkbook within 7 days after we receive
all the required documents, and the beneficiary will have immediate access to the account simply by writing a check for all or
any part of the amount of the death benefit proceeds payable. The account is part of our general account. It is not a bank account
and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As part of our general account, it is subject to the claims of
our creditors. We receive a benefit from all amounts left in the general account.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA24�

�
Standard Death Benefit
Upon any Owner�s death before the Annuity Date, the Policy
will end, and we will pay a death benefit to your beneficiary. The death benefit equals the larger of:

�your Policy value on the later of the date we receive Due Proof of Death or an annuity payout option election less any charge
for applicable premium taxes; or

�adjusted guaranteed death benefit premiums.
�
We define adjusted guaranteed
death benefit premiums as total premiums paid into the Policy less an adjustment for each withdrawal. If you have not taken any
withdrawals from the Policy, the adjusted guaranteed death benefit premium is equal to the total premiums paid into the Policy.
To calculate the adjustment amount for the first withdrawal made under the Policy, we determine the percentage by which the withdrawal
reduces the Policy value. For example, a $10,000 withdrawal from a Policy with a $100,000 value is a 10% reduction in Policy value.
This percentage is calculated by dividing the amount of the withdrawal by the Policy value immediately prior to taking that withdrawal.
The resulting percentage is multiplied by the total premiums paid into the Policy immediately prior to the withdrawal and then
subtracted from the total premiums paid into the Policy immediately prior to the withdrawal. The resulting amount is the adjusted
guaranteed death benefit premiums.
�
To arrive at the adjusted guaranteed death benefit premiums for subsequent
withdrawals, we determine the percentage by which the Policy value is reduced by taking the amount of the withdrawal in relation
to the Policy value immediately prior to taking the withdrawal. We then multiply the adjusted guaranteed death benefit premiums
as determined immediately prior to the withdrawal by this percentage. We subtract that result from the adjusted guaranteed death
benefit premiums determined immediately prior to the withdrawal to arrive at the subsequent guaranteed death benefit premiums.
�
Upon any Owner�s death on or after the Annuity Date and before
all proceeds have been paid, no death benefit is payable, but any remaining proceeds will be paid to the designated annuity benefit
payee based on the annuity income option in effect at the time of death.
�
IRS Required Distribution Upon Death of Owner
Federal law requires that if your Policy is tax non-qualified and
you die before the Annuity Date, then the entire value of your Policy must be distributed within 5 years of your death. The 5-year
rule does not apply to that portion of the proceeds which (a) is for the benefit of an individual beneficiary; and (b) will be
paid over the lifetime or the life expectancy of that beneficiary as long as payments begin not later than one year after the date
of your death. Special rules may apply to your surviving spouse. A more detailed description of these rules and other required
distribution rules that apply to tax-qualified Policies are included in Appendix B of this prospectus.
�
Tables Illustrating Benefits Upon Death
The following tables illustrate
benefits payable, if any, upon death of a party to the Policy for most, but not necessarily all, situations. The terms of any Policy
rider or qualified plan funded by the Policy may change this information. Please consult your own legal and tax adviser for advice.

�
Annuity Income Benefits
A primary function of an annuity contract, like this Policy, is to
provide annuity payments to the payee(s) you name. You will receive the annuity benefits unless you designate another payee(s).
The level of annuity payments is determined by your Policy value, the Annuitant's sex (except where prohibited by law) and age,
and the annuity income option selected. All or part of your Policy Cash Surrender Value may be placed under one or more annuity
income options.
�


Annuity
  payments:
���
  require investments to be allocated to our general account,
  so are not variable.
���
  may be taxable and, if premature, subject to a tax penalty.

�
Annuity payments must be made to individuals receiving payments on
their own behalf, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Any annuity income option is effective only after we acknowledge it. We may
require initial and ongoing proof of the Owner's or Annuitant's age or survival. Unless you specify otherwise, the payee is the
Owner.
�
Payments under the annuity income options are fixed annuity payments
based on a fixed rate of interest at or higher than the minimum effective annual rate which is guaranteed to yield 1.5% on an annual
basis. We have sole discretion whether or not to pay a higher interest rate for all annuity income options. Current annuity income
option amounts for all options are used if higher than the guaranteed amounts (guaranteed amounts are based upon the tables contained
in the Policy). The guaranteed amounts for all annuity income options are based on the interest rate described above. Guaranteed
amounts for options 4 and 5 (see below) are also based on the A2000 Valuation Mortality Table, projected 20 years. Current interest
rates, and further information, may be obtained from us. The amount of each fixed annuity payment is set and begins on the Annuity
Date, and does not change.
�
When Annuity Income Payments Begin
You select the Annuity Date by completing an election form that you
can request from us at any time. This date may not be any earlier than the fifth Policy Anniversary. If you do not specify a date,
the Annuity Date will be the later of the Policy Anniversary nearest the Annuitant's 85th birthday or the fifth Policy
Anniversary. Tax-qualified Policies may require an earlier Annuity Date. You may change this date by sending Written Notice for
our receipt at least 30 days before the then current Annuity Date.
�
Selecting an Annuity Income Option
You choose the annuity income option by completing
an election form that you can request from us at any time. You may change your selection during your life by sending Written Notice
for our receipt at least 30 days before the date annuity payments are scheduled to begin. If no selection is made by then, we will
apply the Policy Cash Surrender Value to make annuity payments under annuity income option 4 providing lifetime income payments.
�


The
  longer the guaranteed or projected annuity income option period, 
the
  lower the amount of each annuity payment.

�
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA26�
���
�
If you die before the Annuity Date (and the Policy is in force),
your beneficiary may elect to receive the death benefit under one of the annuity income options (unless applicable law or a settlement
agreement dictate otherwise).
�
Annuity Income Options
Once fixed annuity payments under an annuity income option begin,
they cannot be changed. (We may allow the Annuitant or Beneficiary to transfer amounts applied under options 1, 2, or 3 to option
4, 5, or 6 after the Annuity Date. However, we reserve the right to discontinue this practice.) When the Owner dies, we will pay
any unpaid guaranteed payments to your beneficiary. Upon the last payee's death, we will pay any unpaid guaranteed payments to
that payee's estate.
�
Note: Unless you elect an annuity income option with a guaranteed
period or option 1, it is possible that only one annuity payment would be made under the annuity payout option if the Annuitant
dies before the due date of the second annuity payment, only two annuity payments would be made if the Annuitant died before the
due date of the third annuity payment, etc. This would not happen if you elect an annuity option guaranteeing either the amount
or duration of payments, or just paying interest (options 1, 2, or 3).
�
Part or all of any annuity payment may be taxable as ordinary income.
If, at the time annuity payments begin, you have not given us Written Notice not to withhold federal income taxes, we must by law
withhold such taxes from the taxable portion of each annuity payment and remit it to the Internal Revenue Service. (Withholding
is mandatory for certain tax-qualified Policies.)
�
We may pay your Policy proceeds to you in one sum if they are less
than $1,000, or when the annuity income option chosen would result in periodic payments of less than $20. If any annuity payment
would be or becomes less than $20, we also have the right to change the frequency of payments to an interval that will result in
payments of at least $20. In no event will we make payments under an annuity option less frequently than annually.
�
The annuity income options are:
�

1.Interest Payment. While proceeds remain on deposit, we annually credit interest to the proceeds. The interest
may be paid to the payee or added to the amount on deposit.

2.Designated Amount Annuity. Proceeds are paid in monthly installments of a specified amount over at least a 5-year
period until proceeds, with interest, have been fully paid.

3.Designated Period Annuity. Proceeds are paid in monthly installments for the specified period chosen. Monthly
incomes for each $1,000 of proceeds, which include interest, are illustrated by a table in the Policy.

4.Lifetime Income Annuity. Proceeds are paid as monthly income during the Annuitant's life. Variations provide
for guaranteed payments for a period of time.

5.Joint and Last Survivor Lifetime Income Annuity. Proceeds are paid as monthly income during the joint Annuitants'
lives and until the last of them dies.

6.Lump Sum. Proceeds are paid in one sum.

GLWB2 Rider
A Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit 2 ("GLWB2")
rider is part of your Policy if you elect it at the time of issue, or, under the circumstances described below, you add it after
issue, provided the rider is available and approved in your state. If you elect the GLWB2 rider at issue, the Policy Date is used
to calculate certain values and benefit phases. If you add the GLWB2 rider after issue, the "Rider Date" is used to calculate
certain values and benefit phases. The Rider Date is the date you add the GLWB2 rider. For convenience, in this section, "Rider
Date" is used to refer to both the Policy Date and the Rider Date.
�
The rider is only available if the Policy Owner
is age 49 years, six months and one day ("attained age 50") through age 85 years, 6 months ("attained age 85").
The rider will be in the Accumulation Phase at the Rider Date. If you elect to enter the Withdrawal Phase, the Withdrawal Phase
will begin no sooner than 30 days after the Rider Date.
�
If your Policy was purchased before your attained
age 50, you may add the GLWB2 rider on the Policy Anniversary nearest your fiftieth (50th) birthday. We will send you notice of
your ability to add the GLWB2 rider after issue at least sixty (60) days prior to the Policy Anniversary when it may be added.
The GLWB2 rider may not be added after the date provided in the notice. You must affirmatively respond to us in writing and we
must receive your response before the date provided in the notice.
�
The GLWB2 rider provides a withdrawal benefit that
guarantees a series of annualized withdrawals from the Policy, regardless of the Policy value, until the death of the last Covered
Person. Guarantees, which are obligations of the general account, are subject to the claims paying ability of the Company and do
not apply to the performance of the underlying investment options available with this product.

�
GLWB2 Definitions
Benefit phases are defined as:

�Accumulation Phase. The period of time between the Rider Date and the first date of the Withdrawal Phase. The rider
will remain in the Accumulation Phase for at least 30 days.

�Withdrawal Phase. The period of time beginning with the occurrence of the first withdrawal as outlined in the Withdrawal
Phase section, below.

�Guaranteed Phase. The period of time during which Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Amount payments continue to be made, although
the Policy value has been reduced to zero.
�
Benefit Base. The amount used in conjunction with a lifetime
distribution factor to determine the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Amount. Determined at the beginning of the Withdrawal Phase, the
initial benefit base equals the greatest of the following:

�Policy value

�Premium Accumulation Value

�Maximum Anniversary Policy Value
�
Covered Person(s).

�The Owner(s) of the Policy or;

�The Annuitant(s) if the Owner of the Policy is a non-natural person, such as a trust or;

�The spouses at the time the joint spousal option is selected. Once the joint spousal option is issued, no changes to the Covered
Persons will be permitted.
�
Excess Withdrawal. The portion of any withdrawal
taken during the Withdrawal Phase that makes the total of all withdrawals in a Policy Year exceed the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit
Amount in that Policy Year.
�
Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Amount ("LWBA").
The maximum amount that can be withdrawn under this rider during a Policy Year without reducing the Benefit Base.
�
Maximum Anniversary Policy Value. The highest
Policy value on any Policy Anniversary during the premium accumulation period (currently 10 years, however we may change the length
of this period for new issues and new rider elections within a range we have established) after the later of the Rider Date or
the most recent reset date, if any.
�
Premium Accumulation Value. The sum
of premiums paid plus interest at the premium accumulation rate compounded annually for the premium accumulation period. This
accumulation occurs during the Accumulation Phase beginning with the later of the Rider Date or the most recent reset date,
if any. The initial Premium Accumulation Value is equal to the initial premium or the Policy value as of the Rider Date if
you add the GLWB2 rider after issue. The rate of interest is:

�5% for the Policy Year in which no withdrawal is taken.

�0% for the Policy Year in which a withdrawal is taken.
We may change these rates for new issues and new
rider elections.
�
Remaining Balance. The most recently determined
Benefit Base minus the sum of all withdrawals made since the later of the beginning of the Withdrawal Phase or the most recent
step-up of the Benefit Base. The Remaining Balance will never be less than zero.
�
Rider Charge Base. The value used to
calculate the monthly rider charge for each Policy Month. If you elect the GLWB2 rider at issue, the Rider Charge Base is set
equal to the initial premium. If you add the GLWB2 rider after issue, the Rider Charge Base is set to equal the Policy value
as of the Rider Date. During the Accumulation Phase it is established on each Policy Anniversary as the maximum of the Policy
value, the Premium Accumulation Value, and the Maximum Anniversary Policy Value. However, during the Policy Year the Rider
Charge Base is increased dollar for dollar for premiums paid since the previous Policy Anniversary. The Rider Charge Base is
also reduced for any withdrawals taken since the previous Policy Anniversary in the proportion that the withdrawal amount has
to the Policy value prior to the withdrawal as described in the Withdrawals section of this rider.
�
During the Withdrawal Phase the Rider Charge Base
is equal to the Benefit Base.
�
Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). The Required Minimum
Distribution amount as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9), 408(b)(3), and related regulations. It is based on the
previous year-end Policy value of only the Policy to which this rider is attached, including the present value of additional benefits
provided under the Policy and any other riders attached to the Policy to the extent required to be taken into account under IRS
guidance. 
�
Rider Charges
The Guaranteed Maximum Charge and the Current Charge for the rider
are shown in the CHARGES section of this prospectus. Other information about the rider charges is discussed in the CHARGES
EXPLAINED section.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA28�
���
�
Asset Allocation
The GLWB2 rider limits individual transfers and
future premium allocations otherwise permitted by the Policy. You agree that your Policy value will be invested in one of certain
permitted allocation models ("GLWB Models") while the rider is active. You may not allocate to the Subaccounts or
the Fixed Account.
�
GLWB Models:
If your Policy is issued with a GLWB2 rider or
if you add a GLWB2 rider after issue of your Policy, you are required to participate in the GLWB Models when the GLWB2 rider is
issued or added. The GLWB Models are the only permitted GLWB Models for such Policies. The GLWB Models available for use are:

�VM Growth

�VM Moderate Growth

�VM Moderate
�
The conditions of the GLWB Models apply (see the GLWB Models
section). Only you can select the GLWB Model best for you. Changes to your allocations outside the permitted GLWB Models will terminate
the rider. You are permitted to transfer your total Policy value from one of the GLWB Models to another GLWB Model. You may maintain
Policy value in only one GLWB Model at any given time. A GLWB Model may be comprised of allocation to a single investment option
or among multiple investment options.
�
The following apply if a GLWB Model consists of multiple investment
options:

�The GLWB Models and any other investment restrictions are subject to periodic rebalancing.

�Premium payments will be credited to the model and withdrawals will be deducted from the model according to the GLWB Model
allocation.

�All premium payments will be credited pro rata among the investment options according to the allocation for the current GLWB
Model and all withdrawals will be deducted pro rata from the investment options according to the allocation for the current GLWB
Model.
�
We have the right to create new GLWB Models or
discontinue access to a GLWB Model. If a GLWB allocation model will be discontinued, we will notify you at least 30 days prior
to the change. If after 30 days you have not selected another GLWB Model, we will transfer all funds from the discontinued GLWB
Model to a default GLWB Model as specified in the notice. You may later request to transfer your total Policy value from the default
GLWB Model to any of the remaining permitted GLWB Models.
�
We may close one or more GLWB Models to additional
premium payments and transfers. We will notify you at least 30 days prior to the closure(s). If you wish to make additional premium
payments, you will be required to transfer your total Policy value to another permitted GLWB Model for which additional premium
payments are permitted.
�
We will notify you in the event any transaction you request will
involuntarily cause your GLWB2 rider to terminate for failure to invest according to a permitted GLWB Model. We will require you
to sign a form to terminate your GLWB2 rider and request the investment option change. Until the service form is received in good
order in our office, we will not complete your requested change.
�
Single Life Option
� Rider Election by Surviving Spouse
This section applies only to Policies issued
as tax non-qualified, or to Policies issued as Traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, or Roth IRAs. The rider is not available to a surviving
spouse when the single life option was selected and the Policy was issued under a qualified plan established by the applicable
provisions of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401 or 457.
�
If the Covered Person dies during the Accumulation
Phase of the rider and if the surviving spouse of the deceased Covered Person has attained the age of 50, the surviving spouse
may elect to continue this rider for his or her life in accordance with its terms. If the surviving spouse so elects, the rider
will continue in the Accumulation Phase and the Premium Accumulation Value and Maximum Anniversary Policy Value will be set equal
to the Policy Value. The rider charge will equal the rider charge in effect for new issues of the same rider and will not exceed
the Maximum Rider Charge for the GLWB2 rider, as stated in the CHARGES section of this prospectus. If the surviving spouse
has not reached attained age 50, the rider will terminate.
�
If the Covered Person dies during the Withdrawal
Phase, and if the surviving spouse of the deceased Covered Person elects to continue the Policy in accordance with its terms, the
surviving spouse may continue the Policy and the rider. The LWBA in effect on the date of the Covered Person�s death will
be paid until such time that the Remaining Balance is reduced to zero. No step-up of the Benefit Base is available after the Covered
Person�s death. 
�
Joint Spousal Option � for Non-Qualified and IRA Plans
The joint spousal option is available for Policies issued as tax
non-qualified or Traditional, SEP, SIMPLE, or Roth IRAs (together referred to as "IRAs"). Additional conditions for IRAs
with the joint spousal rider

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA29�

�
include that the spouse must be the primary beneficiary of the Owner.
You should consult a competent tax adviser to learn how tax laws may apply to your interests in the Policy.
�
Accumulation Phase
Reset Feature
On each Policy Anniversary during the Accumulation Phase, the Premium
Accumulation Value will be reset to the Policy value, if it is greater.
�
At the time of a reset:

1.A new premium accumulation period begins for the:

a.Premium Accumulation Value; and

b.Maximum Anniversary Policy Value.

2.If the rider charge increases, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to the Policy Anniversary. The charge for the rider
will be specified in the notice and will not exceed the maximum charge as stated in the CHARGES section of this prospectus.

3.You can decline the charge increase by sending us Written Notice no later than 10 days prior to the Policy Anniversary. If
you decline the charge increase, the reset feature will be suspended and the charge percentage will remain unchanged for the current
Policy Year. On each subsequent Policy Anniversary during the Accumulation Phase you will have the option to accept any available
reset.
�
On and after each reset, the provisions of the
rider will apply in the same manner as they applied when the rider was issued or added. The deduction of charges, limitations on
withdrawals, and any future reset options available on and after the most recent reset will again apply and will be measured from
the most recent reset.
�
Withdrawals
You are permitted one withdrawal per Policy Year during the Accumulation
Phase without initiating the Withdrawal Phase. (The withdrawal must be at least $250 and conform to other terms in the WITHDRAWALS
section of this prospectus.) You must indicate your wish to exercise this provision at the time you request the withdrawal. The
withdrawal can be no sooner than 30 days after the Rider Date. A second request for a withdrawal in a Policy Year will automatically
transition the rider to the Withdrawal Phase as described in the Withdrawal Phase section below.
�
A withdrawal will reduce the Rider Charge Base, Premium Accumulation
Value, and the Maximum Anniversary Policy Value in the same proportion that the withdrawal amount has to the Policy value prior
to the withdrawal. The Rider Charge Base, Premium Accumulation Value, and Maximum Anniversary Policy Value after the withdrawal,
respectively, will be equal to (a), minus the result of multiplying (a) by the quotient of (b) divided by (c) as shown in the following
formula:
�
a � (a * (b / c))
�
where:
a = Rider Charge Base, Premium Accumulation
Value, or Maximum Anniversary Policy Value prior to the withdrawal;
b = withdrawal amount;
c = Policy value prior to the withdrawal
�
Example:
Assume the following items (actual results will depend
on Policy experience):


Rider Charge Base (a)
= $105,000

Premium Accumulation (a)
= $100,000

Maximum Anniversary Policy Value (a)
= $115,000

Partial Withdrawal Amount (b)
= $��20,000

Policy Value before the withdrawal (c)
= $120,000

Given the assumed values, the effect of the partial withdrawal
on the Premium Accumulation Value would be:
a = $100,000
b = $ 20,000
c = $120,000
Premium Accumulation after the partial withdrawal
= $100,000 � ($100,000 * ($20,000/$120,000))
= $100,000 � ($100,000 * (0.16667))
= $100,000 � ($16,667)
= $83,333
�
The effect of the partial withdrawal on the Rider Charge Base and
Maximum Anniversary Policy Value assumed above would be $87,499.65 and $95,832.95, respectively, utilizing the same equation.
�
Taking a withdrawal under this provision will reduce the annual rate
of interest for the Premium Accumulation Value to 0% for the Policy Year in which the withdrawal is taken.

Withdrawal Phase
You may choose to begin withdrawal payments no sooner than 30 days
after the Rider Date and no later than 60 days after the date we receive the properly completed service form in our office.
�
Benefit Base
The Benefit Base is established at the beginning of the Withdrawal
Phase. It is not used to determine other benefits or features of the Policy or the rider.
�
The Benefit Base is adjusted downward due to an Excess Withdrawal
and upward due to step-up or additional premium payments.
�
Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Amount ("LWBA")
We guarantee, as an obligation of our general account, that you can
withdraw up to the LWBA during the Withdrawal Phase, regardless of Policy value, until the death of the last Covered Person.
�
The LWBA is determined by applying the lifetime distribution factor
to the Benefit Base. The lifetime distribution factor corresponds to the attained age of the Youngest Covered Person at
the beginning of the Withdrawal Phase. The lifetime distribution factor is established from the following schedule; it never changes
once it is established:

�3.50% - ages 50 through 54

�4.00% - ages 55 through 59

�4.50% - ages 60 through 64

�5.00% - ages 65 through 69

�5.25% - ages 70 through 74

�5.50% - ages 75 through 79

�6.00% - age 80 and older
�
However, we may change this schedule for new issues
and new rider elections. At any time that the Benefit Base is adjusted, the LWBA is redetermined by applying the lifetime distribution
factor determined at the beginning of the Withdrawal Phase to the adjusted Benefit Base.
�
You have the choice of receiving withdrawals on
an annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. If periodic withdrawals would be or become less than $100, we will change
the frequency of withdrawals to an interval that will result in a payment of at least $100.
�
Impact of Withdrawals on Benefit Base
Withdrawals taken during the Withdrawal Phase may
impact the Benefit Base. Total withdrawals in a Policy Year up to the LWBA will not reduce the Benefit Base and will not impact
the LWBA. If you are required to take RMD from the Policy and the RMD exceeds the LWBA, the portion of the RMD that is greater
than the LWBA will not be treated as an Excess Withdrawal. Any withdrawal amount that causes total withdrawals in a Policy Year
to exceed the greater of the LWBA or the RMD will be treated as an Excess Withdrawal.
�
At the time a withdrawal is taken, if the total withdrawals in a
Policy Year exceed the LWBA, the excess will be considered as an Excess Withdrawal. Excess Withdrawals will proportionally reduce
the Benefit Base. The proportional reduction that will be applied to the Benefit Base is equal to the quotient of (x) divided by
the result of subtracting (z) minus (x) from (y):
�


x

(y � (z � x))

�
where:
x = Excess Withdrawal amount with respect to LWBA;
y = Policy value immediately prior to the withdrawal;
z = total amount of the current withdrawal.
�
Example:
Assume the following items (actual results will depend on Policy
experience):


Benefit Base
= $100,000

LWBA
= $����5,000

Partial Withdrawal Amount (z)
= $����7,000

Excess Partial Withdrawal Amount (x)
= $����2,000

Policy Value Prior to Withdrawal (y)
= $��90,000

�
The proportional reduction factor: x/(y � (z-x))
= 2,000 / (90,000 � (7,000-2,000)) = 0.02353
The effect on the Benefit Base is: $100,000 x 0.02353
= $2,353
Applying the reduction to the Benefit Base: $100,000 -
$2,353 = $97,647
�
A reduction in the Benefit Base will reduce the LWBA.
�
No Excess Withdrawals will be allowed when the
Policy value is zero. If an Excess Withdrawal reduces the LWBA to an amount less than $100, we will pay the Remaining Balance in
a lump sum. The rider and its benefits will be terminated.


Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA31�
���
Step-Up of Benefit Base
On each Policy Anniversary during the Withdrawal
Phase, we will compare the Policy value to the Benefit Base. If the Policy value is greater than the Benefit Base on any anniversary,
we will increase the Benefit Base to equal the Policy value and recalculate the LWBA, which will increase the LWBA.
�
Additional Premiums
Additional premium payments made during the Withdrawal
Phase will:

1.increase the Policy value according to the provisions of the Policy; and,

2.increase the Benefit Base; and,

3.increase the LWBA.
�
Premium payments made during the Withdrawal Phase
may not exceed $25,000 during a Policy Year without our prior approval. Premium payments will not be accepted if the Policy value
is zero.
�
Guaranteed Phase
If a withdrawal (including an RMD) reduces the
Policy value to zero and at least one Covered Person is still living, the following will apply:

a.the monthly rider charge will no longer be deducted; and,

b.the LWBA will be provided until the death of the last surviving Covered Person under a series of pre-authorized
withdrawals according to a frequency selected by the Owner, but no less frequently than annually; and,

c.no additional premiums will be accepted; and,

d.no additional step-ups will occur; and,

e.any Remaining Balance will not be available for payment in a lump sum and may not be applied to provide
payments under an annuity option; and,

f.the Policy and any other riders will cease to provide any death benefits.
�
Death Benefit
Upon the death of the last Covered Person, provided
the rider is not in the Guaranteed Phase, the beneficiary will elect to receive either the Death Benefit as provided by the Policy,
or the distribution of the Remaining Balance accomplished through the payment of the LWBA subject to the IRS regulations as relating
to RMD until such time that the Remaining Balance is zero.
�
If the last surviving
Covered Person dies and the Policy value is zero as of the date of death, any Remaining Balance of the Benefit Base will
be distributed to the Beneficiary through the payment of the LWBA until such time that the Remaining Balance is zero.
�
Termination of Rider
Except as otherwise provided under the Single Life Option �
Rider Election by Surviving Spouse section, the rider will terminate without value on the earliest occurrence of any of the
following dates:

1.the date of death of the last surviving Covered Person;

2.the date there is a change of Owner that results in a change of Covered Person;

3.the date annuity payments commence under an annuity income option as described in the Policy;

4.the date an Excess Withdrawal is taken such that the LWBA is less than $100;

5.the date any asset allocation requirement or investment restriction is violated;

6.the date the Owner(s) provides us with Written Notice to terminate either the rider or the Policy.
If annuity payments are to commence under number 3 above at the maximum
Annuity Date, the Owner may select one of the following options:

a.apply the Policy value under an annuity income option described in the Policy, or

b.receive periodic annualized payments equal to the LWBA that would otherwise be determined at that time through a life contingent
annuity.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS

�
This discussion of how federal income tax laws may affect investment
in your variable annuity is based on our understanding of current laws as interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS").
It is not intended as tax advice. All information is subject to change
without notice. We make no attempt to review any state or local laws, or to address estate or inheritance laws or other tax consequences
of annuity ownership or receipt of distributions. You should consult a competent tax adviser to learn how tax laws apply to
your annuity interests.
�
Section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the
"Code") governs taxation of annuities in general and Code Section 817 provides rules regarding the tax treatment of variable
annuities. Other Code sections may also impact taxation of your variable annuity investment and/or earnings.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA32�
���
�
Tax Deferrals During Accumulation Period
An important
feature of variable annuities is tax-deferred treatment of earnings during the accumulation phase. An individual owner is not taxed
on increases in the value of a Policy until a withdrawal occurs, either in the form of a non-periodic payment or as annuity payments
under the settlement option selected.
�
Taxation of Withdrawals
Withdrawals are included in gross income to the extent of any allocable
income. Any amount in excess of the investment in the Policy is allocable to income. Accordingly, withdrawals are treated as coming
first from the earnings, then, only after the income portion is exhausted, as coming from principal.
�
If you make a withdrawal, not
only is the income portion of such a distribution subject to federal income taxation, but a 10% penalty may apply. However, the
penalty does not apply to distributions:

�after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2;

�upon the death of the Owner;

�if the taxpayer is defined as totally disabled;


�as periodic withdrawals that are a series of substantially equal periodic payments
made at least annually for the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or for the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
the taxpayer and the beneficiary;


�under an immediate annuity; or

�under certain other limited circumstances.
�
Taxation of Annuity Payments
Earnings from a variable annuity
are taxable only upon withdrawal and are treated as ordinary income. Generally, the Code provides
for the return of your investment in an annuity policy in equal tax-free amounts over the annuity payout period. Fixed annuity
payment amounts may be excluded from taxable income based on the ratio of the investment in the Policy to the total expected value
of annuity payments. The remaining balance of each payment is taxable income. After you recover your
investment in the Policy, any payment you receive is fully taxable. The
taxable portion of any annuity payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.
�
Taxation of Death Proceeds
A death benefit paid under the Policy
may be taxable income to the beneficiary. The rules on taxation of an annuity apply. Estate taxes
may also apply to your estate, even if all or a portion of the benefit is subject to federal income taxes.
To be treated as an annuity, a Policy must provide that: (1) if an Owner dies: (a) on or after the annuity starting date,
and (b) before the entire interest in the Policy is distributed, the balance will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the
method being used at the date of death, and (2) if the Owner dies before the annuity starting date, the entire interest must be
distributed within five years of death. However, if an individual is designated as beneficiary they may take distribution over
their life expectancy. If distributed in a lump sum, the death benefit amount is taxed in the same manner as a full withdrawal.
If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the Owner it is possible to continue deferring taxes on the accrued and future income
of the Policy until payments are made to the surviving spouse.
�
Tax Treatment of Assignments and Transfers
An assignment or pledge of an annuity Policy is
treated as a withdrawal. Also, the Code (particularly for tax-qualified plans) and ERISA in some circumstances prohibit such transactions,
subjecting them to income tax and additional excise tax. Therefore, you should consult a competent tax adviser if you wish to assign
or pledge your Policy.
�
Tax Treatments by Type of Owner
A Policy held by an entity other than a natural person, such as a
corporation, estate or trust, usually is not treated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes unless annuity payments start
within a year. The income on such a Policy is taxable in the year received or accrued by the Owner. However, this rule does not
apply if the entity as Owner is acting as an agent for an individual or is an estate that acquired the Policy as a result of the
death of the decedent. Nor does it apply if the Policy is held by certain qualified plans, is held pursuant to a qualified funding
trust (structured settlement plan), or if an employer purchased the Policy under a terminated qualified plan. You
should consult your tax adviser before purchasing a Policy to be owned by a non-natural person.
�
Annuity Used to Fund Qualified Plan
The Policy is designed for use
with various qualified plans, including:

�Individual Retirement Annuities (IRAs), Code Section 408(b);

�Simplified Employee Pension (SEP IRA), Code Section 408(k);

�Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLE IRA), Code Section 408(p); and

�Roth IRAs, Code Section 408A.
�
The Policy will not provide additional
tax deferral benefits if it is used to fund a tax-deferred qualified plan. However, Policy features and benefits other than tax
deferral may make it an appropriate investment for a qualified plan. You should review the annuity features, including all benefits
and expenses, prior to purchasing a variable annuity. Tax rules for qualified plans are very complex and vary according to the
�


Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA33�
���
type and terms of the plan,
as well as individual facts and circumstances. Each purchaser should obtain advice from a competent tax adviser prior to
purchasing a Policy issued under a qualified plan.
�
The company reserves the right to limit the availability of the Policy
for use with any of the plans listed above or to modify the Policy to conform to tax requirements. Some retirement plans are subject
to requirements that we have not incorporated into our administrative procedures. Unless we specifically consent, we are not bound
by plan requirements to the extent that they conflict with the terms of the Policy.
�
Tax Impact on Account Value
Certain Policy
credits are treated as taxable "earnings" and not "investments" for tax purposes. Taxable earnings are considered
paid out first, followed by the return of your premiums (investment amounts).

About Our Company
Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. ("Ameritas Life") issues
the Policy described in this prospectus and is responsible for providing each Policy's insurance and annuity benefits. We are a
stock life insurance company organized under the insurance laws of the State of Nebraska - Nebraska's first insurance company -
in business since 1887. We are engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuities, group dental, vision and hearing
care insurance, retirement plans and 401(k) plans throughout the United States, except in the State of New York. We are an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Ameritas Mutual Holding Company. Our address is 5900 O Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68510. (See the TABLE
OF CONTENTS page of this prospectus, or the cover page or last page for information on how to contact us.)
�
Ameritas Life relies on the exemption provided by Rule 12h-7 to file
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
�
Distribution of the Policies
Ameritas Investment Corp. ("AIC"), 5900 O Street, Lincoln,
Nebraska 68510, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Ameritas Life, is the principal underwriter of the Policies. We may pay AIC
at a rate of up to 0.05% of all premium received for underwriting. AIC enters into contracts with various broker-dealers ("Distributors")
to distribute Policies. All persons selling the Policy will be registered representatives of the Distributors or AIC, and also
will be licensed as insurance agents to sell variable insurance products. AIC is a federally registered broker-dealer and member
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). There is no premium load to cover sales and distribution expenses.
The underwriting fee paid to AIC for serving as principal underwriter will be paid by us from our other assets or surplus in our
general account, which may include profits derived from mortality and expense risk charges and other charges made under the Policies.
Policies can also be purchased from us through salaried employees who are registered representatives of AIC and who will not receive
compensation related to the purchase.
�
Voting Rights
As required by law, we will vote the Subaccount shares in the underlying
portfolios at regular and special shareholder meetings of the series funds pursuant to instructions received from persons having
voting interests in the underlying portfolios. The underlying portfolios may not hold routine annual shareholder meetings.
�
If you send us written voting instructions, we will follow your instructions
in voting the Portfolio shares attributable to your Policy. If you do not send us written instructions, we will vote the shares
attributable to your Policy in the same proportions as we vote the shares for which we have received instructions from other Policy
Owners. We will vote shares that we hold in the same proportions as we vote the shares for which we have received instructions
from other Policy Owners. It is possible that a small number of Policy Owners can determine the outcome of a voting proposal.
�
Legal Proceedings
We and our subsidiaries, like other life insurance companies, are
subject to regulatory and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Certain of the proceedings we are involved
in assert claims for substantial amounts. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of any pending
or future case, legal proceeding or regulatory action, we do not expect the ultimate result of any of these actions to result in
a material adverse effect on the Separate Account, our ability to meet our obligations under the Policies, or AIC's ability to
perform its obligations. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent
unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material
adverse effect on any or all of the above.

�
PROVISIONS OF IRA LAW
This disclosure is applicable when our variable annuity Policy is
used for a Traditional IRA, Spousal IRA, Rollover IRA, or a Roth IRA. Additionally, this disclosure provides basic information
for when our variable annuity Policy is used for a Simplified Employee Pension (SEP IRA), or Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees
(SIMPLE IRA). A separate policy must be purchased for each individual under each arrangement/plan. While Internal Revenue
Code ("IRC") provisions for IRAs are similar for all such arrangements/plans, certain differences are set forth below.
�
Traditional IRA
Eligibility
You are eligible to establish a Traditional IRA if you are younger
than age 70� and if, at any time during the year, you receive compensation or earned income that is includible in your gross
income. Your spouse may also establish a "spousal IRA" that you may contribute to out of your compensation or earned
income for any year before the year in which your spouse reaches age 70�. To contribute to a spousal IRA, you and your spouse
must file a joint tax return for the taxable year.
�
Annual Contribution Limits
You may make annual contributions to a Traditional IRA of up to the
Annual Contribution Limit of $5,500 in 2015, or 100% of your earned income (compensation), whichever is less. If you are age 50
or older, the Annual Contribution Limit is increased by $1,000, so long as your earned income or compensation is greater than the
Annual Contribution Limit. The Annual Contribution Limit is required to be increased by the IRS to reflect increases in inflation.
�
If you and your spouse both work and have compensation that is includible
in your gross income, each of you can annually contribute to a separate Traditional IRA up to the lesser of the Annual Contribution
Limit or 100% of your compensation or earned income. However, if one spouse earns less than the Annual Contribution Limit, but
both spouses together earn at least twice the Annual Contribution Limit, it may be advantageous to use the spousal IRA provision.
The total contributions to both IRAs may not exceed the lesser of twice the Annual Contribution Limit or 100% of you and your spouse's
combined compensation or earned income.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA35�
���
�
The combined limit on contributions to both Traditional and Roth
IRAs for a single calendar year for you may not exceed the Annual Contribution Limit (or twice the Annual Contribution Limit for
a couple filing jointly).
�
Distributions from another IRA or certain other qualified plans may
be "rolled over" into an IRA and such rollover contributions are not limited by this annual maximum.
�
Contributions must be made by the due date, not including extensions,
for filing your tax return.  A contribution made between January 1 and the filing due date for your tax return must be submitted
with written direction that it is being made for the prior tax year or it will be treated as made for the current tax year.
�
The amount of permissible contributions may or may not be tax-deductible
depending on whether you are an active participant in an employer sponsored retirement plan and whether your adjusted gross income
("AGI") is above the phase-out level.
�
Deductibility of Contributions
Contributions made for the tax year may
be fully deductible if neither you nor your spouse (if you are married) is an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement
plan (including qualified pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, 401(k) plans, SEP plans, SIMPLE IRA, SIMPLE 401(k) plans, and certain
governmental plans) for any part of such year and if you have not attained age 70�.
�
If you are an active participant in an employer
sponsored retirement plan you may make deductible contributions if your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is below a threshold level
of income. For single taxpayers and married taxpayers (who are filing jointly and are both active participants) the available deduction
is reduced proportionately over a phase out range. If you are married and an active participant in an employer retirement plan,
but file a separate tax return from your spouse, your deduction is phased out between $0 and $10,000 of AGI.
�
Active participants with income above the phase out range are not
entitled to an IRA deduction. The phase out limits are as follows:
�


�
�
Married Filing Jointly
Single/Head of Household

�
Year
AGI
AGI

�
�
�
�

�
2013
$95,000 - $115,000
$59,000 - $69,000

�
2014
$96,000 - $116,000
$60,000 - $70,000

�
2015
$98,000 - $118,000
$61,000 - $71,000

�
If you are not an active participant in an employer
sponsored plan, but your spouse is an active participant, you may take a full deduction for your IRA contribution (other than to
a Roth IRA) if your AGI is below $183,000; and the deductible contribution for you is phased out between $183,000 and $193,000
of AGI.
�
Even if you will not be able to deduct the full
amount of your Traditional IRA contribution, you can still contribute up to the Annual Contribution Limit with all or part of the
contribution being non-deductible. The combined total must not exceed your Annual Contribution Limit. Any earnings on all your
Traditional IRA contributions accumulate tax-free until you withdraw them.
�
Excess Contributions
If you contribute in excess of the maximum contribution limit allowed
in any year, the excess contribution could be subject to a 6% excise tax. The excess is taxed in the year the excess contribution
is made and each year that the excess remains in your Traditional IRA.
�
If you should contribute more than the maximum amount allowed, you
can eliminate the excess contribution as follows:
�
You may withdraw the excess contribution and net earnings attributable
to it before the due date for filing your federal income tax in the year the excess contribution was made. Any earnings so distributed
will be taxable in the year for which the contribution was made and may be subject to the 10% premature distribution tax.
�
If you elect not to withdraw an excess contribution, you may apply
the excess against the contribution limits in a later year. This is allowed to the extent you under-contribute in the later year.
 The 6% excise tax will be imposed in the year you make the excess contribution and each subsequent year, until eliminated.
To the extent an excess contribution is absorbed in a subsequent year by contributing less than the maximum deduction allowable
for that year, the amount absorbed will be deductible in the year applied (provided you are eligible to take a deduction).
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA36�
���
�
Distributions From Your Traditional IRA During Your Life
You may take distributions from your Traditional IRA at any time.
However, there is a 10% premature distribution tax on the amount includible in your gross income if distributed prior to you attaining
age 59�, unless: (1)�the distribution is made to a beneficiary on or after the Owner's death; (2)�the distribution
is made because of your permanent disability; (3) the distribution is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments
(made at least annually) that do not exceed the life expectancy of you and your designated beneficiary; (4)�the distribution
is made for medical expenses which exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income; (5)�the distribution is made to purchase health
insurance for the individual and/or his or her spouse and dependents if he or she: (a)�has received unemployment compensation
for 12 consecutive weeks or more; (b)�the distributions are made during the tax year that the unemployment compensation is
paid or the following tax year; and (c)�the individual has not been re-employed for 60�days or more; (6)�the
distribution is made for certain qualified higher education expenses of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or any child or grandchild
of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse; (7) the distribution is made for�the qualified first-time home buyer expenses
(up to a lifetime maximum of $10,000) incurred by you or your spouse or a child, grandchild, parent or grandparent of you or your
spouse; (8) the distribution is to satisfy a levy issued by the IRS; or (9) the distribution is a qualified reservist distribution.
Generally, the part of a distribution attributable to non-deductible contributions is not includable in income and is not subject
to the 10% penalty.
�
When you reach age 70� you must elect to receive Required
Minimum Distributions (RMD) no later than April 1 following the year in which you reach age 70� whether or not you have
retired (Required Beginning Date). There is a minimum amount which you must withdraw by the Required Beginning Date and by each
December 31 thereafter. You should consult with your own tax or financial adviser with regard to the calculation of the amount
of your minimum distribution each year to make sure this requirement is met. Failure to take the Required Minimum Distribution
could result in an additional tax of 50% of the amount not taken.
�
Distributions From Your Traditional IRA After
Your Death
If you die before all the funds in your Traditional IRA have been
distributed, the remaining funds will be distributed to your designated beneficiary as required below and as selected by such beneficiary.
�
If you die before the Required Beginning Date, your designated beneficiary
must withdraw the funds remaining as follows: 1) distributed no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the fifth
anniversary of your death occurs; or 2) distributed over the life or life expectancy of the designated beneficiary and must begin
on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the year of your death. However, if the designated beneficiary is your
spouse, payments may begin before December 31 of the calendar year in which you would have reached age 70�. If you did not
designate a proper beneficiary, the funds remaining shall be distributed within five years after your death.
�
If you die after Required Minimum Distribution payments have begun,
your designated beneficiary must select to have the remaining amount of your Traditional IRA, distributed over the longer of 1)
the beneficiary's life expectancy or 2) what your remaining life expectancy was before your death beginning no later than December
31 of the calendar year following the year of your death. If you do not designate a proper beneficiary, your interest is distributed
over what your remaining life expectancy was before your death.
�
Your surviving spouse, if the sole beneficiary, may elect to treat
your Traditional IRA as his or her own Traditional IRA.
�
Tax Consequences
Amounts paid to you or your beneficiary from your Traditional IRA
are taxable as ordinary income, except recovery of your nondeductible Traditional IRA contributions is tax-free.
�
If a minimum distribution is not made from your IRA for a tax year
in which it is required, the excess of the amount that should have been distributed over the amount that was actually distributed
is subject to an excise tax of 50%.
�
Tax-Free Rollovers
Under certain circumstances, you, your spouse, or your former spouse
(pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order) may roll over all or a portion of your distribution from another Traditional
IRA, a 401(a) qualified retirement plan, 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, governmental 457 plan, or SIMPLE plan into a Traditional IRA.
Such an event is called a Rollover and is a method for accomplishing continued tax deferral on otherwise taxable distributions
from said plans. Rollover contributions are not subject to the contribution limits on Traditional IRA contributions, but also are
not tax deductible.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA37�
���
�
There are two ways to make a Rollover to your IRA:
�

1.Participant Rollovers are accomplished by contributing part or all of the eligible distribution (which includes amounts
withheld for federal income tax purposes) to your new IRA within 60�days following receipt of the distribution. Participant
Rollover amounts may be subject to a mandatory 20% federal income tax withholding. Participant Rollovers from another Traditional
IRA, as well as Direct Rollovers (see below), are not subject to mandatory withholding. Traditional IRA to Traditional IRA Rollovers
are limited to one per 12�month period. However, you may transfer Traditional IRA assets to another Traditional IRA (where
you do not directly receive a distribution) and such transfers are not subject to this limitation. Distributions from a SIMPLE
IRA may not be rolled over or transferred to an IRA (which isn't a SIMPLE IRA) during the 2-year period following the date you
first participate in any SIMPLE Plan maintained by your employer.
�

2.Direct Rollovers are made by instructing the plan trustee, custodian, or issuer to pay the eligible portion of your
distribution directly to the trustee, custodian or issuer of the receiving IRA. Direct Rollover amounts are not subject to mandatory
federal income tax withholding.
�
Certain distributions are not considered to be
eligible for Rollover and include:



a.
distributions which are part of a series of substantially
equal periodic payments (made at least annually) for 10�years or more;

b.
required minimum distributions made during or after
the year you reach age 70�;

c.
any hardship distributions made under the terms of
the plan; and

d.
amounts in excess of the cash (except for certain
loan offset amounts) or in excess of the proceeds from the sale of property distributed.


�
Under certain circumstances, you may roll over all or a portion of
your eligible distribution from your Traditional IRA to a 401(a) qualified retirement plan, 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, or governmental
457 (No Traditional IRA Rollovers to Simple IRAs are allowed). However, you may not roll after-tax contributions from your Traditional
IRA to a 401(a), 401(k) plan, 403(b) plan, or governmental 457 plan.
�
For rules applicable to rollovers or transfers to Roth IRAs, see
the paragraphs on Roth IRA. 
�
SEP IRA
A SEP Plan allows self-employed people and small business owners
to establish Simplified Employee Pensions for the business owner and eligible employees, if any. SEP IRAs have specific eligibility
and contribution limits (as described in IRS Form 5305-SEP); otherwise SEP IRAs generally follow the same rules as Traditional
IRAs.
�
SIMPLE IRA
SIMPLE IRAs operate in connection with a Savings Incentive Match
Plan for Employees maintained by an eligible employer. Each participating employee has a SIMPLE IRA to receive contributions under
the plan. SIMPLE IRAs have specific rules regarding eligibility, contribution, and tax-withdrawal penalties (as described in IRS
Form 5304-SIMPLE); otherwise, SIMPLE IRAs generally follow the same rules as Traditional IRAs.
�
ROTH IRA
Eligibility
You are eligible to make annual contributions to a Roth IRA if you
receive compensation from employment, earnings from self-employment, or alimony, and your (and your spouse's) AGI is within the
limits described below. Also, you may contribute to a different Roth IRA, established by your spouse (spousal Roth IRA), out of
your compensation or earned income for any year. Unlike Traditional IRAs, if eligible, you may contribute to a Roth IRA even after
age 70�.
�
Limit on Annual Contributions
You can make annual contributions to a Roth IRA of up to the Annual
Contribution Limit or 100% of your compensation or earned income, whichever is less, subject to the limitations below. The Annual
Contribution Limit is $5,500 for 2015. If you are age 50 or older, the Annual Contribution Limit is increased by $1,000, so long
as your earned income or compensation is greater than the Annual Contribution Limit. The Annual Contribution Limit is required
to be increased by the IRS to reflect increases in inflation.
�
If each spouse earns at least the Annual Contribution Limit, each
of you may make the maximum contribution to his or her Roth IRA, subject to the limitations discussed below. However, if one spouse
earns less than the Annual Contribution Limit, but both spouses together earn at least twice the Annual Contribution Limit, it
may be advantageous to use the spousal Roth IRA. The total contributions to both Roth IRAs may not exceed the lesser of twice the
Annual Contribution Limit or 100% of you and your spouse's combined compensation or earned income.
�

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA38�
���
�
The Annual Contribution Limit is the maximum that can be contributed
to all IRAs (Roth and Traditional) by an individual in a year. The maximum amount that may be contributed to your Roth IRA is always
reduced by any amount that you have contributed to your Traditional IRAs for the year.
�
The maximum amount you or your spouse may contribute to a Roth IRA
is limited based on your tax filing status and your (and your spouse's) AGI. You may contribute the maximum contribution to your
Roth IRA if you are single and your AGI is less than $116,000. Your ability to contribute to your Roth IRA is phased out at $131,000.
You may contribute the maximum contribution to your Roth IRA if you are married filing jointly and your AGI is less than $183,000.
Your ability to contribute to your Roth IRA is phased out at $193,000.
�
Roth IRA contributions must be made by the due date, not including
extensions, for filing your tax return. A contribution made between January 1 and the filing due date for your return must be
submitted with written direction that it is being made for the prior tax year or it will be treated as made for the current tax
year.
�
Deductibility of Contributions
Unlike a Traditional IRA, contributions to your Roth IRA are not
deductible.
�
Excess Contributions
If you contribute in excess of the maximum contribution limit allowed
in any year, the excess contribution could be subject to a 6% excise tax. The excess is taxed in the year the excess contribution
is made and each year that the excess remains in your Roth IRA.
�
If you should contribute more than the maximum amount allowed, you
can eliminate the excess contribution as follows:

�You may withdraw the excess contribution and net earnings attributable to it before the due date for filing your federal income
tax in the year the excess contribution was made. Any earnings so distributed will be taxable in the year for which the contribution
was made and may be subject to the 10% premature distribution tax.

�If you elect not to withdraw an excess contribution, you may apply
the excess against the contribution limits in a later year. This is allowed to the extent you under-contribute in the later year.
The 6% excise tax will be imposed in the year you make the excess contribution and each subsequent year, until eliminated. To the
extent an excess contribution is absorbed in a subsequent year by contributing less than the maximum deduction allowable for that
year, the amount absorbed will be deductible in the year applied (provided you are eligible to take a deduction).
�
Tax on Withdrawals From Your Roth IRA
You can make
withdrawals from your Roth IRA at any time and the principal amounts that you contributed are always available to be withdrawn
by you tax-free. Withdrawal of amounts considered earnings or growth will also be tax-free if the following requirements are met:
the withdrawal must satisfy the five-year holding period and be made either on or after you reach 59�, due to your death
or disability, or for qualified first-time homebuyer expenses.
�
If the requirements
for a tax-free withdrawal are not met, a withdrawal consisting of your own prior contribution amounts for your Roth IRA will not
be considered taxable in the year you receive it, nor will the 10% penalty apply. A non-qualified withdrawal that is considered
earnings on your contributions is includible in your gross income and may be subject to the 10% withdrawal penalty. Also, the 10%
premature distribution penalty tax may apply to conversion amounts distributed even though they are not includable in income, if
the distribution is made within the 5-taxable-year period beginning on the first day of the individual's taxable year in
which the conversion contribution was made.
�
Required Payments From Your Roth IRA
Unlike a Traditional IRA, while you are living, there are no distribution
requirements for your Roth IRA.
�
After your death, if you have begun to receive distributions under
an annuity option (not including an interest only option), the remaining Policy value will continue to be distributed to your designated
beneficiary according to the terms of the elected options, provided that method satisfies IRC requirements.
�
If you die before your entire interest in the Policy is distributed,
your entire interest in your Roth IRA generally must be distributed no later than the end of the fifth calendar year after your
death occurs ("five-year payout rule"). Your designated beneficiary may elect to receive distributions over a period
not longer than his or her life expectancy, if the election is made and distributions begin on or before the end of the year following
the year of your death. Otherwise, the entire benefit must be paid under the five-year payout rule.
�
If the designated beneficiary is your surviving spouse, the spouse
may elect to treat the Roth IRA as his or her own.

Ameritas Advisor No-Load VA39�
���
�
Rollovers and Conversions
You may roll over any amount from an existing Roth IRA to another
Roth IRA. Under certain circumstances, you may also convert an existing Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. You can roll over distributions
from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA if you convert such amounts within 60 days after distribution. Note that rollover contributions
to a Roth IRA are included in taxable income and may result in additional tax. There may be additional income tax consequences
upon a conversion. Consult your financial adviser to determine other considerations when converting a Traditional IRA
to a Roth IRA.
�
Recharacterization
You may correct an IRA conversion by recharacterizing your conversion.
For example, you may have converted from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and decide later you do not want to make the conversion.
You may accomplish a recharacterization by making a trustee-to-trustee transfer (including any net income attributable to the contribution)
from the first IRA to the second IRA, on or before your tax return due date for reporting the contribution to the first IRA. Once
the transfer is made, the election is irrevocable. Recharacterizing a contribution treats it as contributed to the second IRA on
the same date as initially contributed to the first IRA. If you elect to recharacterize a contribution, you must report it on your
Federal income tax return as made to the second IRA, instead of the first. Consult your tax adviser before recharacterizing
a contribution.
�
General Information
and Restrictions for All IRAs
�
Lump Sum Distribution
If you decide to receive the entire
value of your IRA Plan in one lump sum, the full amount is taxable when received (except as to non-deductible contributions
to a Traditional IRA or to a Roth IRA, or "qualified distributions" from a Roth IRA), and is not eligible for the special
5 or 10 year averaging tax rules under IRC Section�402 on lump sum distributions which may be available for other types of
Qualified Retirement Plans.
�
Nontransferability
You may not transfer, assign, or sell your IRA to anyone (except
in the case of transfer incident to divorce).
�
Nonforfeitability
The value of your IRA belongs to you at all times, without risk of
forfeiture.
�
Loans and Prohibited Transactions
If you engage in a so-called prohibited transaction as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code, your IRA will be disqualified and the entire taxable balance in your Traditional IRA account, and the
amount of earnings or gains in your Roth IRA account, will be taxed as ordinary income in the year of the transaction. You may
also have to pay the 10% penalty tax. For example, IRAs do not permit loans. You may not borrow from your IRA (including Roth IRAs)
or pledge it as security for a loan. A loan would disqualify your entire IRA and be treated as a distribution. It would be includable
in your taxable income in the year of violation and subject to the 10% penalty tax on premature distributions. A pledge of your
IRA as security for a loan would cause a constructive distribution of the portion pledged and also be subject to the 10% penalty
tax.
�
Financial Disclosure
Contributions to your IRA will be invested in a variable annuity
Policy. The variable annuity Policy, its operation, and all related fees and expenses are explained in detail in the prospectus
to which this Disclosure Statement is attached.
�
Growth in the value of your variable annuity Policy IRA cannot be
guaranteed or projected. The income and expenses of your variable annuity Policy will affect the value of your IRA. Dividends from
net income earned are reduced by investment advisory fees and also by certain other costs. For an explanation of these fees and
other costs, please refer to your prospectus.
�
Status of Our IRA Plan
We may, but are not obligated to, seek IRS approval of your Traditional
IRA or Roth IRA form. Approval by the IRS is optional to us as the issuer. Approval by the IRS is to form only and does not represent
a determination of the merits of the Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.

�
CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE
When we advertise performance for a Subaccount (except any money
market Subaccount), we will include quotations of standardized average annual total return to facilitate comparison with standardized
average annual total return advertised by other variable annuity separate accounts. Standardized average annual total return for
a Subaccount will be shown for periods beginning on the date the Subaccount first invested in a corresponding series fund portfolio.
We will calculate standardized average annual total return according to the standard methods prescribed by rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
�
We report average annual total return information via Internet and
periodic printed reports. Average annual total return quotations on our Internet website will be current as of the previous Business
Day. Printed average annual total return information may be current to the last Business Day of the previous calendar week, month,
or quarter preceding the date on which a report is submitted for publication. Both standardized average annual total return quotations
and non-standardized total return quotations will cover at least periods of one, five, and ten years, or a period covering
the time the Subaccount has been in existence, if it has not been in existence for one of the prescribed periods. If the corresponding
series fund portfolio has been in existence for longer than the Subaccount, the non-standardized total return quotations will
show the investment performance the Subaccount would have achieved (reduced by the applicable charges) had it been invested in
the series fund portfolio for the period quoted; this is referred to as "adjusted historical" performance reporting.
Standardized average annual total return is not available for periods before the Subaccount was in existence.
�
Quotations of standardized average annual total return and non-standardized
total return are based on historical earnings and will fluctuate. Any quotation of performance should not be considered a guarantee
of future performance. Factors affecting the performance of a Subaccount and its corresponding series fund portfolio include general
market conditions, operating expenses and investment management. An Owner's withdrawal value upon surrender of a Policy may be
more or less than the premium invested in the Policy.
Ameritas Advisor No-Load VASAI:2STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
�
�
Standardized Performance Reporting
Standardized average annual total return for a
specific period is calculated by taking a hypothetical $1,000 investment in a Subaccount at the beginning of the period ("initial
investment"), and computing the ending redeemable value ("redeemable value") of that investment at the end of the
period. The redeemable value is then divided by the initial investment and expressed as a percentage, carried to at least the nearest
hundredth of a percent. Standardized average annual total return is annualized and reflects the deduction of the current mortality
and expense fee and the current annual Policy Fee. No deduction is made for premium taxes which may be assessed by certain states.
�
Non-Standardized Performance Reporting
We may also advertise non-standardized total return. Non-standardized
total return may assume: (1) the Policy is not surrendered; (2) the Subaccounts have existed for periods other than those required
to be presented; (3) current charges are incurred if they are less than the Policy's guaranteed maximum charges; or (4) may differ
from standardized average annual total return in other ways disclosed in the table description. Non-standardized total return
may also assume a larger initial investment which more closely approximates the size of a typical Policy. For these reasons, non-standardized
total returns for a Subaccount are usually higher than standardized total returns for a Subaccount.
�
Yields
We may advertise the current annualized yield for a 30-day period
for a Subaccount. The annualized yield of a Subaccount refers to the income generated by the Subaccount over a specified 30-day
period. Because this yield is annualized, the yield generated by a Subaccount during the 30-day period is assumed to be generated
each 30-day period.  The yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per Accumulation Unit earned during
the period by the price per unit on the last day of the period, according to the following formula:
�
YIELD=2[(a-b+1)6-1]
cd
�
Where a=net investment income earned during the period by the
portfolio company attributable to shares owned by the Subaccount, b=expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements), c=the
average daily number of Accumulation Units outstanding during the period, and d=the maximum offering price per Accumulation Unit
on the last day of the period. The yield reflects the base Policy mortality and expense risk fee and administrative expense charge.
Net investment income will be determined according to rules established by the SEC. The yield assumes an average Policy size of
$75,000.
�
Because of the charges and deductions imposed by the Separate Account,
the yield for a Subaccount will be lower than the yield for the corresponding series fund portfolio. The yield on amounts held
in the Subaccount normally will fluctuate over time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given period is not an indication or
representation of future yields or rates of return. A Subaccount's actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of portfolio
securities held by the series fund and the series fund's operating expenses.
�
Any current yield quotations of a money market
Subaccount, subject to Rule 482 of the Securities Act of 1933, will consist of a seven calendar day historical yield, carried at
least to the nearest hundredth of a percent. We may advertise yield for the Subaccount based on different time periods, but we
will accompany it with a yield quotation based on a seven-day calendar period. A money market Subaccount's yield
will be calculated by determining the net change, exclusive of capital changes, in the value of a hypothetical pre-existing
Policy having a balance of one Accumulation Unit at the beginning of the base period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting
those Policy deductions stated above, and dividing the net change in Policy value by the value of the Policy at the beginning of
the period to obtain a base period return and multiplying the base period return by (365/7). A money market Subaccount's effective
yield is computed similarly but includes the effect of assumed compounding on an annualized basis of the current yield
quotations of the Subaccount.
�
A money market Subaccount's yield and effective yield will fluctuate
daily. Actual yields will depend on factors such as the type of instruments in the series fund's portfolio, portfolio quality and
average maturity, changes in interest rates, and the series fund's expenses. Although we determine the Subaccount's yield on the
basis of a seven calendar day period, we may use a different time period on occasion. The yield quotes may reflect the expense
limitations described in the series fund's prospectus or Statement of Additional Information. There is no assurance that the yields
quoted on any given occasion will be maintained for any period of time and there is no guarantee that the net asset values will
remain constant. It should be noted that neither a Policy owner's investment in a money market Subaccount nor that Subaccount's
investment in the underlying money market series fund portfolio is guaranteed or insured. Yields of other money market funds may
not be comparable if a different base or another method of calculation is used.

As of March 31, 2015, there were 628 qualified contracts and 2,943
non-qualified contracts in the Separate Account.
�
�
Item 28.	Indemnification
�
Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.�s By-laws provide as follows:
�
"The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was, or is a
party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses including attorney�s fees, judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to the full extent authorized
by the laws of Nebraska."
�
Section 21-20,103 of the Nebraska Business Corporation Act, in general,
allows a corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against liability by him or her in
connection with an action, suit or proceeding, if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to
be in or not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
�
In a case of a derivative action, no indemnification shall be made
in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct
in the performance of his or her duty to the corporation, unless a court in which the action was brought shall determine that such
person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such expenses which the Court shall deem proper.
�
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions,
or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification
is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Supplementary Information:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations
1. Ameritas is a stock life insurance company organized in the State of Nebraska and currently licensed to sell life insurance in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. Ameritas is a subsidiary of AmeritasAcacia Mutual Holding Company. 
2. The Separate Account was established by Ameritas on August 26, 1995, to receive and invest premiums received from purchasers of certain variable annuity contracts issued by Ameritas. The Separate Account is registered with the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts funded by the Separate Account are registered with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933 Act”). The income, capital gains and capital losses incurred on the assets of the Separate Account are Start Printed Page 39087credited to, or charged against, the assets of the Separate Account without regard to the income, capital gains or capital losses arising out of any other business Ameritas may conduct. In addition, the laws of the State of Nebraska, under which the Applicants were established provide that assets in each such Separate Account attributable to the annuity contracts funded by such Account are generally not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business which Ameritas may conduct. 
3. The Separate Account currently serves as the funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts (“VA Contracts”) registered under the 1933 Act. The Separate Account is divided into separate subaccounts (“Subaccounts”) that each invest exclusively in shares of an underlying fund. Owners of the VA Contracts are currently permitted to accumulate funds, on a tax-deferred basis, based on the investment experience of the assets underlying the VA Contract. The VA Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax qualified basis or in connection with certain plans qualifying for favorable federal income tax treatment. Owners of a VA Contract can allocate premium payments to one or more Subaccounts and/or to the Fixed Account. Owners of a VA Contract may make up to 15 transfers of cash values among the Subaccounts each year without charge; transfers in excess of 15 in any year may be subject to a charge. Owners of VA Contracts are also subject to certain administrative and other charges and may be subject to certain surrender charges. 
4. The Separate Account currently makes available to owners of VA Contracts a total of forty-five separate investment options, as well as the option to allocate premiums to the insurance company Fixed Account. 
5. Prior to October 1, 2001, the Separate Account also offered a subaccount (“Strong Subaccount”) that invested exclusively in shares of Strong International Stock Fund II, (“Strong International”). Shares of Strong International are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File No. 33-45108). Strong Capital Management, Inc., serves as the investment adviser for Strong International. Ameritas discontinued offering the Strong Subaccount as an investment option under VA Contracts as of October 1, 2001. Owners of VA Contracts with interests in the Strong Subaccount were, and continue to be, permitted to remain in the subaccount, but no new investments in the subaccount are being accepted. 
6. Shares of Vanguard International Portfolio (“Vanguard International”) are registered under the 1933 Act on Form N-1A (File No. 33-32216). Vanguard International is a separate investment portfolio of the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund and has been available to owners of VA Contracts since May 2001. Schroder Investment Management North America, Inc., serves as the investment adviser for Vanguard International. 
7. The investment objective of both Vanguard International and Strong International is capital growth. Each fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in equity securities of foreign issuers. Neither fund is limited with respect to the nations in which investments may be made or the capitalization of the companies in which they invest. 
8. Strong International and Vanguard International differ with respect to the relative emphasis placed by each fund's investment adviser on various investment criteria. As stated in the prospectus relating to Strong International, that fund's investment adviser selects securities for the fund using an investment approach that examines the investment outlook of individual countries in determining whether to invest; identifies individual investments based on rigorous, in-depth analysis of the individual characteristics of the issuer involved; and seeks to manage foreign currency risk. The investment adviser for Vanguard International considers similar factors, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Vanguard International's investment adviser first examines the investment outlook of foreign markets around the world, then determines the proportion of the fund's assets to allocate to individual countries before selecting companies' securities within such countries based upon a selection process emphasizing on-site evaluations of the companies. The adviser's investment approach results in a fund portfolio whose overall characteristics often differ substantially from those of broad international stock indexes and are therefore apt to differ substantially from time to time from the performance of such indexes. 
9. Applicants propose to substitute securities of Vanguard International for securities issued by Strong International (the “Substitution”). 
10. Applicants state that although not identical, Vanguard International and Strong International afford their shareholders very similar investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the objectives and policies of Vanguard International are the same as, or sufficiently similar to, those of Strong International to assure that the core investment goals of those owners of the VA Contracts affected by the Substitution (“Affected Contractowners”) will not be frustrated and the investment expectations of Affected Contractowners can continue to be met. Further, Applicants state that the Substitution will reduce the expenses of the Affected Contractowners because Vanguard International is larger and less expensive than Strong International and because Vanguard International has a performance record that is both comparable to, and less volatile than, that of Strong International. 
11. The following table summarizes the annual operating expenses to which holders of shares of Strong International have been and which holders of shares of Vanguard International are subject. The table does not include any fees or sales charges imposed by those VA contracts issued by Ameritas. The figures shown below are based on the assets of Strong International and Vanguard International as of December 31, 2001.
 Strong  International (percent)Vanguard  International (percent)Management Fees1.000.16Distribution and service (12b-1) feesOther Expenses0.030.27Total before Waivers and Reductions1.030.43Waivers and ReductionsTotal after Waivers and Reductions1.030.43
12. On April 6, 2001, Applicants were notified by Strong International that it had suspended sales to new insurance company separate accounts and, on June 1, 2001, received a second notice from Strong International stating that it intended to close to existing relationships. 
13. A prospectus supplement dated September 21, 2001, was distributed to all owners of VA Contracts. The supplement stated, among other things, that the Strong Subaccount would not be available as an investment option under the VA Contracts as of October 1, 2001, and that Applicants intended to file an application with the Commission to substitute other investment options for Strong International. 
14. Following the date on which Ameritas is notified that the notice of this Application is to be published in the Federal Register, but before the date the Requested Order becomes effective, Start Printed Page 39088Ameritas will forward to Affected Contractowners a notice describing the Substitution that will affect their interest in the VA Contracts, including the anticipated effective date of the Substitution. The notice will be accompanied by a copy of the portfolio prospectus for Vanguard International. This Notice will inform Affected Contractowners of (i) the anticipated effective date of the Substitution; (ii) the right of each Affected Contractowner under the VA Contracts to transfer contract values among the various Subaccounts; and (iii) the fact that any such transfer that involves a transfer from Strong International will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of the “free transfers” to which Affected Contractowners may otherwise be entitled. The notice will advise Contractowners that cash values attributable to investments in Strong International may be transferred to any other available Subaccount, without regard to any transfer charge or other restriction to which transfers between Subaccounts may otherwise be subject, for not less than 30 days after the effective date of the Substitution. All such transfers will be made at the relative net asset value on the date on which the Affected Contractowner elects to make the transfer. 
15. Within five days after the effective date of the Substitution, Ameritas will forward to Affected Contractowners a written confirmation notice relating to the substitution transaction. The confirmation notice will (i) confirm that such transaction was carried out; (ii) again advise Affected Contractowners that cash values attributable to investments in Strong International may be transferred to any other available Subaccount, without regard to any transfer charge or other restriction to which transfers between Subaccounts may otherwise be subject, for not less than 30 days after the effective date of the Substitution; (iii) advise Affected Contractowners that no transfer made by Affected Contractowners during this period will be counted as one of the “free” transfers to which such owners may otherwise be entitled under the Subject Contract held; and (iv) state that Ameritas will not exercise any right reserved by it under the Subject Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers from cash value attributable to investment in Strong International until at least 30 days after the effective date of the Substitution. 
16. As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of Strong International held by the Strong Subaccount will be presented to Strong International for cash redemption. The proceeds of such cash redemptions will then be used to purchase the appropriate number of shares of Vanguard International. On the effective date of the Substitution, the cash values of Affected Contractowners will be transferred to Vanguard International, and the Strong Subaccount will then be eliminated. The Substitution will take place at net asset value, with no change in the contract value of any Affected Contractowner, and all cash redemptions of shares of Strong International and purchases of shares of Vanguard International will be effected in accordance with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. 
17. Ameritas will bear the costs of the Substitution, including any legal, accounting and brokerage fees and expenses relating to them. Affected Contractowners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitution. No current fees or charges applicable under the Subject Contracts will be increased as a result of the Substitution, nor will the rights of the owners of the Subject Contracts or the obligations of Ameritas under the Subject Contracts be diminished. The Substitution will not alter in any way the annuity, life or tax benefits afforded under the VA Contracts held by any Affected Contractowner. The Substitution will not result in any adverse tax consequences to the owners of the Subject Contracts, any change in the economic interest or contract values of any such owner or any change in the dollar value of the Subject Contracts held by any Affected Contractowner. Finally, Affected Contractowners will be permitted to withdraw amounts from the VA Contracts held, or to terminate their interest in any such contract, under the conditions set forth in the contracts. 
18. Applicants state that Applicants will not receive for three years from the date of the substitutions, any direct or indirect benefit from Vanguard International, its advisers or underwriters, or from affiliates of Vanguard International, its advisers or underwriters in connection with assets attributable to Contracts affected by the substitution, at a higher rate than Applicants have received from Strong International, its advisers or underwriters, or from affiliates of Strong International, its advisers or underwriters, including, without limitation, Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder service or administrative or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements. Applicants represent that the substitutions and the selection of Vanguard International was not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to Applicants or any affiliate of Applicants by Vanguard International, its advisors or underwriters, or by affiliates of them. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that “it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution.” Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act also provides that the Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
2. Applicants request an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the substitution. Applicants assert that the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the 1940 Act. 
3. Each Subject Contract reserves to the issuing insurance company the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another open-end management investment company for shares of an open-end management company held by a Subaccount of the Separate Account. This reservation of rights is disclosed in the prospectus for the Subject Contracts. 
4. Applicants assert that Vanguard International and Strong International afford their shareholders very similar investment opportunities. Applicants state that from an investment perspective, the only difference between Strong International and Vanguard International lies in the relative emphasis placed by each fund's investment adviser on various investment criteria. Applicants believe such a distinction in investment style does not require a conclusion that the proposed Substitution would not meet the standards of Section 26(c). 
5. Applicants believe that the Strong International/Vanguard International substitution satisfies the standards for relief under Section 26(c), because, following the Substitution, Affected Contractowners will be invested in Vanguard International, a fund (i) with the same investment objective as, and investment policies very similar to, those of Strong International; (ii) with actual performance which has been better on a cumulative basis than that of Strong International; and (iii) that is Start Printed Page 39089both larger than Strong International, and enjoys a lower management fee and lower overall expense ratio than Strong International. 
Conclusion 
Applicants assert that the proposed Substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and purposes of the 1940 Act and therefore request that the Substitution should be granted.

About Ameritas Holding Company

   Ameritas Mutual Holding takes the task of providing life insurance to its members seriously. The company primarily operates through Ameritas Life Insurance and Ameritas Life Insurance of New York, which provide life insurance and annuity products to about 430,000 policyholders nationwide. In addition to managing some $82 billion in life insurance policies in force, its subsidiaries also offer such services as financial planning and workplace investing. Ameritas' investment firms boast more than $34 billion of assets under management. Other companies under its umbrella include mutual fund manager Calvert Group.
   Operations

   While most of Ameritas' products are sold through Ameritas Life and Ameritas Life of New York, other life insurance operations are conducted through the company's Union Central Life Insurance (life, health, annuities, and pensions) and Acacia Life Insurance subsidiaries.
  

   Other units include Ameritas Retirement Plans and Ameritas Group (dental, hearing, and eye care plans). Ameritas Investment and Summit Investment Partners offer investment advice and asset management.
  
Geographic Reach

   Ameritas has offices in Lincoln, Nebraska; Bethesda, Maryland; Cincinnati; Falls Church, Virginia; New York City; San Antonio, Texas; and Wayne, Nebraska.
  
Sales and Marketing

   The company targets its marketing efforts towards middle- to upper-income individuals across the US, using a network of general agents, advisors, third-party administrators, and independent brokers to distribute its products.
  
Financial Performance

   Ameritas' revenues have held relatively steady over the past few years. They rose 2% to $2 billion in 2013 (versus $1.9 billion in 2012) due to an increase in premium income, contract charges, mutual fund management and related fees, and broker-dealer revenues. This was partially offset by a decline in sales and net investment income. Net income rose dramatically in 2013, increasing 75% to $136 million, as a result of higher revenues and income from discontinued operations.
  

   Cash flow from operations fell 17% to $314 million due to a decline in cash from accrued investment income and policy and contract liabilities.
  
Strategy

   In late 2013 Ameritas sold its Acacia Federal Savings Bank subsidiary to Stifel Financial, thereby refocusing its operations on core insurance and investment businesses. As such, Americas seeks to introduce new or enhanced products as opportunities arise. In 2014 Americas Group developed Defined Dental, a low-cost, fixed reimbursement dental plan for customers in Florida.
  

   Also in 2014, Ameritas completed construction of a new office building on its Forest Park campus in Cincinnati. The nearly 700,000 sq. ft. building houses some 350 employees.
  
Company Background

   With roots reaching back as far as 1867, Ameritas is the result of a 2006 merger between the Ameritas Acacia Companies and Union Central Mutual Holding. It held the name UNIFI Mutual Holding until 2012 when it changed its name to Ameritas in order to better support its national brand identity.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.
