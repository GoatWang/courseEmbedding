	EXHIBIT 1




	CHARTER OF WILMINGTON TRUST, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION







	ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION




	OF




	WILMINGTON TRUST,
	NATIONAL ASSOCIATION



	For the purpose of organizing an association to perform any lawful activities of national banks, the undersigned
	do enter into the following articles of association:


	FIRST. The title of this association shall be Wilmington Trust, National Association.


	SECOND. The main office of the association shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The general business of the
	association shall be conducted at its main office and its branches.


	THIRD. The board of directors of this association shall consist of not less than five
	nor more than twenty-five persons, unless the OCC has exempted the bank from the 25-member limit. The exact number is to be fixed and determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the full board of directors or by resolution of a
	majority of the shareholders at any annual or special meeting thereof. Each director shall own common or preferred stock of the association or of a holding company owning the association, with an aggregate par, fair market or equity value $1,000.
	Determination of these values may be based as of either (i) the date of purchase or (ii) the date the person became a director, whichever value is greater. Any combination of common or preferred stock of the association or holding company
	may be used.


	Any vacancy in the board of directors may be filled by action of a majority of the remaining directors between meetings of
	shareholders. The board of directors may not increase the number of directors between meetings of shareholders to a number which:


	 




	 


	1)


	exceeds by more than two the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 15 or less; or




	 




	 


	2)


	exceeds by more than four the number of directors last elected by shareholders where the number was 16 or more, but in no event shall the number of directors exceed 25, unless the OCC has exempted the bank from the
	25-member limit.




	Directors shall be elected for terms of one year and until their successors are elected and qualified.
	Terms of directors, including directors selected to fill vacancies, shall expire at the next regular meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected, unless the directors resign or are removed from office. Despite the expiration of a
	directors term, the director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until there is a decrease in the number of directors and his or her position is eliminated.


	Honorary or advisory members of the board of directors, without voting power or power of final decision in matters concerning the business of
	the association, may be appointed by resolution of a majority of the full board of directors, or by resolution of shareholders at any annual or special meeting. Honorary or advisory directors shall not be counted to determine the number of directors
	of the association or the presence of a quorum in connection with any board action, and shall not be required to own qualifying shares.


	FOURTH. There
	shall be an annual meeting of the shareholders to elect directors and transact whatever other business may be brought before the meeting. It shall be held at the main office or any other convenient place the board of directors may designate, on the
	day of each year specified therefor in the bylaws, or, if that day falls on a legal holiday in the state in which the association is located, on the next following banking day. If no election is held on the day fixed, or in the event of a legal
	holiday on the following banking day, an election may be held on any subsequent day within 60 days of the day fixed, to be designated by the board of directors, or, if the directors fail to fix the day, by shareholders representing two-thirds of the
	shares issued and outstanding. In all cases at least 10 days advance notice of the time, place and purpose of a shareholders meeting shall be given to the shareholders by first class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency
	circumstance exists. The sole shareholder of the bank is permitted to waive notice of the shareholders meeting.





	In all elections of directors, the number of votes each common shareholder may cast will be
	determined by multiplying the number of shares such shareholder owns by the number of directors to be elected. Those votes may be cumulated and cast for a single candidate or may be distributed among two or more candidates in the manner selected by
	the shareholder. If, after the first ballot, subsequent ballots are necessary to elect directors, a shareholder may not vote shares that he or she has already fully cumulated and voted in favor of a successful candidate. On all other questions, each
	common shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by him or her.


	Nominations for election to the board of
	directors may be made by the board of directors or by any stockholder of any outstanding class of capital stock of the association entitled to vote for election of directors. Nominations other than those made by or on behalf of the existing
	management shall be made in writing and be delivered or mailed to the president of the association not less than 14 days nor more than 50 days prior to any meeting of shareholders called for the election of directors; provided, however, that if less
	than 21 days notice of the meeting is given to shareholders, such nominations shall be mailed or delivered to the president of the association not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of meeting
	was mailed. Such notification shall contain the following information to the extent known to the notifying shareholder:


	 




	 


	1)


	The name and address of each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	2)


	The principal occupation of each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	3)


	The total number of shares of capital stock of the association that will be voted for each proposed nominee.




	 




	 


	4)


	The name and residence address of the notifying shareholder.




	 




	 


	5)


	The number of shares of capital stock of the association owned by the notifying shareholder.




	Nominations not made in accordance herewith may, in his/her discretion, be disregarded by the chairperson of the meeting, and the vote tellers
	may disregard all votes cast for each such nominee. No bylaw may unreasonably restrict the nomination of directors by shareholders.


	A
	director may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the board of directors, its chairperson, or to the association, which resignation shall be effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date.


	A director may be removed by shareholders at a meeting called to remove the director, when notice of the meeting stating that the purpose
	or one of the purposes is to remove the director is provided, if there is a failure to fulfill one of the affirmative requirements for qualification, or for cause; provided, however, that a director may not be removed if the number of votes
	sufficient to elect the director under cumulative voting is voted against the directors removal.


	FIFTH. The authorized amount of capital stock of
	this association shall be ten thousand shares of common stock of the par value of one hundred dollars ($100) each; but said capital stock may be increased or decreased from time to time, according to the provisions of the laws of the United States.


	No holder of shares of the capital stock of any class of the association shall have any preemptive or preferential right of subscription
	to any shares of any class of stock of the association, whether now or hereafter authorized, or to any obligations convertible into stock of the association, issued, or sold, nor any right of subscription to any thereof other than such, if any, as
	the board of directors, in its discretion, may from time to time determine and at such price as the board of directors may from time to time fix. Preemptive rights also must be approved by a vote of holders of two-thirds of the banks
	outstanding voting shares. Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, (1) all matters requiring shareholder action, including amendments to the articles of association, must be approved by shareholders
	owning a majority voting interest in the outstanding voting stock, and (2) each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote per share.





	Unless otherwise specified in these articles of association or required by law, all shares of
	voting stock shall be voted together as a class, on any matters requiring shareholder approval. If a proposed amendment would affect two or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, all the classes or series so affected must
	vote together as a single voting group on the proposed amendment.


	Shares of one class or series may be issued as a dividend for shares of
	the same class or series on a pro rata basis and without consideration. Shares of one class or series may be issued as share dividends for a different class or series of stock if approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class
	or series to be issued, unless there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued. Unless otherwise provided by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend shall be the date
	authorized by the board of directors for the share dividend.


	Unless otherwise provided in the bylaws, the record date for determining
	shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting is the close of business on the day before the first notice is mailed or otherwise sent to the shareholders, provided that in no event may a record date be more than 70 days before the
	meeting.


	If a shareholder is entitled to fractional shares pursuant to a stock dividend, consolidation or merger, reverse stock split or
	otherwise, the association may: (a) issue fractional shares; (b) in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares, issue script or warrants entitling the holder to receive a full share upon surrendering enough script or warrants to equal a
	full share; (c) if there is an established and active market in the associations stock, make reasonable arrangements to provide the shareholder with an opportunity to realize a fair price through sale of the fraction, or purchase of the
	additional fraction required for a full share; (d) remit the cash equivalent of the fraction to the shareholder; or (e) sell full shares representing all the fractions at public auction or to the highest bidder after having solicited and
	received sealed bids from at least three licensed stock brokers; and distribute the proceeds pro rata to shareholders who otherwise would be entitled to the fractional shares. The holder of a fractional share is entitled to exercise the rights for
	shareholder, including the right to vote, to receive dividends, and to participate in the assets of the association upon liquidation, in proportion to the fractional interest. The holder of script or warrants is not entitled to any of these rights
	unless the script or warrants explicitly provide for such rights. The script or warrants may be subject to such additional conditions as: (1) that the script or warrants will become void if not exchanged for full shares before a specified date;
	and (2) that the shares for which the script or warrants are exchangeable may be sold at the option of the association and the proceeds paid to scriptholders.


	The association, at any time and from time to time, may authorize and issue debt obligations, whether or not subordinated, without the
	approval of the shareholders. Obligations classified as debt, whether or not subordinated, which may be issued by the association without the approval of shareholders, do not carry voting rights on any issue, including an increase or decrease in the
	aggregate number of the securities, or the exchange or reclassification of all or part of securities into securities of another class or series.


	SIXTH.
	The board of directors shall appoint one of its members president of this association, and one of its members chairperson of the board and shall have the power to appoint one or more vice presidents, a secretary who shall keep minutes of the
	directors and shareholders meetings and be responsible for authenticating the records of the association, and such other officers and employees as may be required to transact the business of this association.


	A duly appointed officer may appoint one or more officers or assistant officers if authorized by the board of directors in accordance with the
	bylaws.


	The board of directors shall have the power to:


	 




	 


	1)


	Define the duties of the officers, employees, and agents of the association.




	 




	 


	2)


	Delegate the performance of its duties, but not the responsibility for its duties, to the officers, employees, and agents of the association.




	 




	 


	3)


	Fix the compensation and enter into employment contracts with its officers and employees upon reasonable terms and conditions consistent with applicable law.









	 


	4)


	Dismiss officers and employees.




	 




	 


	5)


	Require bonds from officers and employees and to fix the penalty thereof.




	 




	 


	6)


	Ratify written policies authorized by the associations management or committees of the board.




	 




	 


	7)


	Regulate the manner in which any increase or decrease of the capital of the association shall be made, provided that nothing herein shall restrict the power of shareholders to increase or decrease the capital of the
	association in accordance with law, and nothing shall raise or lower from two-thirds the percentage required for shareholder approval to increase or reduce the capital.




	 




	 


	8)


	Manage and administer the business and affairs of the association.




	 




	 


	9)


	Adopt initial bylaws, not inconsistent with law or the articles of association, for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the association.




	 




	 


	10)


	Amend or repeal bylaws, except to the extent that the articles of association reserve this power in whole or in part to shareholders.




	 




	 


	11)


	Make contracts.




	 




	 


	12)


	Generally perform all acts that are legal for a board of directors to perform.




	SEVENTH. The board of
	directors shall have the power to change the location of the main office to any other place within the limits of Wilmington, Delaware, without the approval of the shareholders, or with a vote of shareholders owning two-thirds of the stock of such
	association for a relocation outside such limits and upon receipt of a certificate of approval from the Comptroller of the Currency, to any other location within or outside the limits of Wilmington Delaware, but not more than 30 miles beyond such
	limits. The board of directors shall have the power to establish or change the location of any branch or branches of the association to any other location permitted under applicable law, without approval of shareholders, subject to approval by the
	Comptroller of the Currency.


	EIGHTH. The corporate existence of this association shall continue until termination according to the laws of the United
	States.


	NINTH. The board of directors of this association, or any one or more shareholders owning, in the aggregate, not less than 50 percent of the
	stock of this association, may call a special meeting of shareholders at any time. Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws or the laws of the United States, a notice of the time, place, and purpose of every annual and special meeting of the
	shareholders shall be given at least 10 days prior to the meeting by first-class mail, unless the OCC determines that an emergency circumstance exists. If the association is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the sole shareholder may waive notice of the
	shareholders meeting. Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws or these articles, any action requiring approval of shareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting.


	TENTH. For purposes of this Article Tenth, the term institution-affiliated party shall mean any institution-affiliated party of the association as
	such term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(u).


	Any institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may be
	indemnified or reimbursed by the association for reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed actions or proceedings and appeals therein, whether civil, criminal, governmental, administrative or
	investigative, in accordance with and to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such law now or hereafter exists; provided, however, that when an administrative proceeding or action instituted by a federal banking agency results in a final order or
	settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist
	from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses advanced pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph and may not
	indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or





	other payments incurred. The association shall provide indemnification in connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her
	heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors.


	Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or
	proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not
	parties to such action or proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits, (b) a determination that the indemnified individual (or his or
	her heirs, executors or administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of expenses and fees by the association will not adversely affect the
	safety and soundness of the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event of a final order or
	settlement pursuant to which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist
	from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection
	with any action or proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) receipt of an undertaking by or
	on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) is
	ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these articles of association and (b) approval by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if
	such a quorum is not obtainable, then approval by stockholders. To the extent permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable
	standard of conduct provided by law for indemnification in connection with such action or proceeding.


	In the event that a majority of the
	members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request
	and provide the remaining members of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have
	been met, the remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	In the
	event that all of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request
	and provide the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Article Tenth have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may
	rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of
	indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these articles of association, (b) shall continue to exist after
	any restrictive amendment of these articles of association with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving
	rise to the action or proceeding, or on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association
	and the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.





	The rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of
	association shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled
	whether contained in these articles of association, the bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement providing such indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly
	authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise,
	of any such institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or allowed in his or her favor, against the association or otherwise, his or her costs and expenses
	incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.


	If this Article Tenth or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in
	any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Article Tenth shall remain fully enforceable.


	The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to indemnify its institution-affiliated
	parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these articles of association; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage to pay or reimburse any institution-affiliated party for the cost of any judgment or civil
	money penalty assessed against such person in an administrative proceeding or civil action commenced by any federal banking agency. Such insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all institution-affiliated parties.


	ELEVENTH. These articles of association may be amended at any regular or special meeting of the shareholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
	majority of the stock of this association, unless the vote of the holders of a greater amount of stock is required by law, and in that case by the vote of the holders of such greater amount. The associations board of directors may propose one
	or more amendments to the articles of association for submission to the shareholders.

	of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association, then the association shall require the repayment of all legal fees and expenses
	advanced pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph and may not indemnify such institution-affiliated parties (or their heirs, executors or administrators) for expenses, including expenses for legal fees, penalties or other payments incurred. The
	association shall provide indemnification in connection with an action or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) only if such action or proceeding (or part
	thereof) was authorized by the board of directors.


	Expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs,
	executors or administrators) in connection with any action or proceeding under 12 U.S.C. 164 or 1818 may be paid by the association in advance





	of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) a determination by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or
	proceeding that the institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) has a reasonable basis for prevailing on the merits, (b) a determination that the indemnified individual (or his or her heirs, executors or
	administrators) will have the financial capacity to reimburse the bank in the event he or she does not prevail, (c) a determination that the payment of expenses and fees by the association will not adversely affect the safety and soundness of
	the association, and (d) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event of a final order or settlement pursuant to
	which such person: (i) is assessed a civil money penalty, (ii) is removed from office or prohibited from participating in the conduct of the affairs of the association, or (iii) is required to cease and desist from or to take any
	affirmative action described in 12 U.S.C. 1818(b) with respect to the association. In all other instances, expenses incurred by an institution-affiliated party (or by his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in connection with any action or
	proceeding as to which indemnification may be given under these articles of association may be paid by the association in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon (a) receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
	institution-affiliated party (or by or on behalf of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) to repay such advancement in the event that such institution-affiliated party (or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) is ultimately found
	not to be entitled to indemnification as authorized by these bylaws and (b) approval by the board of directors acting by a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such action or proceeding or, if such a quorum is not obtainable,
	then approval by stockholders. To the extent permitted by law, the board of directors or, if applicable, the stockholders, shall not be required to find that the institution-affiliated party has met the applicable standard of conduct provided by law
	for indemnification in connection with such action or proceeding.


	In the event that a majority of the members of the board of directors
	are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the remaining members of the board may authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the remaining members
	of the board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If independent legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the
	remaining members of the board of directors may rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	In the event that all
	of the members of the board of directors are named as respondents in an administrative proceeding or civil action and request indemnification, the board shall authorize independent legal counsel to review the indemnification request and provide the
	board with a written opinion of counsel as to whether the conditions delineated in the first four paragraphs of this Section 5 of Article VIII have been met. If legal counsel opines that said conditions have been met, the board of directors may
	rely on such opinion in authorizing the requested indemnification.


	To the extent permitted under applicable law, the rights of
	indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these articles of association (a) shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption of these bylaws, (b) shall continue to exist after any restrictive
	amendment of these bylaws with respect to events occurring prior to such amendment, (c) may be interpreted on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time of the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the action or proceeding, or
	on the basis of applicable law in effect at the time such rights are claimed, and (d) are in the nature of contract rights which may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction as if the association and the institution-affiliated party
	(or his or her heirs, executors or administrators) for whom such rights are sought were parties to a separate written agreement.


	The
	rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall not, to the extent permitted under applicable law, be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such institution-affiliated party (or his or her
	heirs, executors or administrators) may now or hereafter be otherwise entitled whether contained in the associations articles of association, these bylaws, a resolution of stockholders, a resolution of the board of directors, or an agreement
	providing such indemnification, the creation of such other rights being hereby expressly authorized. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the rights of indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided in these bylaws shall
	not be deemed exclusive of





	any rights, pursuant to statute or otherwise, of any such institution-affiliated party (or of his or her heirs, executors or administrators) in any such action or proceeding to have assessed or
	allowed in his or her favor, against the association or otherwise, his or her costs and expenses incurred therein or in connection therewith or any part thereof.


	If this Section 5 of Article VIII or any part hereof shall be held unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, it
	shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remainder of this Section 5 of Article VIII shall remain fully enforceable.


	The association may, upon affirmative vote of a majority of its board of directors, purchase insurance to indemnify its institution-affiliated
	parties to the extent that such indemnification is allowed in these bylaws; provided, however, that no such insurance shall include coverage for a final order assessing civil money penalties against such persons by a bank regulatory agency. Such
	insurance may, but need not, be for the benefit of all institution-affiliated parties.



	ARTICLE IX





	Inspection and Amendments





	Section 1. Inspection

	. A copy of the bylaws of the association, with all amendments, shall at all times be kept in a convenient
	place at the main office of the association, and shall be open for inspection to all shareholders during banking hours.



	Section 2. Amendments

	. The bylaws of the association may be amended, altered or repealed, at any regular meeting of the board of
	directors, by a vote of a majority of the total number of the directors except as provided below, and provided that the following language accompany any such change.

on current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections and include comments that express current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words such as believe,
anticipate, estimate, intend, could, plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of assumptions concerning future

performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although the issuers believe that their plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements


 
volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans, all of which could increase costs
and could limit our ability to acquire additional real estate assets;   


 

 
continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;   


 

 
the issuers leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;   


 

 
an increase in the issuers debt service obligations;   


 

 
the issuers ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash from operations to satisfy working capital requirements and to service their existing and future indebtedness; 
 


 

 
the issuers ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;   


 

 
foreign currency fluctuations;   


 

 
adverse changes in the securities markets;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain their senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;   


 

 
trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers;   


 

 
changes in tax laws in the United States, Europe or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits the issuers receive; 
 


 

 
future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and   


 

 
costs relating to the acquisition of assets the issuers may acquire could be higher than anticipated.

 The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges, as
defined. For this purpose, earnings consist of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of joint ventures plus operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed
charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. For the year ended December 31,
2011, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $6.5 million. 
The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed
charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings and fixed charges have the respective meanings assigned above. Preferred stock dividends refers to preferred dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, and the deficiency of earnings was $15.3 million.

Table of Contents
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of October 30, 2016, 113,318,152 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock have exclusive voting rights for the
election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of any
outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders and also are
entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the common stock will be subject to (i) the
prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, and (ii) compliance with any applicable limitation in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement. Our
common stock has no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors
being elected in each year. A plurality of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting is sufficient to elect any director into office. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors.

certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or preferred stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be
issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, the designations, powers, and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications,
limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series of preferred stock. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting
power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
change of control or the removal of existing management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of the company or remove existing management. As of October 30, 2016, 32,550 shares of our series B
preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Other than the series B preferred stock, no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding.

forth below and the description of the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the articles
supplementary relating to that class or series.  The preferences and other terms of the preferred stock of each class or series will be
fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement, relating to each class or series, will specify the terms of the preferred stock as follows:

the title and stated value of such preferred stock;   


 

 
the number of shares of such preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of such preferred stock;


 
the relative ranking and preferences of such preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our company;

convertible into our common stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto. Such terms will include the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of preferred stock are convertible, the conversion
price (or manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion price and
provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock.  Power to Increase
Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Preferred Stock. The number of authorized shares of preferred stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is
required pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the board of directors for such series. Our board of directors has the power to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of
our preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. Although our board of directors does not intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms
of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest. 
Dividend Limitations. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the preferred stock will be subject to compliance with any
applicable limitations in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement.  6.452%
Convertible Series B Preferred Stock  General. Our board of directors and a duly authorized committee thereof approved
the certificate of designation, a copy of which we have previously filed with the SEC and which we incorporate by reference as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, creating the series B preferred stock as a
class of our preferred stock, designated as the 6.452% convertible series B preferred stock. The outstanding series B preferred stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
Ranking. The series B preferred stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up:   


 

 
senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the series B preferred stock; 
 


 

 
on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock; and 
  13


 
junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the series B preferred stock. 
Dividend Rate and Payment Date. Investors are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends on the series B preferred stock from
and including the date of original issue, payable quarterly in arrears on or about the last calendar day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing September 30, 2010, at the rate of 6.452% per annum of the $1,000.00 liquidation
preference per share. Dividends on the series B preferred stock will accrue whether or not we have earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends. Our debt agreements, including debt securities issued
pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus supplement, may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends on our preferred stock. 
Liquidation Preference. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up, holders of the series B preferred stock will have the right to
receive $1,000.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) up to and including the date of payment, before any payment is made to holders of our common stock and any other class or series of stock ranking
junior to the series B preferred stock as to liquidation rights. The rights of holders of series B preferred stock to receive their liquidation preference will be subject to the proportionate rights of any other class or series of our stock ranking
on parity with the series B preferred stock as to liquidation.  Optional Conversion and Mandatory Conversion. Prior to
November 3, 2018, each share of series B preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 103 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, or the series B conversion rate.
At any time on or after May 3, 2017 and prior to November 3, 2018, we have the option to convert all or part of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock into shares of common stock at the series B conversion rate. On November 3, 2018, each
outstanding share of series B preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at the series B conversion rate. 
Voting Rights. Holders of series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights. However, if we are in arrears on dividends
on the series B preferred stock for three or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the series B preferred stock (voting together as a class with the holders of all other classes or series of parity preferred stock upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote at our next annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders for the election of two additional directors to serve on our board of directors until all unpaid
dividends and the dividend for the then-current period with respect to the series B preferred stock and any other class or series of parity preferred stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set aside for
payment. In addition, we may not make certain material and adverse changes to the terms of the series B preferred stock without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock and the
holders of all other shares of any class or series ranking on parity with the series B preferred stock that are entitled to similar voting rights (voting together as a single class). 
Transfer Agent and Registrar. The transfer agent and registrar for our series B preferred stock is Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company.

governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange may be required.  You may effect the transfer of certificated debt

Any restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of new debt securities will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.

holders of new debt securities.  Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets

Table of Contents


 

 
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing. 
Notwithstanding the above, any subsidiaries of the applicable issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties to the applicable issuer.  Events of Default 
Event of Default means, with respect to any series of new debt securities, any of the following: 
 


 

 
a default in the payment of any interest upon any new debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is
deposited by the applicable issuer with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);   


 

 
a default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;   


 

 
a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if, when and as due by the terms of the new debt securities of that series, and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; 
 


 

 
a default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by the applicable issuer (or, in the case the new debt securities of that series are subject to a guarantee, the guarantor of such guarantee) in
the applicable base indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the applicable base indenture solely for the benefit of a series of new debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period
of 60 days after the applicable issuer receives written notice from the trustee or the applicable issuer and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that
series as provided in the applicable base indenture;   


 

 
if the new debt securities of such series are subject to a guarantee of a guarantor, such guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by such guarantor or the applicable
issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by the applicable base indenture or the terms of the new debt securities of that series; 
 


 

 
certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the applicable issuer; and   


 

 
any other Event of Default provided with respect to new debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of new debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of new debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the applicable base indenture may constitute an event of
default under certain other indebtedness of the applicable issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.  If an Event of
Default with respect to new debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series may, by a
notice in writing to the applicable issuer (and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the new debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal
amount as may be specified in the terms of that series), and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all new debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding new debt securities of the 
  21 


Table of Contents

applicable series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding new debt securities. At any time
after a declaration of acceleration with respect to new debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding new debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium and interest, if any, with respect to new debt securities of that series)
have been cured or waived as provided in the applicable base indenture. You are referred to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of new debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration
of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The applicable base
indenture will provide that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable base indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which
might be incurred by it in exercising such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the new debt securities of that series. 
No holder of any new debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
applicable base indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the applicable base indenture, unless:   


 

 
that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to new debt securities of that series; and 
 


 

 
the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the
proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has (x) not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and (y) failed to institute
the proceeding within 60 days.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the applicable base indenture, the holder of any new
debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that new debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that new debt security and to institute suit for the
enforcement of payment.  The applicable base indenture will require the applicable issuer to, within 120 days after the end of its fiscal
year, furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the applicable base indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and is known to a responsible officer of the
trustee, then the trustee must mail to each holder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The applicable base indenture will provide that the trustee may withhold notice to the
holders of new debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any new debt securities of that series) with respect to new debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding
notice is in the interest of the holders of those new debt securities.  Modification and Waiver 
The applicable issuer, the applicable guarantors, if any, and the trustee may modify and amend the applicable base indenture or the new debt
securities of any series without the consent of any holder of any new debt security:   


 

 
to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;


 
to secure or provide additional security for all or any new debt securities of any series;

Defeasance of New Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances
 Legal Defeasance. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, the applicable issuer and the guarantors, if any, will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding new debt securities of any series on the 123rd day after the date
of the deposit referred to below, and the provisions of the applicable base indenture, as it relates to such outstanding new debt securities of such series, will no longer be in effect, except as to certain specified rights, powers, immunities and
provisions. In order to effect such legal defeasance, the following conditions, among others, must be satisfied:   


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the applicable base indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the applicable issuer is a party or by which it is
bound;   


 

 
no default or Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 123rd day after such date; and
  


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the applicable issuer or guarantor(s), as applicable, have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the applicable base indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred. 
Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:   


 

 
the applicable issuer and, if applicable, may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other covenants set forth in the applicable
base indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement; and   


 

 
any omission to comply with those covenants, or with certain other Events of Default, will not constitute a default or an Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of that series (covenant
defeasance).  The conditions include the following, among others: 
 


 

 
 subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if
applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency

  25 


Table of Contents


 
 
other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their
terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, premium and interest on and any mandatory
sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt securities; and 
 


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related
covenant defeasance had not occurred.  Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default. In the event the
applicable issuer exercises its option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of new debt securities, and the new debt securities of that series are declared due and payable immediately following an acceleration after the
occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money or U.S. government obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of their
stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of such acceleration. However, the applicable issuer shall remain liable for those payments. 
Governing Law  The
applicable base indenture and the new debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the applicable base indenture or the securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The issuers may sell the securities domestically or abroad to one or more underwriters for public offering and sale by them or may sell the
securities to investors directly or through dealers or agents, or through a combination of methods. Any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of the securities will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Underwriters may offer and sell the securities at: (i) a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, (ii) market prices prevailing at
the time of sale, (iii) prices related to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale or (iv) negotiated prices. The issuers also may, from time to time, authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and sell the securities upon the
terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from the applicable issuer in the form of underwriting discounts or
commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or
commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.  Any underwriting compensation
paid by an issuer to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers, will be set forth in the applicable prospectus
supplement. Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be
underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with any of the issuers, to indemnification against and contribution toward civil liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. Any indemnification agreement will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.  Unless
specified otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any series of securities issued hereunder will be a new issue with no established trading market (other than Kennedy-Wilson Holdings common stock, which is listed on the
NYSE). If Kennedy-Wilson Holdings sells any shares of its common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement, such shares will be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The issuers may elect to list any other securities
issued hereunder on any exchange, but the issuers are not obligated to do so. Any underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold for public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents
will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for any such securities. 
If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the issuers may authorize underwriters or other persons acting as the issuers
agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the issuers at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and
delivery on the date or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions.
Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which
the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts. 
To facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than the issuers sold to them. In these
circumstances, these persons would cover the over-allotments or 
  28 


Table of Contents

short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding
for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. 
The underwriters, dealers and agents and their affiliates may be customers of, engage in transactions with and perform services for the
issuers in the ordinary course of business.  The specific plan of distribution, including any underwriters, dealers, agents or direct
purchasers and their compensation, will be identified in a prospectus supplement.

Item 15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. 
Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides as follows: 
SEVENTH.  1. Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other
than by or in the Right of the Corporation.  The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed
to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an Indemnitee), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good
faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Article, except as set forth in Section 6 below, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was
approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  2. Actions of Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation. 
The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer of the Corporation,

  32 


Table of Contents

or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement
actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of
the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of
Delaware or the court in which such action of suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses (including attorneys fees) which the Court of Chancery of Delaware of such other court shall deem proper.  3.
Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that an Indemnitee
has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections I and 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such action, suit or
proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any action, suit or proceeding is disposed
of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal
proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purpose hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto. 
4. Notification and Defense of Claim.  As a
condition precedent to his right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving him for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect
to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnitee in connection with such claim, other than as provided below in this Section 4. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel in connection with such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have
reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed
counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Article. The Corporation shall not be
entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above.
 5. Advance of Expenses.  Subject to the
provisions of Section 6 below, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 4 of this Article of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under this Article, any
expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in 
  33 


Table of Contents

defending a civil or criminal action, suit, proceeding or investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such matter, provided,
however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event
that it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such undertaking may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make such
repayment.  6. Procedure for Indemnification. 
In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section 1, 2, 3 or 5 of this Article, the Indemnitee shall submit to
the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to
requests under Section 1, 2 or 5 the Corporation determines, by clear and convincing evidence, within such 60-day period that the Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2, as the case may be. Such
determination shall be made in each instance by (i) a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question (disinterested directors), even though less than a
quorum, (ii) if there are no such disinterested directors, or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, (iii) a majority vote of a quorum of
the outstanding shares of stock of all classes entitled to vote for directors, voting as a single class, which quorum shall consist of stockholders who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question, or (iv) the Delaware
Court of Chancery.  7. Remedies.  The right
to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the
60-day period referred to above in Section 6. Unless otherwise provided by law, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by
the Corporation pursuant to Section 6 that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The
Indemnitees expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. 
8. Subsequent Amendment.  No amendment,
termination or repeal of this Article or of the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws shall affect or diminish in any way the rights of any Indemnitee to indemnification under the
provisions hereof with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such amendment, termination or repeal. 
9. Other Rights.  The indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, 
  34 


Table of Contents

both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in any other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director
or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article shall be deemed to prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into, agreements
with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and procedures different from those set forth in this Article. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time (0 time by its Board of Directors, grant indemnification
rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article. 
10. Partial Indemnification.  If an Indemnitee
is entitled under any provision of this Article to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or
on his behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.  11. Insurance. 
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense, liability or loss incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
12. Merger or Consolidation.  If the
Corporation is merged into or consolidated with another corporation and the Corporation is not the surviving corporation, the surviving corporation shall assume the obligations of the Corporation under this Article with respect to any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the date of such merger or consolidation. 
13. Savings Clause.  If this Article or any
portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by an applicable portion of this
Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  14. Definitions. 
Terms used herein and defined in Section l45(h) and Section l45(i) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in such Section l45(h) and Section l45(i).  15. Subsequent Legislation. 
If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended after adoption of this Article to expand further the indemnification
permitted to Indemnitees, then the Corporation shall indemnify such persons to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended.

Kennedy-Wilson, Inc.s Amended and Restated By-Laws provides as follows: 
Article VII.Indemnification. 
7.1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a Proceeding), by reason of being or having been a director or officer of the Corporation or serving or having served at the request of the Corporation
as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an Indemnitee), whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action or failure to act in an official capacity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware GCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto) (as used in this Article 7, the Delaware Law), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in §7.2 hereof with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
Indemnitee in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article 7
shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an Advancement of Expenses);
provided, however, that, if the Delaware Law so requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an Undertaking), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a Final Adjudication) that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses
under this Article 7 or otherwise.  7.2. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under §7.1 hereof is not paid in full by the
Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the Indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an
Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee
to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware Law,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has
not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder,
or by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, under this Article 7 or otherwise
shall be on the Corporation.

conferred in this Article 7 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.  7.4. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under this Article 7 or under the Delaware Law.  7.5. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the Advancement of Expenses, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article 7 with respect to the indemnification and Advancement of Expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action
further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
paragraph (A) by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 
B. The Corporation, to the full extent permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it
may indemnify pursuant thereto. Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be

consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or  (b) If such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if

standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be

not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
Section 6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. 
The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the

a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of

conduct was unlawful.  (c) This Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any

expenses and then only to the extent that the court shall determine; (2) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or (3) Of expenses incurred in defending a pending action which is settled or
otherwise disposed of without court approval.  (d) To the extent that an agent of this Corporation has been successful on the merits in
defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivisions (b) or (c) of this Section 16, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection
therewith.  (e) Except as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or in subdivision (d) of this Section 16, any indemnification under
this Section shall be made by this Corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification. of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
subdivisions (b) or ( c) of this Section 16; by any of the following: (1) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding; (2) If such a quorum of directors is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion; (3) Approval or ratification by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of this Corporation entitled to vote represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present or by written consent of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. For such purpose, the shares owned by the person to be indemnified shall not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote thereon; or (4) The court in which such proceeding is or was pending,
upon application made by this Corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or person is opposed by this Corporation. 
(f) This Corporation may advance expenses incurred by an agent in defending any proceeding prior to the final disposition of such proceeding

inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the person. Nothing contained in this Section 16 shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than directors and officers of this Corporation or any subsidiary

(h) No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Section 16, except as provided in
subdivisions (d) or (e)(3) of this Section 16, in any circumstance where it appears: (1) That it would be inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation, a resolution of the stockholders, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of
the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (2) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by

The subsidiary guarantors that are California corporations are subject to the provisions of the California Corporations Code (the
CCC). Section 317 of the CCC authorizes a corporation to indemnify a person who is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any suit (other than a suit by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person
is or was the corporations director or officer, or is or was serving at the corporations request as a director or officer of another entity, for expenses (including attorneys fees) and other liabilities actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with any such suit, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to criminal actions, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Section 317 provides further that a corporation may indemnify a director or officer for expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense or settlement
of a suit by or in the right of the corporation, provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. To the extent a corporations director or officer
is successful on the merits in the defense of any such suit, that person shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred. Under Section 317 of the CCC, expenses incurred in defending any suit may be advanced by the corporation
prior to the final disposition of the proceeding upon receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay that amount if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

against.

 The Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Capital provides as follows: 
ARTICLE VI. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS. 
Section 1. AGENTS, PROCEEDINGS, AND EXPENSES. For the purposes of this Article, agent means any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee, or other agent of this corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of this corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise, or who was a director, officer, employee, or agent of a foreign or domestic corporation that was a predecessor corporation of this corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation;
proceeding means any threatened, pending, or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative; and expenses includes, without limitation, attorney fees and any expenses of establishing
a right to indemnification under Section 4 or Section 5( d) of this Article VI.  Section 2. ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY THE CORPORATION. This
corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the
fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if that person acted in good faith and in a manner
that the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of that person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by judgment,
order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not, of itself, create a presumption either that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that the person reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of this corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was not unlawful.  Section
3. ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. This corporation will have the power to indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this
corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of that
action, if such person acted in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this corporation and its shareholders. No indemnification will be made under this Section 3 for the following: 
(a) Any claim, issue, or matter on which such person has been adjudged to be liable to this corporation in the performance of such
persons duty to the corporation and its shareholders, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending will determine on application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses, and then only to the extent that the court will determine;  (b) Amounts paid m
settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or  (c) Expenses incurred in defending a pending action that
is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.  Section 4. SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE BY AGENT. To the extent that an agent of this
corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in Sections 2 or 3 of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent will be indemnified against expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.  Section 5. REQUIRED APPROVAL. Except as provided in Section 4 of this Article
VI, any indemnification under this section will be made by the corporation only if authorized in the specific case, after a 
  52 


Table of Contents

determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 by one of the following:
 (a) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are not parties to such proceeding; 
(b) Independent legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of directors who are not parties to such a proceeding is not available. 
(c) (i) The affirmative vote of a majority of shares of this corporation entitled to vote represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum
is present; or  (ii) the written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote (for purposes of this
subsection 5(c), the shares owned by the person to be indemnified will not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote thereon); or  (d)
The court in which the proceeding is or was pending, on application made by this corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by the agent, attorney, or
other person is opposed by this corporation.  Section 6. ADVANCE OF EXPENSES. Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be
advanced by the corporation before the final disposition of such proceeding on receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amounts if it will be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Article VI.  Section 7. OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS. The indemnification provided by this Article VI will not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under, e.g., any bylaw, agreement, or vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, both regarding action in an official capacity and regarding action in another
capacity while holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the articles of the corporation. Nothing in this section will affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such
directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.  Section 8. LIMITATIONS. No indemnification or advance will be made under
this Article VI, except as provided in Section 4 or Section 5(d), in any circumstance if it appears:  (a) That it would be inconsistent
with a provision of the articles or bylaws, a resolution of the shareholders, or an agreement which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving
settlement.  Section 9. INSURANCE. This corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation insuring
against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in that capacity or arising out of the agents status as such, whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against that liability under the
provisions of this Article VI. Despite the foregoing, if this corporation owns all or a portion of the shares of the company issuing the policy of insurance, the insuring company or the policy will meet the conditions set forth in Corporations Code
§317(i).  Section 10. FIDUCIARIES OF CORPORATE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN. This Article VI does not apply to any proceeding against any
trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in that persons capacity as such, even though that person may also be an agent of the corporation. The corporation will have the power, to the extent permitted by
Corporations Code §207(f), to indemnify, and to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such trustee, investment manager, or other fiduciary of any benefit plan for any or all of the directors, officers, and employees of the
corporation or any of its subsidiary or affiliated corporations. 
  53 


Table of Contents
Section 11. SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS. The rights provided by this Article VI will continue for a person
who has ceased to be an agent and will inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.  Section 12.
EFFECT OF AMENDMENT. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of this Article VI will not adversely affect an agents right or protection existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, or modification. 
Section 13. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS. The corporation will not be liable to indemnify any agent under this Article VI for (a) any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporations written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or (b) any judicial award, if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely opportunity
to participate, at its expense, in the defense of such action.  Section 14. SUBROGATION. In the event of payment under this Article
VI, the corporation will be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of recovery of the agent, who will execute all papers required and will do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of
such documents as may be necessary to enable the corporation effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.  Section 15. NO DUPLICATION
OF PAYMENTS. The corporation will not be liable under this Article VI to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the agent to the extent the agent has otherwise actually received payment, whether under a policy of insurance, an
agreement, or a vote, or through other means, of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable under this Article.  California Limited Liability Company
Subsidiary Guarantors  The subsidiary guarantors that are California limited liability companies are subject to the provisions of
the California Limited Liability Company Act. Under Section 17153 of the California Limited Liability Company Act, except for a breach of duty, the articles of organization or written operating agreement of a limited liability company may provide
for indemnification of any person, including, without limitation, any manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company, against judgments, settlements, penalties, fines or expenses of any kind incurred as a result of
acting in that capacity. A limited liability company shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company against any liability asserted against on
incurred by the person in that capacity or arising out of the persons status as a manager, member, officer, employee or agent of the limited liability company. 
The Operating Agreement of Kennedy Wilson Fund Management Group, LLC provides as follows: 
4.5 Indemnification of Member. 
Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or
otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, and the Member shall not be obligated for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company by reason of being a member of the Company. The Company shall fully
indemnify the Member for any claim against the Member in the Members capacity as a member or a manager.  The Limited Liability
Company Agreement of KW Loan Partners II LLC provides as follows:  The Company shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless
each officer from any claim, damage, loss or liability which he or she may suffer which arises from or relates to the performance or nonperformance of the duties assigned to him or her by the Member, as applicable. Any individual may hold any number
of offices.  Illinois Corporate Subsidiary Guarantor 
The subsidiary guarantor that is an Illinois corporation is subject to the provisions of the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1983, as
amended (the IBCA). Under Section 8.75 of the IBCA, an Illinois corporation may

Table of Contents

indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.  In addition, an Illinois corporation may
indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in,
or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, provided that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to have been liable to the corporation, unless, and only
to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses as the court shall deem proper.  Section 8.75 of the IBCA also provides that, to the extent that a present or
former director, officer or employee of a corporation has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in either of the foregoing paragraphs, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter
therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith, if the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to
be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation.  The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Kennedy-Wilson Properties,
Ltd. are silent with respect to indemnification.  SEC Position on Indemnification for Securities Act Liabilities 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons
pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrants have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

 Item 17. Undertakings 
(A) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:   


 
1)
To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:   


 
i.
To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;   


 
ii.
To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a
fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement; and 
  59 


Table of Contents


 
iii.
To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;
 provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) shall not apply if the information required to
be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC by the registrants pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by
reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.   


 
2)
That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and
the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof; and   


 
3)
To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering. 
 


 
4)
That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:   


 
i.
Each prospectus filed by the registrants pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
statement; and   


 
ii.
Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5), or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii), or (x)
for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after
effectiveness or the date of the first contract or sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus. As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be
deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which that prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement
or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract or sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part
of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.   


 
5)
That, for the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: 
Each undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of such undersigned registrant pursuant to this
registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, such undersigned registrant will be
a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:   


 
i.
Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of such undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; 
 


 
ii.
Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; 
  60 


Table of Contents


 
iii.
The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about such undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of such undersigned registrant; and
  


 
iv.
Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by such undersigned registrant to the purchaser. 
(B) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of a
registrants annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plans annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof.  (C) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to
directors, officers and controlling persons of any registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, each registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by any registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
or controlling person of any registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, such registrant will, unless in the
opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.  (D) Each undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of
determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act (Act) in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under section 305(b)(2) of the Act.

PROSPECTUS    SUPPLEMENT  (To
Prospectus Dated November 1, 2013)  $300,000,000   


 Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. 
5.875% Senior Notes due 2024   
  The Company 
Kennedy Wilson is a vertically integrated global real estate investment and services company with over $14.8 billion in assets under management.
Founded in 1977, we have owned and operated real estate related investments for over 35 years on behalf of our shareholders and our clients. We have approximately 400 employees in 24 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Spain and Japan and manage and work with over 2,000 operating associates. We focus on adding value for our shareholders through opportunistic investing and strategic asset management. Also, our services business creates additional value through fee
generation.  The Notes   



 
Issuer: The notes will be issued by Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., whom we refer to as Kennedy-Wilson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc., whom we refer to as Kennedy-Wilson Holdings. 
 



 
Maturity: The notes will mature on April 1, 2024.   



 
Interest Payments: The notes will pay cash interest, semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2014. 
 



 
Guarantees: The notes will be guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings and, subject to certain exceptions, its material existing and future domestic subsidiaries. 
 



 
Ranking: The notes and the guarantees will be senior unsecured obligations. They will rank equally in right of payment with existing and future senior indebtedness of Kennedy-Wilson and the guarantors and senior in
right of payment to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness of Kennedy-Wilson and the guarantors. The notes will be effectively subordinated to all of Kennedy-Wilsons and the guarantors secured debt to the extent of the value
of the assets securing that debt and structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Kennedy-Wilsons subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. 
 



 
Optional Redemption: At any time prior to April 1, 2019, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable
make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, as described in this prospectus supplement. At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2019, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the notes, in
whole or in part, at the redemption prices specified under Description of the NotesOptional Redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Prior to April 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem up to
35% of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings. There is no sinking fund for the notes.  Use of Proceeds 
The net proceeds from the sale of the notes are currently intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and
co-investments, and to repay Kennedy-Wilsons outstanding balance under its unsecured revolving credit facility.  Investing in the
notes involves a high degree of risk. Before buying any notes, you should read the material risks of investing in the notes included or referred to under the heading Risk Factors beginning on page S-17 of
this prospectus supplement. The notes are expected to be rated below investment grade and are subject to the risks associated with non-investment grade securities. 
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed
upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

will be the 4th business day following the date of this prospectus supplement (such settlement being referred to as T+4). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), trades in
the secondary market are required, subject to certain exceptions, to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to sell their notes before the third business day
prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+4, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Those
purchasers should consult their advisors.  Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this prospectus
supplement, the words we, us, our or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY 
This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere, or incorporated by reference, in this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus and may not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should carefully read this together with the entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, and the documents incorporated by
reference, including the Risk Factors section, the historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements. 
Our Company  We are a
vertically integrated global real estate investment and services company with over $14.8 billion in assets under management (AUM). Founded in 1977, we have owned and operated real estate-related investments for over 35 years on
behalf of our shareholders and our clients. We have approximately 400 employees in 24 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Japan and manage and work with over 2,000 operating associates. We focus on
adding value for our shareholders through opportunistic investing and strategic asset management. Also, our services business creates additional value through fee generation. 
AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management
services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. Our AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market and is not the basis for
determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate-related assets either owned by third parties, wholly owned by us or held by joint ventures and
other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our AUM. The estimated value of development properties is
included at estimated completion cost.  Our operating associates generally are individuals that are employed by or affiliated with
third-party consultants, contractors, property managers or other service providers that we manage and oversee on a day-to-day basis with respect to our investments and services businesses. 
Our Business Segments 
Our operations are defined by two core business units: KW Investments and KW Services. KW Investments invests our capital in most cases
alongside partners capital in real estate-related assets, including multifamily properties, loans secured by real estate and commercial properties. KW Services provides a full array of real estate-related services to investors and lenders,
with a strong focus on financial institution based clients.  KW Investments 
We invest our capital in real estate assets and loans secured by real estate either on our own or with strategic partners through joint
ventures, separate accounts and funds. We are typically the general partner in these investment vehicles with ownership interests ranging from approximately 5% to 50% and often have the right to promoted interests in the profits of the investments.
Our equity partners include financial institutions, foundations, endowments, high net worth individuals and other institutional investors. 
The following are product types we invest in through the KW Investments segment: 
Commercial  We source, acquire, and
finance various types of commercial real estate, which includes office, industrial, retail, and mixed-use assets. After acquisition, the properties are repositioned to enhance market value.

Assets are either sold as part of property-specific investment strategies designed to deliver above-market returns to our clients and shareholders or held if producing above average returns. As
of December 31, 2013, we owned interests in 85 commercial properties, totaling over 10 million square feet, located throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Japan. 
Multifamily  We pursue multifamily
acquisition opportunities where we believe we can unlock value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartments in
supply-constrained, infill markets. As of December 31, 2013, we held investments in 17,355 multifamily apartment units, of which 2,327 units are owned by our consolidated subsidiaries and 15,028 units are owned through joint ventures. 
Loan Originations/Discounted Loan Purchases 
We acquire and/or originate loans secured by real estate. Our acquisitions and originations include individual notes on all real estate
property types as well as portfolios of loans purchased from financial institutions, corporations and government agencies. We deliver value through loan resolutions, discounted payoffs and sales. We also foreclose on certain loans to acquire the
underlying real estate collateral. The loans in our discounted purchased loan pool portfolio as of December 31, 2013 had an initial unpaid principal balance, or UPB, of $4.7 billion at the time of their origination. As of December 31,
2013, the UPB was $1.0 billion due to collections of over $3 billion on the portfolio. Also, as of December 31, 2013, our loan originations portfolio had an UPB of $57.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 10.1%. 
Residential, Hotel and Other  In certain
cases, we may pursue residential for sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill condominium sites and partially finished and finished condominium projects. We also invest in hotels and
marketable securities.  While our core investments have been in the specific markets and locations listed above, we continue to evaluate
opportunities to earn above market returns across many other segments and geographic locations.

Includes for-sale residential properties, condominiums and residential land.  KW Services
 KW Services offers a comprehensive line of real estate services for the full lifecycle of real estate ownership and investment to
clients that include financial institutions, developers, builders and government agencies. KW Services has five business lines: investment management, property services, research, brokerage and auction and conventional sales. These five business
lines generate revenue for us through commissions and fees.  We manage over 68 million square feet of properties for institutional
clients and individual investors in the United States, Europe and Asia, which includes assets we have ownership interests in and third party-owned assets. With 24 offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Japan, we
have the capabilities and resources to provide property services to real estate owners as well as the experience, as a real estate investor, to understand client concerns. The managers of KW Services have an extensive track record in their
respective lines of business and in the real estate community as a whole. Their knowledge and relationships are an excellent driver of businesses through the services business as well as on the investment front.

Table of Contents

Additionally, KW Services plays a critical role in supporting the companys investment
strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies. 
Investment Management  Our investment
management division provides acquisition, asset management and disposition services to our equity partners as well as to third parties. Our fund management division has invested in real estate deals totaling $3 billion since its inception in
2000. Today, through six closed-end funds (two traditional funds, two club funds and two double bottom line funds), we serve as general partner and manager of an estimated $2 billion in value of real estate, 10.6 million square feet of office
and retail space and over 7,200 apartment units.  Property Services 
Our property services division manages commercial real estate for third-party clients, fund investors and investments held by Kennedy Wilson.
In addition to earning property management fees, consulting fees, leasing commissions, construction management fees, disposition fees and accounting fees, the property services division gives Kennedy Wilson insight into local markets and potential
acquisitions. Leveraging over 35 years of real estate experience, we approach property management from the perspective of an owner and are active in identifying and implementing value-creation strategies. The division has a proven track record of
success in managing stabilized as well as value-add investments.  Research 
Meyers Research LLC, or Meyers, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kennedy Wilson, is a premier consulting practice and provider of data for
residential real estate development and new home construction. Meyers offers a national perspective as well as local expertise to homebuilders, multifamily developers, lenders and financial institutions. These relationships have led to
investment opportunities with homebuilders in the Western United States region.  Brokerage 
Our brokerage division represents tenants and landlords in every aspect of site selection, negotiation and occupancy. The division also
specializes in innovative marketing programs tailored to client objectives for all types of investment grade and income-producing real estate. The divisions property marketing programs combine proven techniques with its detailed market
knowledge to create optimum results.  Auction and Conventional Sales 
The auction and conventional sales division provides innovative marketing and sales strategies for all types of commercial and residential
real estate, including single family homes, mixed-use developments, estate homes, multifamily dwellings, new home projects and conversions. Generally the divisions auction sales business is countercyclical to the traditional sales real estate
market.  Value Creation 
Our differentiated approach to investing is the cornerstone of how we create value for our shareholders. Our investment philosophy is based on
three core fundamentals:   


 

 
Leverage our global footprint and complementary investments and services businesses to identify attractive investment markets across the world. 
 
  S-5 


Table of Contents



 

 
Selectively invest in opportunities across many real estate product types with a goal of maximizing cash flow and return on capital. 
 


 

 
Actively manage assets and finance them conservatively to generate stable, predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients. 
We are able to create value for our shareholders in the following ways: 
 


 

 
We have the ability to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets, in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships,
particularly with financial institutions. This can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities.   


 

 
Our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we can increase the value of assets and cash flows, such as in the case of distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity,
under-managed or under-leased assets or other repositioning opportunities.   


 

 
Many times, these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales, thereby offering opportunities to achieve above average total returns. In many cases, we have the opportunity to
earn significant additional returns, such as through a promoted interest based on the performance of the assets.   


 

 
KW Services plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value
through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies.   


 

 
We understand that real estate is cyclical. Our management team employs a multi-cyclical approach that has resulted in our AUM being globally diversified across many sectors of real estate while maintaining a healthy
liquidity position and adequate access to capital.  Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the combination of a service business and an investment platform provides us with significant competitive advantages and allows us
to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. We use our service platform to facilitate the origination of investment opportunities, enhance the investment process and ensure the alignment of interests with our investors interests. Our
competitive advantages include:   


 

 
Transaction experience: Our Executive Committee has more than 125 years of combined real estate experience and has been working and investing together, on average, for over 15 years. Members of the Executive
Committee have collectively acquired, developed and managed in excess of $20 billion of real estate investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Japan throughout various economic cycles, both at our company and throughout their
careers.   


 

 
Extensive relationship and sourcing network: We leverage our services business in order to source off-market deals. In addition, the Executive Committee and our acquisition team have transacted deals in nearly
every major metropolitan market on the West Coast of the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Japan. Their local presence and reputation in these markets have enabled them to cultivate key relationships with major holders of
property inventory, particularly financial institutions, throughout the real estate community.

Table of Contents



 

 
Structuring expertise and speed of execution: Our prior acquisitions have taken a variety of forms, including direct property investments, joint ventures, participating loans and investments in performing and
non-performing mortgages with the objective of long-term ownership. We believe we have developed a reputation of being able to quickly execute, as well as originate and creatively structure, acquisitions, dispositions and financing transactions.
  


 

 
Vertically integrated platform for operational enhancement: We have approximately 400 employees, with 24 regional offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Japan and work with
over 2,000 operating associates. We have a hands-on approach to real estate investing and possess the local expertise in property management, leasing, construction management, development and investment sales, which, we believe, enable us to invest
successfully in selected submarkets.   


 

 
Risk protection and investment discipline: We underwrite our investments based upon a thorough examination of property economics and a critical understanding of market dynamics and risk management strategies. We
conduct an in-depth sensitivity analysis on each of our acquisitions. This analysis applies various economic scenarios that include changes to rental rates, absorption periods, operating expenses, interest rates, exit values and holding periods. We
use this analysis to develop our disciplined acquisition strategies.  Recent Developments 
Acquisition Activity  Subsequent to
December 31, 2013, we and our equity partners acquired $424.8 million of real estate-related investments, which include one commercial portfolio, three commercial properties including a hotel, two multifamily properties, one loan
origination and one loan purchase secured by real estate. Our total equity investment in these transactions was approximately $158.3 million. Our investments since December 31, 2013 included the following: 
 


 

 
Real estate: We and our equity partners acquired a 14-asset commercial portfolio in the United Kingdom and 3 commercial properties in the Western United States, including a 201-room hotel, totaling approximately
1.7 million square feet. In addition, we acquired a multifamily property in the Western United States and one in Ireland consisting of 398 total units.   


 

 
Loans: We acquired notes secured by the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, Ireland for approximately $152.4 million (approximately $74.4 million of equity invested). We also originated a $5 million loan
secured by real estate in the Western United States.  In addition, on February 28, 2014, we subscribed for a total of
£122.0 million (approximately $203.0 million) of ordinary shares in the initial public offering of Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc, or KWE, LSE:KWE. Our investment consists of £87.0 million (approximately $145.0 million)
of cash subscription and the contribution of £35.0 million (approximately $58.0 million) of assets acquired by Kennedy Wilson in the first quarter of 2014. The assets consist of 14 properties located in the United Kingdom totaling
approximately 1.2 million square feet. KWE announced the closing of its initial public offering on February 28, 2014, raising approximately £1 billion (approximately $1.7 billion) in gross proceeds (including the exercise of the
£91 million (approximately $151 million) over-allotment option). Immediately following the closing, Kennedy Wilsons investment represented approximately 12.2% of KWEs total share capital, making Kennedy
Wilson the largest shareholder of KWE. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is acting as KWEs external manager, in which capacity we will be entitled to receive certain management and performance fees. In addition, KWE will be
provided priority access to all investment opportunities sourced by us in Europe. As of March 18, 2014, KWE 
 
  S-7 


Table of Contents


is under contract to purchase a portfolio of 26 real estate assets located across the United Kingdom at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $253.9 million. There can be no
assurances that KWE will complete this transaction.  The investment management agreement between us and KWE provides us with
control, as defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 810Consolidation, over KWE. Accordingly, we expect that our consolidated financial statements will include the accounts of KWE beginning with the quarter ending
March 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, after giving pro forma effect to the expected consolidation of KWEs accounts in our consolidated financial statements, our total assets would have been approximately $3.3 billion.
However, because we own only 12.2% interest in KWE, KWE will not be treated as a subsidiary under the terms of the indenture and will not be bound by the covenants contained in the indenture. 
Pipeline  As of March 18, 2014, we
are under separate contracts to purchase three real estate-related investments in the United States and Ireland at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $148.5 million. We anticipate financing these acquisitions with a combination of
debt financing and third party equity. With respect to two of such real estate-related assets with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $122.0 million, we have non-refundable deposits of approximately $10.1 million held in escrow. The
amount of our equity investment in these acquisitions has not yet been determined, but we currently expect our aggregate equity investment in these acquisitions to be approximately $54.4 million. There can be no assurances that we will complete the
potential acquisitions under contract.  January 2014 Public Offering of Common Stock 
In January 2014, we raised net proceeds of approximately $191.0 million in a public offering of 9.2 million shares of our common
stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by us.  Revolving Credit Facility Draw
 Although as of December 31, 2013, our unsecured revolving credit facility was undrawn, as of March 17, 2014, we had $90.0
million of outstanding indebtedness as well as $0.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest under this facility, and we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering of notes to repay the outstanding balance under this facility.

Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. Our corporate headquarters is located at 9701 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 700, Beverly

Table of Contents



 
As of December 31, 2013, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by us, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility:   


 

 
we and our subsidiaries that are guarantors would have had approximately $779.4 million of total senior indebtedness outstanding (excluding debt premium and discount), of which: 
 


 

 
$74.4 million would have been secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness; and   


 

 
$705.0 million would have been senior unsecured indebtedness, consisting of the notes we are offering hereby, $55.0 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2042, which we refer to as the 2042 notes, and $350.0
million of our 8.750% Senior Notes due 2019, which we refer to as our 2019 notes; and   


 

 
we would have no indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility and would have $140.0 million of availability under this facility. 
 


 
As of December 31, 2013, we had $40.0 million of subordinated indebtedness consisting entirely of our junior subordinated debentures due 2037, which we refer to as the 2037 debentures. 
 


 
In addition, as of such date, we and our subsidiary guarantors had $18.9 million aggregate principal amount of guarantees that we and our guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by assets held in
various joint ventures that have recourse to us and our guarantors.   


 
 For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately 64% and 55%, respectively, of
Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated revenues, and the operating income of our non-guarantor subsidiaries for these periods was approximately $3.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, the total assets of those
subsidiaries constituted approximately 45% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated total assets, and those subsidiaries had $328.0 million of secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt discount), of which none has recourse
to us. However, these figures are as of December 31, 2013 and do not reflect transactions that we have entered into after that date, including the KWE transaction, or future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms
of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into, those subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the Indenture to guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and
these figures may increase or decrease materially in

future periods. For example, the instruments governing our acquisitions (such as the relevant loan agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company
operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or any related joint venture agreement or the terms of any relevant Co-investment Vehicle or separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from
guaranteeing the Notes. In many such cases, the Indenture does not require our subsidiaries, including those described above, to guarantee the Notes. In addition, the Indenture does not require certain non-material and non-wholly owned subsidiaries
to guarantee the Notes.   


 Optional Redemption 
At any time prior to April 1, 2019, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the redemption date, as described in this prospectus supplement.   


 
At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2019, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices specified under the caption Description of the NotesOptional
Redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.   


 
Prior to April 1, 2017, we may redeem up to 35% of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings.   


 
There is no sinking fund for the notes.   


 
See Description of the NotesOptional Redemption.   


 Fundamental Change 
Upon a fundamental change (as defined under Description of the NotesFundamental Change), we will be required to make an offer to purchase the notes. The purchase price will equal 101 % of the principal amount of the notes
to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). We may not have sufficient
funds available at the time of any fundamental change to make any required debt repayment (including repurchases of the notes). See Risk FactorsRisk Related to the NotesWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to
finance a fundamental change offer.   


 Certain Covenants 
The terms of the notes restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:   


 

 
incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;   


 

 
pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock;   


 


However, these limitations will be subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. See Description of the NotesCertain Covenants. 
 


 No Listing; No Established Trading Market 
We do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or have them quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system. The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. An active and liquid trading market for the notes
may not develop. If an active or liquid trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected.   


 Form and Denomination 
The notes will be initially issued in the form of one or more global securities, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and deposited with the trustee for the notes as custodian for The
Depository Trust Company, or DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. See Description of the NotesBook Entry, Delivery and Form. 
 


 Use of Proceeds 
We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes we are offering will be approximately $290.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
 


 
We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and co-investments, and to repay the outstanding balance under our unsecured revolving
credit facility described under the caption Description of Other Indebtedness. As of March 17, 2014, we had an outstanding balance under this facility of $90.0 million, as well as $0.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest.
See Use of Proceeds.   


 Risk Factors 
 Investing in the notes involves substantial risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth or referred to under the caption Risk Factors beginning on page S-17
of this prospectus supplement, together with the risks described under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

EBITDA represents net income before non-controlling interest income, interest expense, our share of interest expense included in income from investments in joint ventures and loan pool participations, depreciation and
amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from investments in joint ventures, loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt and income taxes for the Company. We do not adjust EBITDA for gains or losses on the
extinguishment of mortgage debt as we are in the business of purchasing discounted notes secured by real estate and, in connection with these note purchases, we may resolve these loans through discounted payoffs with the borrowers. EBITDA is not a
recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of
free cash flow available for managements discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Our presentation of EBITDA has limitations as an analytical
tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. EBITDA is not calculated under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows or
other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of our overall profitability or liquidity. Our management believes EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry
because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating
performance. Additionally, we believe EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. 
 
  S-15 


Table of Contents



(2)
Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, as defined above, adjusted to exclude corporate merger and acquisition related expenses and share based compensation expense for the Company. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to
analyze our business because it adjusts EBITDA for items that are non cash or that we believe do not have an accurate reflection of the nature of our business going forward. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to
overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements
under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical
calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our managements
discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt
instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making
certain restricted payments. 


(3)
The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings consists of pretax income from continuing operations before non-controlling
interest and our equity in income of joint ventures plus fixed charges and operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to
indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. 


(4)
For the year ended December 31, 2011, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $6.5 million. 


(5)
Investment Account is defined as investments in joint ventures plus real estate, net of depreciation, plus notes receivable plus loan pool participations plus acquired in-place lease value, net of amortization plus
marketable securities less mortgage debt.  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to
net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods indicated:

RISK FACTORS 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the term notes refers to the notes we are offering pursuant to this
prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. Kennedy-Wilson is the primary obligor under the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes, and the guarantors described in this prospectus supplement are guarantors of the 2042 notes and the 2019
notes and will be the initial guarantors of the notes. In this section of this prospectus supplement, the words we, us, our and Kennedy-Wilson refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and not to any of its
subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.  Any investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully
consider the risks described below and all of the information contained or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus before deciding whether to purchase the notes, including the risks under the heading
Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, as well as the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement. The
risks and uncertainties described below and in the incorporated documents are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially
from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this prospectus supplement. In addition to the risk factors incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement, you
should consider the additional risk factors below:  Risks Related to the Notes 
The notes are expected to be rated below investment grade. 
Although the notes have not been rated yet, we have sought to obtain a rating for the notes. We currently expect the rating of the notes, if
obtained, to be below investment grade, which could adversely impact the market price of the notes. Securities rated below investment grade are generally subject to a higher risk of payment default and price volatility than similar, higher-rated
securities. Furthermore, increases in leverage or deteriorating outlooks for an issuer, or volatile markets, could lead to continued significant deterioration in market prices of securities rated below investment grade. 
Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies, and ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn
entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. Furthermore, a rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the notes. In addition, ratings do not reflect market prices or the suitability of a
security for a particular investor, and any rating of the notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business or the structure or market value of the notes. An explanation of the significance of ratings may be obtained from the applicable
rating agency.  A credit rating may not be issued and may not remain in effect for any given period of time, and the applicable rating
agency may lower, suspend or withdraw entirely any rating that it has issued if, in that rating agencys judgment, the circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that any rating assigned to the notes may be lowered in connection with the
application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions. Holders of the notes will have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of the issuance of a lower-than-expected rating or
a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such a rating. Any lower-than-expected rating, and any lowering, suspension or withdrawal of an issued rating, may adversely affect the market price or marketability of the notes. 
  S-17 


Table of Contents
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our
obligations under the notes.  As of December 31, 2013, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the issuance and sale of
$300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be paid by us, Kennedy-Wilson and its subsidiaries that are guarantors would have had
$779.4 million of outstanding indebtedness (excluding debt premium and discount), of which $74.4 million is secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness and $705.0 million is unsecured senior indebtedness, consisting of the notes we are
offering; $55.0 of the 2042 notes and $350.0 million of 2019 notes; and $40.0 million of indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes. In addition, as of such date, we and the
subsidiary guarantors had $18.9 million aggregate principal amount of guarantees that we and our subsidiary guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by consolidated assets and assets held in various joint ventures that have recourse
to us. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries had $328.0 million of secured, non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt discount) as of December 31, 2013; and the notes we hereby are offering are structurally subordinated to such
indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you including:   


 

 
it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements; 
 


 

 
it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;   


 

 
we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;   


 

 
it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy;   


 

 
the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes; 
 


 

 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes; and 
 


 

 
our business and financial condition would materially and adversely suffer if we were unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes, or obtain additional financing, as needed. 
In addition, the indenture governing the notes will contain, and the indentures governing the 2042 notes, the 2019 notes and the 2037
debentures and our unsecured revolving credit facility contain, financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in
an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.  Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may
still incur significantly more debt. which could exacerbate the risks described above.  The indenture governing the notes will permit,
and the indentures governing the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes and our unsecured revolving credit facility permit, us and our subsidiaries to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. As of March 17, 2014, we had $90.0 million of
outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as $0.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering of notes to repay the outstanding balance under this credit
facility. Consequently, immediately after this offering and such repayment, we expect to have no outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $140.0 million available for additional borrowing under that facility,
subject to certain conditions. 
  S-18 


Table of Contents
We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a fundamental change offer. 
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes), which
includes a change of control event or delisting of our common stock, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes. We may have insufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the
notes, the 2042 notes or the 2019 notes upon a fundamental change. In addition, our unsecured revolving credit facility provides that the occurrence of a change of control constitutes a default. Our failure to purchase tendered notes, 2042 notes and
2019 notes would constitute a default under the relevant indenture governing the same, which, in turn, would constitute a default under our credit facility. See Description of the NotesFundamental Change. 
In the event of a change of control or termination of trading of our common stock, our Series A and Series B preferred stock will be redeemable at the
option of the stockholders thereof.  Under the indentures governing the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes, upon the occurrence
of a fundamental change (as defined in those indentures), which includes a change of control event or a delisting of our common stock, each noteholder will have the right to require us to purchase that noteholders notes, 2042 notes or 2019
notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. The occurrence of a fundamental change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders of our Series A and
Series B preferred stock under the applicable certificate of designation. Under the terms of these indentures, Kennedy-Wilson may not make any restricted payment to facilitate a redemption of the Series A and Series B preferred stock unless
Kennedy-Wilson has restricted payment capacity or has previously made an offer to noteholders to purchase their notes. If the noteholders, however, fail for any reason to tender all of their notes under the offer to purchase them, and our preferred
stockholders accept the offer to purchase the Series A and Series B preferred stock, we will be required to use cash to fund the purchase of our Series A and Series B preferred stock. In the event this occurs, it may be more difficult for us to make
scheduled payments on the untendered notes. See Description of the NotesFundamental Change. In addition, we may not redeem the Series A and Series B preferred stock without the consent of the lenders under our unsecured revolving
credit facility. Our failure to purchase the Series A and B preferred stock when required could give the holders of that stock a legal claim against us. 
A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law, which would prevent the holders
of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.  Under U.S. bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state
fraudulent transfer laws, a subsidiary guarantee can be voided, or claims under the subsidiary guarantee may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor, if, among other things, the subsidiary guarantor, at the time it incurred
the indebtedness evidenced by its subsidiary guarantee or, in some states, when payments become due under the subsidiary guarantee, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the subsidiary guarantee
and:   


 

 
was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;   


 

 
was engaged in a business or transaction for which the subsidiary guarantors remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or 
 


 

 
intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature. 
A subsidiary guarantee may also be voided, without regard to the above factors, if a court finds that the subsidiary guarantor entered into
the subsidiary guarantee with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. 
  S-19 


Table of Contents
A court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for its subsidiary guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. If a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee, you would no longer have a claim
against the subsidiary guarantor. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from
the subsidiary guarantor.  The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending on the governing law.
Generally, a subsidiary guarantor would be considered insolvent if:   


 

 
the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;   


 

 
the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they became absolute and mature; or
  


 

 
it could not pay its debts as they became due.  Each subsidiary guarantee will contain a
provision intended to limit the subsidiary guarantors liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of its obligations under its subsidiary guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be
effective to protect the subsidiary guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law.  The notes will not be guaranteed by all of our
subsidiaries.  The notes will not be guaranteed by a number of our subsidiaries. To the extent that any of our subsidiaries do not
guarantee the notes, the notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations, including indebtedness, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries. The claims of creditors of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade
creditors, will have priority as to the assets of those subsidiaries. As a result, if we default on our obligations under the notes, you will not have any claims against any of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. For the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately 64% and 55%, respectively, of Kennedy-Wilson Holding, Inc.s consolidated revenues, and the operating income of our non-guarantor
subsidiaries for these periods was approximately $3.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately 45% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated
total assets, and those subsidiaries had $328.0 million of secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt discount), of which none has recourse to us. However, these figures are as of December 31, 2013 and do not reflect
transactions that we have entered into after that date, including the KWE transaction, or future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may
enter into, those subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the indenture governing the notes to guarantee the notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future
periods. For example, the instruments governing our acquisitions (such as the relevant loan agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or
any related joint venture agreement or the terms of any relevant Co-investment Vehicle or separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the notes. In many such cases, the indenture does not require
our subsidiaries, including those described above, to guarantee the notes. In addition, the Indenture does not require, subject to limitation, certain non-material and non-wholly owned subsidiaries to guarantee the notes.

Table of Contents
We may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries and our joint ventures that may
be needed to make payment on the notes.  Although our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, our
subsidiaries and joint ventures are not obligated to make funds available to us for payment on the notes. Accordingly, our ability to make payments on the notes depends on the earnings of, and the distribution of funds from, our subsidiaries and
joint ventures. Furthermore, our subsidiaries will be permitted under the terms of the indentures governing the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes, our unsecured revolving credit facility and the instruments governing other indebtedness to
incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans by those subsidiaries to us. The agreements governing the future indebtedness of our subsidiaries may
not permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on the notes when due. See Description of Other Indebtedness. 
To service our indebtedness, including the notes, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors that
are beyond our control.  Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund planned
capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
However, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, current capital spending projects may require significant
additional funds to complete or be successful and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we consummate an acquisition,
our debt service requirements could increase. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes, on or before maturity. We may be unable to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our unsecured revolving credit
facility, the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  An active trading market for the notes may not
develop.  Prior to this offering, there was no public market for the notes. We have been informed by certain of the underwriters that
they intend to make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the underwriters may cease their market-making activities at any time. In addition, the liquidity of the trading market in the notes and the market price quoted for
the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or in the financial performance or prospects of companies in our industry generally. As a result,
an active trading market may not develop or be maintained for the notes. If an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price of the notes may decline and the liquidity of the notes may be limited. 
Our debt agreements will contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
The indenture governing the notes will contain, the indentures governing the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes and the agreement governing our
unsecured revolving credit facility contains, various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit Kennedy-Wilsons and its restricted subsidiaries ability to, among other things:
  


 

 
incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;   


 

 
pay dividends or distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock; 
  S-21 


Table of Contents


 

 
make investments;   


 

 
create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us;   


 

 
sell the stock of our subsidiaries;   


 

 
transfer or sell assets;   


 

 
create liens;   


 

 
enter into sale/leaseback transactions;   


 

 
enter into transactions with affiliates; and   


 

 
enter into mergers or consolidations.  Additionally, the agreement governing our unsecured
revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing the notes, the 2042 notes and the 2019 notes and the agreement governing our
unsecured revolving credit facility. We may also be unable to take advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness. See Description of Other
Indebtedness.  Many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade by
Moodys and S&P and no event of default has occurred and is continuing.  Many of the covenants in the indenture governing the
notes will not apply if the notes are rated investment grade (as defined in the indenture) by Moodys and S&P, provided that at such time no event of default with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing. There can be no
assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or, if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain such ratings. Termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be
permitted while these covenants were in force. See Description of the NotesCertain Covenants.

USE OF PROCEEDS 
We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be approximately $290.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions and co-investments, and to repay the
outstanding balance under Kennedy-Wilsons unsecured revolving credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association, East-West Bank and The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland described under the caption Description of Other
Indebtedness. As of March 17, 2014, we had an outstanding balance under this facility of $90.0 million, as well as $0.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest. Loans under this facility mature on October 1, 2016 and bear
interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.75%.

DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with U.S. Bank and East-West Bank
 We have an unsecured revolving credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association, East-West Bank and The Governor and Company of
the Bank of Ireland. The borrower under the unsecured revolving credit facility is Kennedy-Wilson, Inc., and Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. is the sole guarantor. 
Under the revolving loan agreement, we have: (a) a $105.0 million senior unsecured facility to finance our or our subsidiaries or
affiliates acquisition of commercial real property or pools of notes secured by commercial real property, so long as we have management control of those subsidiaries or affiliates (Facility A); and (b) a $35.0 million senior
unsecured facility for general business purposes, including working capital needs and equity investments (Facility B). Both Facility A and Facility B bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.75%. All
principal and other amounts owing with respect to advances made under the revolving credit agreement will be due and payable in full on October 1, 2016. 
On March 18, 2014, the lenders under this facility executed and delivered a letter agreement consenting to our issuance of certain notes,
including the notes offered hereby. This consent letter also provides that (i) the lenders must consent to any change to the notes after the closing of this offering that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to repay our
obligations under the unsecured revolving credit facility and (ii) if there occurs an event of default, as that term is defined in the indenture governing the notes, that event will constitute an event of default under this facility. 
During 2013 and 2012, the average outstanding borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility were $14.9 million and $11.2 million,
respectively. The borrowings under Facility A had an annual interest rate of 2.92% and 2.96% during 2013 and 2012, respectively. The borrowings under Facility B had an annual interest rate of 2.92% and 2.96% during 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of
March 17, 2014, the principal amount outstanding under this unsecured revolving credit facility was $90.0 million, as well as $0.2 million of accrued and unpaid interest. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering of notes to
repay the outstanding balance under this credit facility.  The unsecured revolving credit facility contains customary financial,
affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenants under the revolving credit facility require us:   


 

 
to maintain a minimum rent-adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) of not less than 1.50 to 1.00, measured on a four-quarter rolling average basis; 
 


 

 
to maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and publicly traded marketable securities in the aggregate amount of at least $40.0 million, tested quarterly; 
 


 

 
to maintain a maximum balance sheet leverage (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) of not greater than 1.50 to 1.00, measured at the end of each calendar quarter; and 
 


 

 
to maintain an effective tangible net worth (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility) equal to or greater than $250.0 million, measured at the end of each calendar quarter. 
In addition to customary reporting and compliance requirements, the principal negative and affirmative covenants under the revolving credit
facility require us, among other things:   


 

 
not to incur indebtedness, other than those permitted by the revolving credit facility, without the prior written consent of the lenders; 
  S-28 


Table of Contents


 

 
not to permit any incurrence of liens, other than those permitted by the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
not to purchase or acquire capital stock or make other investments in another entity, except as permitted by the revolving credit facility; 
 


 

 
not to enter into a merger, consolidation, reorganization or recapitalization or to reincorporate in a different jurisdiction, liquidate or sell substantially all of our assets; 
 


 

 
not to dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business;   


 

 
not to (i) permit a person or group (other than William McMorrow, Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited and its affiliates, the heirs, assigns and successors of the foregoing, certain employee benefit plans and
certain other persons) to acquire more than 35% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc.s equity securities entitled to vote for members of its board of directors on a fully diluted basis; or (ii) otherwise suffer a change in control (as defined
in the revolving credit facility);   


 

 
not to engage in transactions with affiliates, except in the ordinary course of business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favorable than that which we would have obtained in an arms-length transaction
with non-affiliates;   


 

 
not to guaranty or otherwise become in any way liable with respect to the obligations of any third person, other than as permitted by the revolving credit facility; 
 


 

 
not to make corporate acquisitions in excess of $5.0 million without the prior written consent of the lenders; provided, that any such acquisitions approved by the lenders satisfy all other applicable requirements of
the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
not to prepay, redeem, retire, defease, purchase or otherwise acquire any indebtedness owing to any third person, other than (i) pursuant to a permitted refinancing, (ii) a purchase (for investment or sale) of
pools of notes secured by commercial real property and (iii) the obligations under the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
not to amend, modify, alter, increase or change, materially and adversely, any of the terms or conditions of any agreement, instrument, document, indenture or writing evidencing or concerning certain indebtedness
permitted to be incurred under the revolving credit facility;   


 

 
not to declare or pay corporate dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders, except as permitted by the revolving credit facility; 
 


 

 
to maintain insurance policies with certain minimum coverage; and   


 

 
not to make a change in the principal nature of our business;  On September 19, 2013, we
agreed to cause each of our subsidiaries that becomes a guarantor of our 2042 notes or our 2019 notes to become a guarantor under this credit facility. 
As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with such covenants. We pay customary fees to the agent and the revolving lenders under
our unsecured revolving credit facility.  7.75% Senior Notes due 2042 
In November 2012, we completed a public offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of Kennedy-Wilsons 7.75% Senior Notes due
2042 (the 2042 notes). In December 2012, the underwriters 
  S-29 


Table of Contents

exercised their option to purchase an additional $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2042 notes from us. The 2042 notes will mature on December 1, 2042 and bear interest at a rate of
7.75% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on March 1, 2013. 
The 2042 notes are Kennedy-Wilsons unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Kennedy-Wilsons
existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the same subsidiaries that guarantee the initial notes and that will guarantee the notes offered
hereby. The 2042 notes contain substantially similar restrictive covenants as those contained in the indenture governing the notes and initial notes, including, among others, limitations on Kennedy-Wilsons ability and the ability of certain of
its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make any other distributions from restricted subsidiaries, redeem or repurchase capital stock, sell assets or subsidiary stock, engage in
transactions with affiliates, create or permit liens on assets, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. 
At any time prior to December 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the 2042 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of their principal amount, plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after December 1, 2017, Kennedy-Wilson may redeem the 2042
notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. 
8.750% Senior Notes due 2019  In April
2011, in a private placement, we issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.750% senior notes due April 1, 2019 (the 2019 notes) with an effective yield of 8.875% and an additional $50.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 2019 notes with an effective yield of 8.486%. In December 2012, we issued an additional $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2019 notes with an effective yield of 7.306%. Interest on the 2019 notes is payable on April 1 and
October 1 of each year.  The 2019 notes are guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the same subsidiaries that will be the
initial guarantors under the indenture governing the notes. The 2019 notes contain substantially similar restrictive covenants as those that will be contained in the indenture governing the notes we are offering, including, among others, limitations
on our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pay dividends or make any other distributions from restricted subsidiaries, redeem or repurchase capital stock,
sell assets or subsidiary stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, create or permit liens on assets, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and enter into consolidations or mergers. 
At any time prior to April 1, 2015, we may redeem the 2019 notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount,
plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any time and from time to time on or after April 1, 2015, we may redeem the 2019 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price equal to a specified percentage of the principal amount to be redeemed, ranging from 104.375% to 100.000%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. Prior to April 1, 2017, we may redeem up to 35% of the 2019
notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings. There is no sinking fund for the 2019 notes.  Junior Subordinated Debentures 
In 2007, we issued junior subordinated debentures (the 2037 debentures) in the amount of $40.0 million. The 2037 debentures were
issued to a trust established by us, which contemporaneously issued $40.0 million of trust preferred securities to Merrill Lynch International. The interest rate on the 2037 debentures is fixed for the first ten years at 9.06%, and variable
thereafter at LIBOR plus 3.70%. Interest is payable quarterly with the principal due in April 30, 2037. 
  S-30 


Table of Contents
Prior to April 30, 2012, we were permitted to redeem the 2037 debentures, upon a Special
Event, as defined in the indenture, at a redemption price equal to 107.5% of the outstanding principal amount. After April 30, 2012, we may redeem the 2037 debentures, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date at par plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any.  The indenture governing the 2037 debentures require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants,
including, among others:   


 

 
a fixed charge coverage ratio not less than 1.75 to 1.00;   


 


December 31, 2013, the outstanding principal amount under these loans was $402.4 million (excluding debt discount), with a weighted average interest rate of 4.28% and a weighted average remaining maturity of 7 years. As of
December 31, 2013, $74.4 million of this indebtedness was indebtedness of our guarantor subsidiaries and $328.0 million (excluding debt discount) was indebtedness of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  In 2010, we entered into a 6.0% Convertible
Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series A Purchase Agreement) with Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (Fairfax) for the issuance and sale in a private placement of up to 100,000 shares of series A Preferred
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $1,000 per share. We sold and issued to certain affiliates of Fairfax a total of 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for a total purchase
price of $100,000,000. In accordance with the terms of the Series A Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Fairfax (the Series A Registration Rights Agreement). Under the Series A Registration
Rights Agreement, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock have certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred
Stock.  The Series A Preferred Stock has the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Designation
(the Series A Certificate of Designation) we filed with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware. Under the Series A Certificate of Designation, prior to May 19, 2015, each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at
the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 81 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. On May 19, 2015, each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into
shares of our common stock. Cumulative dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock accrue at an annual rate of 6% per $1,000 of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. Subject to limited exceptions,
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will have no voting or management rights. The Series A Certificate of Designation contains customary anti-dilution protection. 
We also entered into a Convertible Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the Series B Purchase Agreement) with Fairfax, for
the issuance and sale in a private placement of 32,550 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock, and together with the Series A Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock), at a
purchase price of $1,000 per share or a total purchase price of $32,550,000. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into approximately 3 million shares of our common stock. In accordance with the terms of the Series B Purchase Agreement,
we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the Series B Registration Rights Agreement) and Shareholders Agreement with Fairfax. Under the Series B Registration Rights Agreement, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock have
certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. Under the Shareholders Agreement, certain of our stockholders
have agreed to vote all of the shares of voting stock held by such stockholders in favor of Fairfaxs designee to our Board of Directors. We also agreed to nominate Fairfaxs designee as a member of the Board of Directors. 
The Series B Preferred Stock has the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions set forth in the Certificate of Designation (the
Series B Certificate of Designation, and, together with the Series A Certificate of Designation, the Certificates of Designation) we filed with the Secretary of State of the state of Delaware. Under the Series B Certificate
of Designation, prior to November 3, 2018, each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder at any time, into approximately 93 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustments under certain circumstances (the
Series B Conversion Rate). At any time on or after May 3, 2017 and prior to November 3, 2018, we have the option to convert all or part of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at
the Series B Conversion Rate. On November 3, 2018, each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of our common stock at the Series B Conversion Rate. Cumulative dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock accrue at an annual rate of $64.52 per share. The dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. Subject to limited exceptions, holders of the

Table of Contents

Series B Preferred Stock will have no voting rights. The Series B Certificate of Designation contains customary anti-dilution protection. 
Under the Certificates of Designation, upon a change of control of or a delisting of our common stock (as such terms are defined in the
Certificates of Designation), a fundamental change will have deemed to have occurred. In the event a fundamental change occurs, we must offer to purchase all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the change of control or delisting of our common stock at a purchase price per share equal to $1,150 plus all accumulated and accrued dividends to the effective date of such fundamental change. On March 18, 2014, in connection with this offering
of notes, Fairfax waived the requirement set forth in the Certificates of Designation that provides that the offer to purchase upon a fundamental change be made at least 20 business days prior to the effective date (as such term is defined in the
Certificates of Designation) of the fundamental change. Instead, we are required to complete such an offer within 90 days following completion of the fundamental change offer made to holders of the notes. 
Preferred Stock converted after a fundamental change will automatically receive a number of shares of our common stock as provided for in the
applicable Certificates of Designation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES 
In this description, the words we, us, our and Issuer refer to Kennedy-Wilson, Inc. and not to
any of its subsidiaries. Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading Certain Definitions. 
We will issue the notes under an indenture (the Base Indenture), to be dated as of March 25, 2014, between us
and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture thereto (the Supplemental Indenture, and, together with the Base Indenture, the
Indenture), to be dated as of March 25, 2014, among us, the Trustee and the initial Guarantors. The Notes will be a series of debt securities under the Base Indenture the terms of which will be established by the
Supplemental Indenture.  The following description of the particular terms of the Notes and the Guarantees supplements and, to the extent
inconsistent therewith, replaces the description of the general terms and provisions of the debt securities and the guarantees set forth in the accompanying prospectus, to which reference is hereby made. The terms of the Notes include those stated
in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the Trust Indenture Act). The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. We
urge you to read the Indenture because it, not this description, defines your rights as holders of these Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture at our address set forth under the heading Where You Can Find More Information. 
Brief Description of the Notes  These
Notes:   


 

 
are unsecured senior obligations of the Issuer;   


 

 
are senior in right of payment to all existing and any future Subordinated Obligations of the Issuer; and   


 

 
will be guaranteed by Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. (Parent) and each Subsidiary Guarantor on a senior basis. 
Principal, Maturity and Interest 
The Issuer will initially issue Notes with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The Issuer will issue the
Notes in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2024. Subject to our compliance with the covenant described under the subheading Certain
CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, we are permitted to issue more notes under the Indenture in an unlimited aggregate principal amount (the Additional Notes), provided that if the Additional Notes are not
fungible with the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will have a separate CUSIP number. The Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
series of Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Holders of the Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will
vote as one class under the Indenture. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this Description of the Notes, references to the Notes include any Additional Notes actually issued. 
Interest on these Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.875% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and
October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2014. We will make each interest payment to the holders of record of these Notes on the immediately preceding March 15 and September 15, respectively. 
  S-34 


Table of Contents
Interest on these Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has
already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 
Optional Redemption  Except as set forth
below, we will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at our option.  On and after April 1, 2019, we will be entitled at our option to
redeem all or a portion of these Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at the redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount on the redemption date), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on April 1 of the years set
forth below:

 In addition, before April 1, 2017, we will be entitled at our option on one or more occasions to
redeem Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) originally issued at a redemption price (expressed as
a percentage of principal amount ) of 105.875%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings (provided that if the Equity
Offering is an offering by Parent, a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof equal to the amount required to redeem any such Notes is contributed to the equity capital of the Issuer), provided that: 
(1) at least 65% of such aggregate principal amount of Notes (which includes Additional Notes, if any) remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Issuer or its Affiliates); and  (2) each
such redemption occurs within 90 days after the date of the related Equity Offering.  Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering
may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such redemption or notice, may, at the Issuers discretion, be subject to the completion of the related Equity Offering. 
Prior to April 1, 2019, we will be entitled, at our option, to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the redemption date (subject to the right of holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date). Notice of such redemption must be delivered electronically if held at DTC or mailed by first-class mail to each holders registered address, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. 
Applicable Premium means with respect to a Note at any redemption date, as provided by the Issuer, the greater of
(1) 1.00% of the principal amount of such Note on such redemption date and (2) the excess of (A) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note on April 1, 2019 (such redemption price
being described in the second paragraph in this Optional Redemption section, exclusive of any accrued and unpaid interest) plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due on such Note through April 1,
2019 (but excluding accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date), computed using 
  S-35 


Table of Contents

a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate, over (B) the principal amount of such Note on such redemption date. 
Adjusted Treasury Rate means, with respect to any redemption date and as provided by the Issuer, (1) the yield, under
the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H. 15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities, for the maturity corresponding to the
Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after April 1, 2019, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury
Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month) or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not
contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date, in
each case calculated on the third Business Day immediately preceding the date that the applicable redemption notice is first mailed or delivered electronically if held at DTC, in each case, plus 0.50%. 
Comparable Treasury Issue means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity
comparable to the remaining term of the Notes from the redemption date to April 1, 2019, that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of
a maturity most nearly equal to April 1, 2019.  Comparable Treasury Price means, with respect to any redemption
date, if clause (2) of the Adjusted Treasury Rate definition is applicable, the average of three, or such lesser number as is obtained by the Issuer, Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date. 
Quotation Agent means the Reference Treasury Dealer selected by the Issuer. 
Reference Treasury Dealer means each of (i) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. and (ii) a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States selected by U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., and in each case the respective successors and assigns of the foregoing. 
Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations means with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the
average, as determined by the Issuer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount, quoted in writing to the Issuer by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding date that the applicable redemption notice is first mailed or delivered electronically if held at DTC. 
Selection and Notice of Redemption 
If we are redeeming less than all the Notes at any time, the Trustee will select Notes on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method in
accordance with the procedures of DTC.  We will redeem Notes with principal amounts of $2,000 or less in whole and not in part. We will
cause notices of redemption to be delivered electronically if held at DTC or mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. 
If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount
thereof to be redeemed. We will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

No Sinking Fund; Open Market Purchases 
We are not required to make any sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, we may be required to
offer to purchase Notes as described under the captions Fundamental Change and Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. We may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in
the open market or otherwise.  Guaranties 
Parent and each Subsidiary Guarantor of the Issuer will jointly and severally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, our obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guaranty are designed to be limited as necessary to prevent such Subsidiary Guaranty from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law and,
therefore, will be expressly limited to the maximum amount that such Subsidiary Guaranty could guarantee without such Subsidiary Guaranty constituting a fraudulent conveyance. This limitation, however, may not be effective to prevent such Subsidiary
Guaranty from constituting a fraudulent conveyance. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law, which would
prevent the holders of the Notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.  If a Subsidiary Guaranty were rendered
voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Subsidiary Guarantors
liability on its Subsidiary Guaranty could be reduced to zero. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. bankruptcy or similar state law,
which would prevent the holders of the Notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.  The Subsidiary Guaranty of a
Subsidiary Guarantor will be deemed to be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without the need of any action on the part of such Subsidiary Guarantor or the Trustee or otherwise: 
(1) upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any transaction pursuant to which such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Issuer);  (2) upon the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor;  (3) upon the designation of such Subsidiary
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Non-Material Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Indenture;  (4) upon a legal defeasance
or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided under Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge; or  (5) as
described under Amendments and Waivers,  in the case of clause (1) or (2), other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and
as permitted by the Indenture.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties, if the Issuer, due
to an error made in good faith, causes any Person to execute the Supplemental Indenture or any other supplement to the Base Indenture, or any other instrument, purporting to cause such Person to guarantee the Notes and become a Subsidiary Guarantor
and, at the time of such execution, such Person is not a domestic Subsidiary of the Issuer, then, notwithstanding such Supplemental Indenture or other supplement or instrument, the Subsidiary 
  S-37 


Table of Contents

Guaranty of such Person shall automatically, and without the need for any action on the part of the Issuer, such Person or the Trustee or otherwise, be null and void, with the same force and
effect as if such execution had never occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuer and such Person may nonetheless thereafter execute and deliver to the Trustee such instruments or other documents that shall memorialize the
nullification of such Subsidiary Guaranty.  Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. Also, the joint venture and fund
entities in which we have investments and their respective subsidiaries (which are not Subsidiaries of the Issuer as of the date of the Indenture) are not guarantors and are not subject to any of the obligations and covenants described hereunder. In
the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their
assets to us. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the revenues of our non-guarantor subsidiaries constituted approximately 64% and 55%, respectively, of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings consolidated revenues, and the operating income
of our non-guarantor subsidiaries for those periods was approximately $3.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, the total assets of those subsidiaries constituted approximately 45% of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings
consolidated total assets, and those subsidiaries had $328.0 million of secured non-recourse mortgage indebtedness (excluding debt discount), of which none has recourse to us. However, these figures are as of December 31, 2013 and do not
reflect transactions that we have entered into after that date or future transactions that we may enter into. Depending on the particular terms of any acquisition or other transaction that one or more of our subsidiaries may enter into, those
subsidiaries may not be required by the terms of the Indenture to guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, these figures may fluctuate from time to time, and these figures may increase or decrease materially in future periods. For example, the instruments
governing our acquisitions (such as the relevant loan agreement, or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the borrower, or any related joint venture agreement or
the terms of any relevant Co-investment Vehicle or separate account or investment program) may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the Notes. In many such cases, the Indenture does not require our subsidiaries, including those
described above, to guarantee the Notes.  Ranking 
The indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and the Guaranties will be senior unsecured obligations and will rank pari passu in
right of payment with all other unsecured Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be.  As of
December 31, 2013, on an as adjusted basis, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses to be
paid by us:  (a) the Issuers and the Guarantors Senior Indebtedness would have been approximately $779.4 million, of which:
 (1) $74.4 million would have been secured Non-Recourse Indebtedness under mortgage loans; 
(2) $705.0 million would have been unsecured Senior Indebtedness, consisting of the Notes offered hereby, $55.0 million of the
Issuers 7.75% Senior Notes due 2042 and $350.0 million of the Issuers 8.750% Senior Notes due 2019; and  (3)
the Issuer had $0.0 Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement and had $140.0 million of availability thereunder; and  (b)
the Issuer had $40.0 million of subordinated Indebtedness, consisting entirely of its Subordinated Debentures. 
  S-38 


Table of Contents
In addition, as of such date, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors would have had
$18.9 million aggregate principal amount of Guarantees that the Issuer and the Guarantors provided in connection with loans secured by assets held in various joint ventures and that are recourse to the Issuer and the Guarantors. 
The Notes and the Guaranties are unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be. Secured debt and other secured
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt or other obligations. In addition, all Indebtedness and trade payables of
non-guarantor Subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes and the Guaranties.  Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the
notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesThe notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries. 
Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
incur, under certain circumstances the amount of such Indebtedness could be substantial and, subject to the limitations set forth in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens, such Indebtedness may be
secured Indebtedness. See Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness and Limitation on Liens.  Fundamental
Change  Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, each noteholder shall have the right to require that the Issuer purchase such
noteholders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).  Within 30 days following any Fundamental
Change, unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the Notes as described under Optional Redemption, we will mail (or deliver electronically, if held at DTC) a notice to each noteholder with a copy to the Trustee (the
Fundamental Change Offer) stating:  (1) that a Fundamental Change has occurred and that such
noteholder has the right to require us to purchase such noteholders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase
(subject to the right of noteholders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); 
(2) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Fundamental Change (including information with respect to pro forma historical income,
cash flow and capitalization, in each case after giving effect to such Fundamental Change);  (3) the purchase date (which shall be no
earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); and  (4) the instructions, as determined by us,
consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a noteholder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased.  We will not be
required to make a Fundamental Change Offer following a Fundamental Change if a third party makes the Fundamental Change Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a
Fundamental Change Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Fundamental Change Offer or if we have exercised our option to redeem all the Notes pursuant to the provisions described under
Optional Redemption. 
  S-39 


Table of Contents
We will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes as a result of a Fundamental Change. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
covenant described hereunder, we will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the covenant described hereunder by virtue of our compliance with such securities laws or
regulations.  The Fundamental Change purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale
or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Fundamental Change purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the underwriters of the Notes. We have no present intention to engage in a
transaction involving a Change of Control and we do not foresee the occurrence of a Termination of Trading, although it is possible that, in the future, we could decide to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control or a Termination of
Trading occurs. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture
or result in a Termination of Trading, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness, and Limitation on Liens, which limitations may terminate as described under Defeasance and Satisfaction and
Discharge below. Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. 
Holders may not be entitled to require us to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition
of our Board of Directors, including in connection with a proxy contest where our Board of Directors does not approve a dissident slate of directors but approves them as continuing directors, even if our Board of Directors initially opposed the
directors.  The Credit Agreement provides that the occurrence of certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would
constitute a default thereunder. Future indebtedness that we may incur may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Fundamental Change or require the purchase of such indebtedness upon a Fundamental Change.
Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require us to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Fundamental Change itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on us. Our ability
to pay cash to the holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Fundamental Change may be limited by our then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
purchases. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a fundamental change offer. 
The occurrence of a Fundamental Change will also trigger a redemption right held by the holders of Parents Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock under their respective certificates of designation. Pursuant to paragraph (a) and clause (11) of paragraph (b) under the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted
Payments, we may not make any Restricted Payment to redeem or repurchase Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, unless we have sufficient restricted payment capacity or we have previously made an offer to
noteholders to repurchase the Notes. If the noteholders, however, reject our Fundamental Change Offer or fail for any reason to tender all of their Notes, and the stockholders of Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock
accept Parents offer to repurchase such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, we may have to pay dividends or make other payments to Parent so that it can use cash to fund the repurchase or redemption of its Series A
Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. In the event this occurs, it may be more difficult for us to make scheduled payments on the untendered Notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesIn the event of a

change of control or termination of trading of our common stock, our Series A and Series B preferred stock will be redeemable at the option of the stockholders thereof. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Fundamental Change Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon
such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of such Fundamental Change Offer. 
The phrase all or substantially all, as used with respect to the assets of the Issuer in the definition of Change of
Control, is subject to interpretation under applicable state law, and its applicability in a given instance would depend upon the facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or
transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer has occurred in a particular instance, in which case a holders ability to obtain the benefit of these provisions could be unclear. 
The provisions under the Indenture relative to our obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Fundamental Change may
be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes.  For purposes
of this discussion of a repurchase of the Notes following a Fundamental Change Change of Control means the occurrence of any of the following: 
(1) any person or group (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), is or becomes the
beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 35% (or, in the case of any Permitted Holder, 50%) of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Parent; 
(2) individuals who on the Issue Date constituted the Board of Directors (together with any new directors whose election by such Board of
Directors or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of the Parent was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Parent then still in office who were either directors on the Issue Date or whose election or nomination for
election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of Parent then in office; 
(3) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Parent; 
(4) the merger or consolidation of the Parent with or into another Person or the merger of another Person with or into the Parent, or the sale
of all or substantially all the consolidated assets of Parent (but in any event, upon the sale of more than 35% of the consolidated assets of the Parent), to another Person, other than a transaction following which (A) in the case of a merger
or consolidation transaction, holders of securities that represented 100% of the Voting Stock of the Parent immediately prior to such transaction (or other securities into which such securities are converted as part of such merger or consolidation
transaction) own, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation transaction immediately after such transaction and (B) in the case of a sale of assets
transaction, the transferee Person becomes the obligor in respect of the Notes and a Subsidiary of the transferor of such assets; or  (5)
the Parent ceases to own, directly, 100% of the Capital Stock of the Issuer.  For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining
beneficial ownership under clause (1) above, no Permitted Holder shall be deemed to be a person or group (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) with Fairfax. 
Fundamental Change shall mean the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Termination of Trading. 
  S-41 


Table of Contents
Termination of Trading shall mean the termination (but not the temporary
suspension) of trading of the Common Stock of Parent, which will be deemed to have occurred if the Common Stock or other securities into which the Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are convertible are not, or are
not permitted to be, listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other U.S. national securities exchange.  Certain Covenants 
The indenture contains, among others, the covenants described below. 
If on any date following the date of the Indenture: 
(1) the notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moodys and BBB- or better by S&P (or, if either such entity ceases to rate the notes for
reasons outside of the control of the Issuer, the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act
selected by the Issuer as a replacement agency); and  (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, 
then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants described below will be suspended: 
(1) Limitation on Indebtedness; 
(2) Limitation on Restricted Payments; 
(3) Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries; 
(4) Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock; and 
(5) clause (3) of the covenant described below under the caption Merger and Consolidation. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by either such rating agency should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB-,
respectively, then the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline. For the avoidance of doubt, calculations under the reinstated Limitation on Restricted Payments covenant will be made as if
such covenant had been in effect since April 1, 2011, except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made prior to the date of the Indenture or during the time such that covenant was suspended.
 There can be no assurance that the notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained. 
Limitation on Indebtedness  (a)
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur, directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; provided, however, that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to Incur Indebtedness (including
revolving credit Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence and after giving effect thereto, no Default has occurred and is continuing and the Maximum Balance Sheet Leverage Ratio is no greater than 1.5 to 1.0. 
  S-42 


Table of Contents
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will
be entitled to Incur any or all of the following Indebtedness:  (1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer pursuant to any
Credit Facility (including the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that, immediately after giving effect to any such Incurrence, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (1) and then outstanding
does not exceed the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 8.0% of Total Assets;  (2) Indebtedness owed to and
held by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock which results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any subsequent
transfer of such Indebtedness (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the obligor thereon and (B) if the Issuer is the obligor on such
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes; 
(3) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes); 
(4) Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries outstanding on the Issue Date (other than Indebtedness described in clause
(1), (2) or (3) of this covenant);  (5) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on or
prior to the date on which such Subsidiary was acquired by the Issuer (other than Indebtedness Incurred in connection with, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Subsidiary became a Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer); provided, however, at the time of such acquisition and after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (5) and then outstanding does not exceed $25.0 million;  (6) Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to paragraph (a) or pursuant to clause (3), (4), (5), or this clause (6); provided, however, that to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness directly or indirectly Refinances Indebtedness of a
Subsidiary Incurred pursuant to clause (5), such Refinancing Indebtedness shall be Incurred only by such Subsidiary;  (7)
Hedging Obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into in the ordinary course of business and not for the purpose of speculation; 
(8) obligations in respect of letters of credit, performance, bid and surety bonds, completion guarantees, budget guarantees,
payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar requirements provided by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business; 
(9) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument
drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of its Incurrence; 
(10) Indebtedness with respect to workers compensation claims in the ordinary course of business; 
(11) any Guarantee (including the Subsidiary Guaranties) by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of the Indenture,

Table of Contents
(12) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for indemnification,
deposits, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any business, assets or a Subsidiary; provided, however, that (A) such Indebtedness is
not reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (contingent obligations referred to in a footnote or footnotes to financial statements and not otherwise reflected on the balance sheet will not be deemed to be reflected
on such balance sheet for purposes of this clause (A)) and (B) in the case of a disposition, the maximum liability in respect of such Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds including noncash proceeds (the fair market value of
such noncash proceeds being determined at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value) actually received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such disposition; 
(13) Non-Recourse Indebtedness, Permitted Non-Recourse Carve-Out Guarantees and Permitted Co-investments; 
(14) Indebtedness constituting Subordinated Obligations, the net cash proceeds of which are used to purchase, repurchase,
redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value the Subordinated Debentures and with a Stated Maturity that is no earlier than 180 days after the Stated Maturity of the Notes; and 
(15) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (together with any refinancing thereof) in an aggregate principal
amount which, when taken together with all other Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the date of such Incurrence (other than Indebtedness permitted by clauses (1) through (14) above or paragraph (a)),
does not exceed the greater of (x) $37.5 million and (y) 2.0% of Total Assets.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing (except
to the extent provided in the foregoing clause (14)), none of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing paragraph (b) if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to Refinance any
Subordinated Obligations of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guaranty to at least the same extent as such Subordinated Obligations. 
(d) For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant: (1) any Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the Issue
Date will be treated as having been incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of paragraph (b) above; (2) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above,
the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness at the time of Incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in one of the above clauses in any manner
that complies with the covenant; and (3) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indebtedness incurred under the
Credit Agreement will be deemed to have been incurred under clause (1) of paragraph (b) above and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness. Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be
permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness, but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt,
the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and any obligations arising under any Guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such Indebtedness shall not be double counted. 
(e) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness where the Indebtedness Incurred
is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent determined on the date of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, provided, however, that if any such Indebtedness denominated in a
different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to U.S. dollars covering all principal, premium, if any, and interest payable on such 
  S-44 


Table of Contents

Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in U.S. dollars will be as provided in such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same
currency as the Indebtedness being Refinanced will be the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Indebtedness Refinanced, except to the extent that (1) such U.S. Dollar Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Agreement, in which case the
Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence, and (2) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being Refinanced, in which case the
U.S. Dollar Equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is Incurred.  (f) In no event
shall an Incurrence of Indebtedness made on the basis of consolidated financial statements prepared in good faith to be in accordance with GAAP be subject to rescission or constitute a Default by reason of any requisite subsequent restatement of
such financial statements that would have made such Incurrence prohibited at the time that it was made.  Limitation on Restricted Payments
 (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to make a Restricted Payment if
at the time the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:  (1) a Default shall have occurred and
be continuing (or would result therefrom);  (2) the Issuer is not entitled to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; or  (3) the
aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made on or after the Issue Date would exceed the sum of (without duplication): 
(A) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one accounting period) from April 1, 2011
to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ended for which internal financial statements are available prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income shall be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit); plus
 (B) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale of its Capital Stock (other
than Disqualified Stock) subsequent to April 5, 2011 (other than an issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Issuer and other than an issuance or sale to an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees) and 100% of any cash capital contribution received by the Issuer from its shareholders subsequent to the April 5, 2011; plus 
(C) the amount by which Indebtedness of the Issuer is reduced on the Issuers balance sheet upon the conversion or
exchange (other than by a Subsidiary of the Issuer) subsequent to April 5, 2011 of any Indebtedness of the Issuer convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer (less the amount of any cash, or the
fair value of any other property, distributed by the Issuer upon such conversion or exchange); plus  (D) an amount equal
to the sum of the following since April 5, 2011: (x) the net reduction in the Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any Person resulting from repurchases, repayments or
redemptions of such Investments by such Person, payments of interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or proceeds realized on the sale of such Investment and proceeds representing the return of capital, in each case
received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date, and (y) to the extent such Person is an Unrestricted Subsidiary, 
  S-45 


Table of Contents

the portion (proportionate to the Issuers equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the fair market value of the net assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted
Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that the foregoing sum in this clause (D) shall not exceed, in the case of any such Person or Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments (excluding
Permitted Investments) previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person or Unrestricted Subsidiary. 
(b) The preceding provisions will not prohibit: 
(1)(A) any Restricted Payment made out of the Net Cash Proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, or made by exchange
for, Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee stock ownership plan or to a trust established by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of their employees) subsequent to the Issue Date or (B) any Restricted Payment made out of a substantially concurrent cash capital contribution received by the Issuer from its shareholders subsequent to the Issue Date; provided,
however, that (i) such Restricted Payment shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments and (ii) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale or such cash capital contribution (to the extent so used for such
Restricted Payment) shall be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) above; 
(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated Obligations
of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Subordinated Obligations which is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described under Limitation
on Indebtedness; provided, however, that such purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(3) dividends paid within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if at such date of declaration such dividend would
have complied with this covenant; provided, however, that such dividend shall be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(4)(A) payments or distributions to employees of Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to incentive plans
designed to pay employees amounts reflecting incentive compensation in recognition of performance thresholds achieved by such employees or (B) payments or distributions to employees of Parent, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of
co-investment return, carried interest or other form of incentive compensation or performance fees or any distribution of an equity interest in respect thereof, or any other incentive distributions from Investment
Subsidiaries or Co-investment Vehicles; provided, however, that such payments or distributions shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(5) so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the repurchase or other acquisition of shares of Capital Stock of
Parent or the Issuer or any of the Issuers Subsidiaries from employees (including substantially full-time independent contractors), former employees, directors, former directors or consultants of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (or
permitted transferees of such employees, former employees, directors, former directors or consultants), pursuant to the terms of the agreements (including employment agreements) or plans (or amendments thereto) approved by the Board of Directors of
Parent or its Subsidiaries under which such individuals purchase or sell or are granted the option to purchase or sell, shares of such Capital Stock (including pursuant to any net exercise or net settlement provisions); provided, however,
that the aggregate amount of such repurchases and other acquisitions for cash shall not exceed the sum of (A) $10.0 million, (B) the Net Cash Proceeds from the sale of Capital Stock to members of management, consultants or directors of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries that occurred or occurs after April 5, 2011 (to the extent the Net Cash Proceeds from the

sale of such Capital Stock have not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by virtue of clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) above) and (C) the cash proceeds of any
key man life insurance policies that are used to make such repurchases; provided further, however, that (x) such repurchases and other acquisitions shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments and (y) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale shall be excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) above; 
(6) dividends to Parent to be used by Parent solely to pay its franchise taxes and other fees required to maintain its
corporate existence and to pay for general corporate and overhead expenses (including salaries, insurance and other compensation of the employees) incurred by Parent in the ordinary course of its business; provided, however, that such
dividends shall not exceed $5.0 million in any calendar year; provided further, however, that such dividends shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(7) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, dividends or other payments to Parent to be used by Parent
to pay dividends to the holders of the Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the Issue Date, provided, however, that the aggregate amount of such dividends or other payments shall not
exceed $8.5 million per year (provided that any unused amounts in any year continue to carry forward and increase such limit in each subsequent year); provided further, however, that such dividends or other payments shall be
excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;  (8) payments to Parent in respect of federal, state and
local taxes directly attributable to (or arising as a result of) the operations of the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the amount of such payments in any fiscal year shall not exceed the amount that the
Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would be required to pay in respect of federal, state and local taxes for such fiscal year were the Issuer to pay such taxes as a stand-alone taxpayer (whether or not all such amounts are actually used by
Parent for such purposes); provided further, however, that such payments shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(9) Investments made pursuant to commitments to Invest if at the date such commitment was made, such Investment would have

(10) upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (or similarly defined term in other Indebtedness) and within 90 days after
completion of the Fundamental Change Offer (including the purchase of all Notes tendered), any repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors
that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or to any Subsidiary Guaranty that is required to be repurchased or redeemed pursuant to the terms thereof as a result of such Change of Control (or similarly defined term in other Indebtedness), at a
purchase price not greater than 101% of the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any);

Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock) and within 90 days after completion of the Fundamental Change Offer (including the purchase of all Notes tendered), any repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement for value of Parents Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock (or any dividend or other payment to Parent for such purpose) that is required to be repurchased or redeemed pursuant to the terms thereof as

contractually subordinated to the Notes or to any Subsidiary Guaranty that is required to be repurchased or redeemed pursuant to the terms thereof as a result of such Asset Disposition (or similarly defined term in other Indebtedness), at a purchase
price not greater than 100% of the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference thereof (plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any); 
(13) the payment of any amounts in respect of Capital Stock by any Restricted Subsidiary organized as a partnership or a
limited liability company or other pass-through entity: (a) to the extent of capital contributions made to such Restricted Subsidiary (other than capital contributions made to such Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary), or (b) to the extent necessary for holders thereof to pay taxes with respect to the net income of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that except in the case of clause (b), no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time of such Restricted Payment or would result therefrom; provided, further, however, such amounts shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments; 
(14) the payment of any dividend or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer to the holders of its Capital Stock
pursuant to the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that such amounts shall be excluded in the calculation of
the amount of Restricted Payments; and  (15) Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount which, when taken together with
all Restricted Payments made pursuant to this clause (15) which have not been repaid, does not exceed the greater of (x) $37.5 million and (y) 2.0% of Total Assets; provided, however, that (A) at the time of such
Restricted Payments, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or result therefrom) and (B) such Restricted Payments shall be excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments. 
In no event shall a Restricted Payment made on the basis of consolidated financial statements prepared in good faith to be in accordance with
GAAP be subject to rescission or constitute a Default by reason of any requisite subsequent restatement of such financial statements that would have made such Restricted Payment prohibited at the time that it was made. 
For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant: (1) in the event that a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one
of the types of Restricted Payments described in the sub-clauses to clause (b) above, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such Restricted Payment at the time it is made, or later reclassify all
or a portion of such Restricted Payment, in one of the above sub-clauses in any manner that complies with the covenant; and (2) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify a Restricted Payment in more than one of the types of Restricted
Payments described in the sub-clauses to clause (b) above.  As of March 18, 2014, the sum of the amounts referred to in
paragraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D) of clause (a)(3) above was approximately $753.0 million.  Limitation on Restrictions on
Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries  The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or
otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted

Subsidiary to (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer, (b) make any
loans or advances to the Issuer or (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer, except:  (1) with respect to clauses
(a), (b) and (c),  (A) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;  (B) any encumbrance or restriction contained in the terms of
any agreement pursuant to which such Indebtedness was issued if (x) either (i) the encumbrance or restriction applies only in the event of and during the continuance of a payment default or a covenant default contained in such Indebtedness
or agreement or (ii) the Issuer determines at the time any such Indebtedness is Incurred (and at the time of any modification of the terms of any such encumbrance or restriction) that any such encumbrance or restriction will not materially
affect the Issuers ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes and (y) the encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable financings or
agreements (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith);  (C) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a
Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement relating to any Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary on or prior to the date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Issuer (other than Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired

(B) or (C) of clause (1) of this covenant or this clause (D); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such refinancing agreement or amendment are not
materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the noteholders than encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in such predecessor agreements;

of the borrower) under any Non-Recourse Indebtedness or of any Co-investment Vehicle;  (G) any encumbrance or restriction
contained in the terms of any agreement governing Indebtedness directly or indirectly secured by real property or other related assets that are customary for real property financing transactions, such as cash collateral accounts or impounds or

(2) with respect to clause (c) only, 
(A) any such encumbrance or restriction consisting of customary nonassignment provisions in leases governing leasehold
interests or licenses of intellectual property to the extent such provisions restrict the transfer of the lease or the property leased or licensed thereunder; 
(B) restrictions contained in security agreements, mortgages or other agreements securing Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary or any agreement governing Non-Recourse Indebtedness to the extent such restrictions restrict the transfer of the property subject to such security agreements, mortgages or Non-Recourse Indebtedness; 
(C) restrictions on the transfer of assets subject to any Lien permitted under the Indenture imposed by the holder of such
Lien;  (D) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary or its assets imposed pursuant to an agreement entered
into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition; and 
(E) arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually
or in the aggregate, detract from the value of the property or assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a manner material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. 
Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock 
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless:
 (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal
to the fair market value (including as to the value of all noncash consideration), as determined in good faith by members of the Issuers senior management, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition; 
(2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or
cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments or Replacement Assets or a combination of cash and cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, and Replacement Assets; provided, however, that with respect to the sale of one or more real estate
properties or related property, plant and equipment, or loans secured by real estate, up to 75% of the consideration may consist of Indebtedness of the purchaser of such real estate properties or related property, plant and equipment, or loans
secured by real estate, so long as such Indebtedness is secured by a first or second priority Lien on the real estate property or properties or related property, plant and equipment, or loans secured by real estate, sold; 
(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Issuer (or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be):  (A) first, to the extent the Issuer elects (or is required by the terms of any
Indebtedness), to prepay, repay, redeem or purchase secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness (other than Disqualified Stock) of any other Wholly Owned Subsidiary (in each case other than Indebtedness owed to
the Issuer or an Affiliate of 
  S-50 


Table of Contents

the Issuer) within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; 
(B) second, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with clause (A), to the
extent the Issuer elects, to make a capital expenditure or to acquire Replacement Assets within one year from the later of the date of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash; and 
(C) third, to the extent of the Excess Proceeds (as defined below), to make an offer to the holders of the Notes (and to
holders of other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer designated by the Issuer) to purchase Notes (and such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to and subject to the conditions contained in the Indenture; 
provided, however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (A) or
(C) above (excluding temporary reductions of revolving credit indebtedness made pursuant to the covenant described in the last sentence of the next paragraph), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall permanently retire such Indebtedness
and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; provided further, however, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with
clause (B) above if and to the extent that, within 365 days after the later of the Asset Disposition or the receipt of Net Available Cash, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding
agreement to make a capital expenditure or to acquire Replacement Assets, and that such capital expenditure or acquisition is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 365-day period. 
The Net Available Cash of an Asset Disposition not applied pursuant to clauses (3)(A) and (B) above constitute Excess
Proceeds. Excess Proceeds of less than $10.0 million will be carried forward and accumulated. When accumulated Excess Proceeds equal or exceed such amount, the Issuer must, within 30 days, make an offer to purchase the Notes, in
accordance with clause (3)(C) above. Pending application of Net Available Cash pursuant to this covenant, such Net Available Cash shall be invested in Temporary Cash Investments or applied to temporarily reduce revolving credit indebtedness.
 For the purposes of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash or cash equivalents: 
(1) the assumption of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; and  (2) securities received
by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash within 180 days of receipt. 
(b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to clause
(a)(3)(C) above, the Issuer will purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Issuer for the Notes (and such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) at a purchase price of 100% of their principal amount (or, in the event such other Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer was issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), without premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, (or, in respect of such other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, such
lesser price, if any, as may be provided for by the terms of such Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price
of the securities tendered exceeds the Net Available Cash allotted to their purchase, the Issuer will select the securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis but in round denominations, which in the case of the Notes will be denominations of
$2,000 principal amount or integral multiples of $1,000 greater thereof. The Issuer shall not be 
  S-51 


Table of Contents

required to make such an offer to purchase Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer) pursuant to this covenant if the Excess Proceeds are less than $5.0 million (which lesser amount
shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether such an offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). 
(c) The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this clause by virtue of its compliance with such securities laws or regulations. 
Limitation on Affiliate Transactions 
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into or permit to exist any transaction (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property, employee compensation arrangements or the rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (an Affiliate Transaction) unless: 
(1) the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that
could be obtained at the time of the Affiliate Transaction in arms-length dealings with a Person who is not an Affiliate; 
(2) if such Affiliate Transaction involves an amount in excess of $25.0 million, the terms of the Affiliate Transaction
are set forth in writing and a majority of the directors of the Issuer disinterested with respect to such Affiliate Transaction have determined in good faith that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied and have approved the relevant
Affiliate Transaction as evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors; and  (3) if such Affiliate Transaction
involves an amount in excess of $50.0 million, the Board of Directors shall also have received a written opinion from an Independent Qualified Party to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction is fair, from a financial standpoint, to the
Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or is not less favorable to the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at the time in an arms-length transaction with a Person who was not
an Affiliate.  (b) The provisions of the preceding paragraph (a) will not prohibit: 
(1) any Investment or other Restricted Payment, in each case not prohibited pursuant to the covenant described under
Limitation on Restricted Payments;  (2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants
in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock options and stock ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors; 
(3) loans or advances to employees or consultants in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries;  (4) the payment of reasonable fees and compensation to, or the provision of employee benefit arrangements
and indemnity for the benefit of, directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; 
  S-52 


Table of Contents
(5) any transaction between or among the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary, any
Co-investment Vehicle or joint venture or similar entity (including any separate account or investment program managed, operated or sponsored by an Investment Subsidiary) which would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Restricted Subsidiary, Co-investment Vehicle, joint venture or similar entity (including any separate account or investment program managed, operated or sponsored by an
Investment Subsidiary);  (6) the issuance or sale of any Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or
Parent;  (7) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) or warrant agreement to which it is a party as of the Issue Date and any similar agreements which it may enter into
thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement
entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the noteholders in any material respect; 
(8) any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date and described or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement or
the accompanying prospectus, or any renewals, extensions or amendments of any such agreement (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced
thereby;  (9) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services in each case
in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the applicable Indenture which are fair to the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the
senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; and 
(10) the repurchase or other acquisition of the Parents warrants outstanding as of the Issue Date, pursuant to the terms
of a plan (or amendment thereto) approved by the Board of Directors of Parent.  Limitation on Liens 
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, Incur or permit to exist any Lien (the
Initial Lien) of any nature whatsoever on any of its properties (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Issue Date or thereafter acquired, securing any Obligations, other than Permitted
Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes (or a Subsidiary Guaranty in the case of an Initial Lien of a Subsidiary Guarantor) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, in the event the Lien related to Subordinated Obligations, prior
to) the Obligations so secured for so long as such Obligations are so secured. Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien.  Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions 
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with respect to any property
unless:  (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to (A) Incur Indebtedness in an amount equal to the
Attributable Debt with respect to such Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to the covenant 
  S-53 


Table of Contents

described under Limitation on Indebtedness and (B) create a Lien on such property securing such Attributable Debt without equally and ratably securing the Notes pursuant to
the covenant described under Limitation on Liens;  (2) the net proceeds received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with such Sale/ Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the fair value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer) of such property; and 
(3) the Issuer applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with the covenant described under Limitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.  Merger and Consolidation 
The provisions described below apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under
the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesConsolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related guaranties
issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:  (1) the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the Successor Company) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor
Company (if not the Issuer) shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental thereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture; 
(2) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the Successor
Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by such Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; 
(3) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur an additional $1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (a) of the covenant described under Limitation on Indebtedness; and  (4) the
Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; 
provided, however, that clause (3) will not be applicable to (A) a Restricted Subsidiary consolidating with, merging into or transferring all
or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or (B) the Issuer merging with an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose and with the sole effect of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction. 
The Successor Company will be the successor to the Issuer and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture, and the predecessor Issuer, except in the case of a lease, shall be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes. 
The Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless:

Table of Contents
(1) except in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor that has been disposed of in its entirety to
another Person (other than to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer), whether through a merger, consolidation or sale of Capital Stock or assets, if in connection therewith the Issuer provides an Officers Certificate to the Trustee stating
that the Issuer will comply with its obligations under the covenant described under Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock in respect of such disposition, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not such
Subsidiary) shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the jurisdiction under which such Subsidiary was organized or under the laws of the United States of America, or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person
shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, all the obligations of such Subsidiary, if any, under its Subsidiary Guaranty;  (2)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been
issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and  (3) the Issuer delivers to
the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with the Indenture. 
Parent will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or
substantially all of its assets to any Person unless:  (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not Parent) shall be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person shall expressly assume, by a Guaranty Agreement, all the obligations of Parent, if any, under its Guaranty; 
(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or transactions on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the resulting, surviving or transferee Person as a result of such transaction as having been issued by such Person at the time of such transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and 
(3) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger
or transfer and such Guaranty Agreement, if any, complies with the Indenture.  Future Guarantors 
On the Issue Date, Parent and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors will execute and deliver the Supplemental Indenture agreeing to fully and
unconditionally Guarantee the Notes on an unsecured, senior basis. After the Issue Date, the Issuer will cause each domestic Restricted Subsidiary (other than (i) any Excluded Subsidiary and (ii) Restricted Subsidiary prohibited from
providing a Guarantee by any agreement governing Non-Recourse Indebtedness (or the terms of the relevant partnership agreement, limited liability company operating agreement or other governing document of the entity that is the borrower (or the
direct parent of the borrower) under any Non-Recourse Indebtedness), any joint venture agreement or the terms of any Co-investment Vehicle or any separate account or investment program managed, operated or sponsored by an Investment Subsidiary) to
execute and deliver to the Trustee a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to which such domestic Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture. 
Not all of our subsidiaries that acquire properties or other assets in the future will become guarantors of the Notes. For example, the terms
of the Non-Recourse Indebtedness agreements, partnership agreements, limited liability company operating agreements, other governing documents, joint venture agreements, Co-investment Vehicles, separate accounts and investment programs referred to
above may prohibit the relevant subsidiary from guaranteeing the Notes. In many cases, the Indenture does not require these subsidiaries to 
  S-55 


Table of Contents

guarantee the Notes. Accordingly, noteholders will not have a direct claim against these subsidiaries for payments on the Notes. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to the NotesThe
notes will not be guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries.  SEC Reports 
Notwithstanding that the Issuer may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the
Issuer will file with the SEC and make available to the Trustee and noteholders and deliver a copy to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the SEC such annual reports and such information, documents and other reports as are specified
in Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act and applicable to a U.S. corporation subject to such Sections, such information, documents and other reports to be so filed with the SEC at the times specified for the filings of such information,
documents and reports under such Sections; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be so obligated to file such reports with the SEC if the SEC does not permit such filing, in which event the Issuer will make available such
information to noteholders and deliver a copy to the Trustee within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to file such information with the SEC if it were subject to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided
further, however, that (a) so long as Parent is the Guarantor of the Notes, the reports, information and other documents required to be filed and provided as described hereunder may, at the Issuers option, be filed by and be
those of Parent rather than the Issuer and (b) in the event that Parent conducts any business or holds any significant assets other than the capital stock of the Issuer at the time of filing and providing any such report, information or other
document containing financial statements of Parent, Parent shall include in such report, information or other document summarized financial information (as defined in Rule 1-02(bb) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC) with respect to the
Issuer; provided further, however, that in no event shall the Issuer or Parent be required to make available to the Trustee or noteholders any material for which the Issuer or Parent is seeking, or has received, confidential treatment
by the SEC, or any correspondence with the SEC or its staff. For purposes of this covenant, reports, information and documents publicly available on the SECs EDGAR system (or any successor thereto) shall be deemed to be available to the
Trustee and noteholders.  Defaults 
The provisions described below apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under
the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesEvents of Default. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related guaranties issued pursuant to the Base
Indenture.  Each of the following is an Event of Default: 
(1) a default in the payment of interest on the Notes when due, continued for 30 days; 
(2) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon redemption, upon required purchase, upon
declaration of acceleration or otherwise;  (3) the failure by the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply with its
obligations under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation;  (4) the failure by the Issuer, Parent or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, to comply for 60 days after receipt of written notice with any of its agreements contained in the Indenture (other than any other agreement specifically referred to in any of the other clauses of this
definition of Event of Default), including its obligations in the covenants described above under Fundamental Change (other than a failure to purchase Notes), Certain CovenantsLimitation on Indebtedness,
Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restricted Payments, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock (other than a failure to purchase 
  S-56 


Table of Contents

Notes), Certain CovenantsLimitation on Affiliate Transactions, Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens, Certain CovenantsLimitation
on Sale/Leaseback Transactions or Certain CovenantsFuture Guarantors;  (5) the failure by the Issuer or
Parent, as the case may be, to comply for 180 days after receipt of written notice with any of its obligations in the covenant described above under Certain CovenantsSEC Reports (provided that, if applicable, failure
by the Issuer or Parent to comply with the provisions of Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act will not in itself be deemed a Default or an Event of Default under the Indenture); 
(6)(a) Indebtedness (other than Non-Recourse Indebtedness) of the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary is not paid
within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default and the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds $30.0 million or (b) three or more unrelated instances
at any one time where Non-Recourse Indebtedness of the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary is not paid within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a default
and the aggregate amount of such Non-Recourse Indebtedness that remains unpaid or accelerated exceeds the greater of (i) $200.0 million and (ii) 10% of Total Assets (clauses (a) and (b), together, the cross acceleration
provision);  (7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any
Significant Subsidiary (the bankruptcy provisions);  (8) any final judgment or decree for the payment of money
(other than judgments which are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent carriers) in excess of $20.0 million is entered against the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any Significant Subsidiary, remains outstanding for a period
of 60 consecutive days following such judgment becoming final and is not discharged, waived or stayed within 10 days after notice (the judgment default provision); or 
(9) the Parent Guaranty or a Subsidiary Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Guaranty) or a Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guaranty.  However, a default under clause (4), (5) or
(8) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee notifies the Issuer or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer with a copy to the Trustee of the default in writing and the Issuer does not
cure such default within the time specified after receipt of such notice. In the event of any Event of Default specified under clause (6), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a
result of acceleration of Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (a) holders thereof have rescinded or waived the
acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (b) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt securities under the Base Indenture (except as to certain events of
bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities under the Base Indenture. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the Indenture
may constitute an event of default under certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time. 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest on all the Notes will ipso facto become and be 
  S-57 


Table of Contents

immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders of the Notes. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences.  In case an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders of the Notes unless such holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:  (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
 (2) holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 
(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; 
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and 
(5) holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.  Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, holders of the Notes will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive
payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Notes on or after the due dates expressed in the Indenture and the Notes and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment. 
If a Default occurs, is continuing and the Trustee has received notice thereof, the Trustee must mail to each holder of the Notes notice of
the Default within 90 days after the Trustee receives such notice. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its trust officers determines
that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the holders of the Notes. In addition, we are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know
of any Default that occurred during the previous year. We are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action we are

Indenture or any debt security (other than the Notes) of a series established pursuant to the Base Indenture may be amended in the manner set forth in the accompanying prospectus under the heading Description of Debt
SecuritiesModification and Waiver. However, an amendment to the Base Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties that amends, supplements or modifies the terms of the

  S-58 


Table of Contents

Supplemental Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties must satisfy the provisions described in this Amendments and Waivers section in lieu of the provisions described in the
accompanying prospectus under the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesModification and Waiver. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt securities or related
guaranties issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended with the consent of the
holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for the Notes) and any past default or compliance with any provisions may also be waived with the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. However, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby, an amendment or waiver may not, among other things: 
(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment; 
(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note; 
(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note; 
(4) reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note may be redeemed as described under
Optional Redemption;  (5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes; 
(6) impair the right of any holder of the Notes to receive payment of principal of and interest on such holders Notes on or after the
due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holders Notes;  (7) make any
change in the amendment provisions which require each holders consent or in the waiver provisions;  (8) make any change in the
ranking or priority of any Note or Guaranty that would adversely affect the noteholders; or  (9) voluntarily release a Subsidiary
Guarantor other than in accordance with the Indenture.  Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of the Notes, the
Issuer, Parent, the Subsidiary Guarantors and Trustee may amend the Indenture:  (1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency;  (2) to provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary
Guarantor under the Indenture;  (3) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code);  (4) to add guarantees with
respect to the Notes, including any Subsidiary Guaranties, or to secure the Notes;  (5) to add to the covenants of the Issuer, Parent or
any Subsidiary Guarantor for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer, Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor; 
  S-59 


Table of Contents
(6) to make any change that does not materially adversely affect the rights of any holder of the
Notes;  (7) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with any required qualification of the Indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act;  (8) to conform the text of the Indenture, Guaranties or the Notes to any provision of this Description of the
Notes to the extent that such provision was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Guaranties or the Notes as certified in an Officers Certificate delivered to the Trustee; or 
(9) to amend the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes; provided, however, that
(i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of
holders to transfer Notes, except as required by law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the lenders under the Credit Agreement have the
right to consent to any amendment, supplement or other modification of the Indenture or any other change relating to the Notes that occurs after the Issue Date if such amendments, supplements or changes would have a material adverse effect on the
Issuers ability to repay its obligations under the Credit Agreement.  The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under
the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. 
After an amendment under the Indenture becomes effective, we are required to deliver electronically, if held at DTC, or mail to holders of the
Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all holders of the Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment. 
Neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of the Issuer may, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of
interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to all holders and is paid to all holders that
so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.  Transfer
 The Notes will be issued in registered form and will be transferable only upon the surrender of the Notes being transferred for
registration of transfer. We may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection with certain transfers and exchanges. 
Defeasance and Satisfaction and Discharge 
The provisions described below apply to the Notes and the Guaranties in lieu of the provisions described in the accompanying prospectus under
the heading Description of Debt SecuritiesDefeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances. The provisions described below apply only to the Notes and the Guaranties and not to any other series of debt
securities or related guaranties issued pursuant to the Base Indenture.  At any time, we may terminate all our and each Guarantors
obligations with respect to the Notes or the Guaranties under the Notes, the Guaranties and the Indenture (legal defeasance), except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations
to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes, 
  S-60 


Table of Contents

to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes. 
In addition, at any time we may terminate our obligations under Fundamental Change and under the covenants described under
Certain Covenants (other than the covenant described under Merger and Consolidation), the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries and the
judgment default provision described under Defaults above and the limitations contained in clause (3) of the first paragraph under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation above and our
Guarantors obligations under the Guaranties and the Indenture (covenant defeasance).  We may exercise our
legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant defeasance option. If we exercise our legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If we exercise
our covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4), (5), (7), (8) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or (9) under Defaults above
or because of the failure of the Issuer to comply with clause (3) of the first paragraph under Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation above. If we exercise our legal defeasance option or our covenant defeasance
option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guaranty.  In order to exercise either of our
defeasance options, we must irrevocably deposit in trust (the defeasance trust) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the
case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable federal income tax law). 
In addition, the Issuers obligations under the Notes and with respect to the Notes under the Indenture, and each Guarantors
obligations under its Guaranty, will terminate (a satisfaction and discharge), subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, if: 
(1) all Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than (i) destroyed, lost or stolen Notes that have been replaced or
(ii) Notes that are paid or (iii) Notes for whose payment money or U.S. Government Obligations have been held in trust and then repaid to the Issuer in accordance with the Indenture) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
and the Issuer has paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; or  (2) (A) the Notes mature within 60 days, or all of them are to be
called for redemption within 60 days under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for giving the notice of redemption, 
(B) the Issuer irrevocably deposits in trust with the Trustee, as trust funds solely for the benefit of the holders, money or
U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certificate delivered to the Trustee, without consideration of any reinvestment,
to pay principal of and interest on the Notes to maturity or redemption, as the case may be, and to pay all other sums payable by it hereunder, 
(C) no Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit, 
(D) the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Indenture or any other
agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound, and 
  S-61 


Table of Contents
(E) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Officers Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. 
Concerning the Trustee  Wilmington
Trust, National Association is to be the Trustee under the Indenture. We have appointed Wilmington Trust, National Association as Registrar and Paying Agent with regard to the Notes. 
The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment
of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; provided, however, if it acquires any
conflicting interest and the Notes are in default, it must either eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign. 
Subject to certain rights of the Trustee, holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. If an Event of Default occurs (and is not cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to
use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of such persons affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder
shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.  No Personal Liability of
Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders  No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or stockholder or control person
of the Issuer, the Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, the Parent or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes, any Guaranty or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver and release may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy. 
Governing Law  The Indenture, the Notes
and the Guaranties, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the Notes or the Guaranties, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other
than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).  Certain Definitions

shall be deemed to have been satisfied in respect of any agreement as in effect on the Issue Date or any renewals, extension or amendments of any such agreements (so long as such renewals, extensions or amendments are not less favorable to the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) and the transactions evidenced thereby.  Asset Disposition means any sale,
lease, transfer or other disposition (or series of related sales, leases, transfers or dispositions) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any disposition by means of a merger, consolidation or similar transaction (each referred to

assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole will be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption Fundamental Change and/or the provisions described above under the caption
Certain CovenantsMerger and Consolidation and not by the provisions described above under the caption Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock covenant.

provided, however, that if such Sale/Leaseback Transaction results in a Capital Lease Obligation, the amount of Indebtedness represented thereby will be determined in accordance with the definition of Capital Lease
Obligation.  Average Life means, as of the date of determination, with respect to any Indebtedness, the quotient
obtained by dividing:  (1) the sum of the products of the number of years from the date of determination to the dates of each successive

terminated by the lessee without payment of a penalty. For purposes of the covenant described under Certain CovenantsLimitation on Liens, a Capital Lease Obligation will be deemed to be secured by a Lien on the property being
leased. For the avoidance of doubt, Capital Lease Obligations will not include ground leases of real property entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries. 
Capital Stock of any Person means any and all shares, interests, rights to purchase, warrants, options, participations or

Subsidiary, except that, subject to the exclusion contained in clause (h) below, the aggregate amount of cash actually distributed by such Person to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as a dividend or other distribution (subject, in the case
of a dividend or other distribution paid to another Restricted Subsidiary, to the limitation contained in clause (a) above) shall be included in determining Consolidated Net Income,

provided further, however, that Consolidated Net Income for any period shall be increased (i) by cash received during such period by the
Issuer or any of its consolidated subsidiaries in respect of commissions receivable (net of related commissions payable to brokers) on transactions that were completed by any acquired business prior to the acquisition of such business and which
purchase accounting rules under GAAP would require to be recognized as an intangible asset purchased, (ii) increased, to the extent otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period, by the amortization of intangibles
relating to purchase accounting in connection with any acquisition permitted by the Indenture and (iii) increased (or decreased, as the case may be), in connection with the sale of real estate during such period, to eliminate the effect of

is issued to any employee or to any plan for the benefit of employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries or by any such plan to such employees, such Capital Stock shall not constitute Disqualified Stock solely because it may be required to be repurchased

provisions thereof giving holders thereof the right to require such Person to purchase or redeem such Capital Stock upon the occurrence of an asset sale, change of control or termination of trading occurring prior

Certain CovenantsLimitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock and Fundamental Change; and

GAAP means generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America as in effect from time to time,
provided, however, that GAAP shall mean the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America as in effect as of April 5, 2011 in the event of a change in GAAP after April 5, 2011 that would have a material adverse
(including, without limitation, the treatment of an operating lease as Indebtedness) or positive effect on the Issuer, including those set forth in: 
(1) the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; 
(2) statements and pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board; 
(3) such other statements by such other entity as approved by a significant segment of the accounting profession; and 
(4) the rules and regulations of the SEC governing the inclusion of financial statements (including pro forma financial statements) in

(1) the principal in respect of (A) indebtedness of such Person for money borrowed and (B) indebtedness evidenced by notes,

payment depends on the performance of such business after the closing; provided, however, that, at the time of closing, the amount of any such payment is not determinable and, to the extent such payment thereafter becomes fixed and
determined, the amount is paid within 60 days thereafter. Indebtedness of any Person shall include all Indebtedness of any partnership or other entity in which such Person is a general partner or other equity holder with unlimited liability other

The Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons (collectively,

case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below.  Except as set forth below, the
Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for Notes in certificated form except in the limited
circumstances described below. See Book-Entry, Delivery and FormExchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not
be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form.  Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants, which may change from time to time.

Depository Procedures 
The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and
procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly
to discuss these matters.  DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating
organizations (collectively, the Participants) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants.
The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the underwriters of the Notes), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTCs system is also available to other entities such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the Indirect Participants). Persons who are not
Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are
recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.  DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established
by it:  (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the underwriters of the Notes
with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and  (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and
the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
the Global Notes).  Investors in the Global Notes who are Participants in DTCs system may hold their interests therein directly
through DTC. Investors in the Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations that are Participants in such system. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and
requirements of DTC. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be
limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not
participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests. 
Except as described below, owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical
delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture for any purpose. 
Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest, if any, on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable
to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names the Notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the Notes
for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: 
(1) any aspect of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to or payments made on account
of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising 
  S-84 


Table of Contents

or reviewing any of DTCs records or any Participants or Indirect Participants records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or 
(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. 
DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and
interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount
proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed
by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable
for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.
 Transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTCs procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds.
 DTC has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more
Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction.
However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Notes to its Participants. 
Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, DTC is
under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC or its direct or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 
Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes 
A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if: 
(1) DTC (a) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and DTC fails to appoint a
successor depositary or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act;  (2) the Issuer, at its option,
notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of the Certificated Notes; or  (3) there has occurred and is
continuing a Default with respect to the Notes and the Trustee has received a request from DTC to issue certificated notes.  In addition,
beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes under prior written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any
Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be 
  S-85 


Table of Contents

registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary procedures). 
Same Day Settlement and Payment 
The Issuer will make payments in respect of the Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal and interest, if any) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note holder. The Issuer will make all payments of principal and interest, if any, with respect to Certificated Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by the holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holders registered address. The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to trade in DTCs
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any Certificated Notes
will also be settled in immediately available funds.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and
disposition of the notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or
foreign tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative
pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be
applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a
contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.  This
discussion is limited to holders who hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the notes
for cash at original issue and at their original issue price within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not
address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holders particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders
subject to special rules, including, without limitation:   


 

 
U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;   


 

 
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;   


 

 
U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;   


 

 
persons holding the notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; 
 


 

 
banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;   


 

 
real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;   


 

 
brokers, dealers or traders in securities;   


 

 
controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; 
 


 

 
S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); 
 


 

 
tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and   


 

 
persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.  If an
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at
the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR
NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.  Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. Holders 
Definition of a U.S. Holder  For
purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of a note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as:   


 

 
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;   


 

 
a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;   


 

 
an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or   


 

 
a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has
a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Payments of Interest
 Interest on a note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or
accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holders method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.  Certain Additional Payments 
In certain circumstances (see Description of the NotesOptional Redemption and Description of the
NotesFundamental Change), we may be obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the principal amount of the notes. We intend to take the position that the notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments
because of these additional payments. This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the notes, that such additional payments will have to be made. Assuming this position is respected, any
amounts paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to any such redemption or repurchase, as applicable, would be taxable as described below in Tax Considerations Applicable to U.S. HoldersSale or Other Taxable Disposition. Our position
is binding on a U.S. Holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to our position, which could affect the timing and character of
a U.S. Holders income and the timing of our deductions with respect to the notes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes and the
consequences thereof. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.  Sale or Other
Taxable Disposition  A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a note. The amount of such gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount 
  S-88 


Table of Contents

received for the note in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not
previously included in income) and the U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holders adjusted tax basis in a note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder paid for the note. Any gain or loss will be capital
gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the note for more than one year at the time of sale or other taxable disposition. Otherwise, such gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term
capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on a note or receives proceeds
from the sale or other taxable disposition of a note (including a redemption or retirement of a note). Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be
subject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and such holder:   


 

 
fails to furnish the holders taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number; 
 


 

 
furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;   


 

 
is notified by the IRS that the holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or   


 

 
fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified the holder that the holder is subject to backup withholding.
 Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a
refund or a credit against a U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for an exemption from
backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.  Tax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders 
Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder 
For purposes of this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of a note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor an entity
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Payments of Interest 
Interest paid on a note to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business
within the United States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, or withholding tax of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), provided that: 
 


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock; 
 


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us through actual or constructive stock ownership; and 
  S-89 


Table of Contents


 

 
either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person and provides its name and address; (2) a
securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the note on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder certifies to the applicable withholding
agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the Non-U.S. Holder, has received from the Non-U.S. Holder a statement under penalties of perjury that such holder is not a United States person and provides a
copy of such statement to the applicable withholding agent; or (3) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its note directly through a qualified intermediary (within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations) and certain conditions are
satisfied.  If a Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the requirements above, such Non-U.S. Holder may be entitled to a
reduction in or an exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty. To claim such entitlement, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN claiming a
reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established. 
If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the
United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such interest is attributable), the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal
withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States.  Any such effectively
connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an
applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected interest, as adjusted for certain items.  The certifications described above
must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify
for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their
entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.  Sale or Other Taxable Disposition 
A Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a note (such amount excludes any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest and may be subject to the rules discussed above in Tax Considerations Applicable to
Non-U.S. HoldersPayments of Interest) unless:   


 

 
the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent
establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or   


 

 
the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met. 
Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular
graduated rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation also may be 
  S-90 


Table of Contents

subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items. 
Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by
an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal
income tax returns with respect to such losses.  Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax
treaties that may provide for different rules.  Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
Payments of interest generally will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual
knowledge or reason to know the holder is a United States person and the holder certifies its non-U.S. status as described above under Tax Considerations Applicable to Non-U.S. HoldersPayments of Interest. However,
information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any interest paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of a note
(including a retirement or redemption of the note) within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, if the applicable withholding agent receives
the statement described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of a note paid outside the United States and
conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, unless the broker has certain connections to the United States. 
Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement
to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.  Backup withholding is not an additional
tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS 
The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes by (a) employee benefit plans
that are subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), (b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code (the Code) or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws, rules or regulations that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, Similar Laws), and (c) entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include plan assets (within the meaning of ERISA) of any such plan, account or arrangement by reason of a plans investment in such entities (each of (a), (b) and (c), a Plan).
 General Fiduciary Matters  ERISA
and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an ERISA Plan) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its
fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or
who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA). 
In considering an investment in the notes with any portion of the assets of a Plan, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consider, among other
matters, whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any applicable Similar Law relating to a fiduciarys duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. 
Prohibited Transaction Considerations 
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan
assets with persons or entities who are parties in interest, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA, or disqualified persons, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan, who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and the Code. Plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar prohibitions under other applicable Similar Laws. 
The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, a guarantor or any of the underwriters of the
outstanding notes, or certain of our or their affiliates, are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA
and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or comparable provisions of Similar Laws), unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (PTCEs) that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/ or holding of the notes. These
class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 for transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 for transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 for transactions
involving bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 for transactions involving life insurance company general accounts and 
  S-92 


Table of Contents

PTCE 96-23 for transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption from the prohibited
transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain purchases and sales of securities, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or
exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction, and provided further that the ERISA Plan receives no less, and pays no more, than adequate
consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. 
Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such
purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and will not constitute a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. 
Representation  Accordingly, by
purchasing and holding notes, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) it is not a Plan, and no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire and hold the
notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) neither the purchase nor the holding of the notes by such purchaser or subsequent transferee will result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.  The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to
be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering whether to purchase
the notes (or hold or dispose of the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transaction and whether
an exemption would be applicable to such transaction. Investors in the notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase of the notes does not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any
similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any notes by or to any Plan is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments
by such Plans generally or with respect to any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for such Plans generally or for any particular Plan.

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the underwriting agreement if any of these notes are purchased. If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting
underwriters may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.  We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters and their
control persons against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. 
The underwriters are offering the notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal
matters by their counsel, including the validity of the notes, and other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriters of officers certificates and legal opinions. The underwriters reserve the
right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.  Commissions and Discounts 
The representatives have advised us that the underwriters propose initially to offer the notes to the public at the public offering price set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement. After the initial offering, the public offering price, discount or any other term of the offering may be changed. The underwriters may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.
 The following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions per $1,000 principal amount of notes and the total underwriting
discounts and commissions:

 We estimate that the expenses of the offering payable by us, not including the underwriting discounts and
commissions, will be approximately $500,000.  Settlement 
We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about March 25, 2014, which will be the fourth business day
following the date of this prospectus supplement (such settlement being referred to as 
  S-94 


Table of Contents

T+4). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), trades in the secondary market are required, subject to certain
exceptions, to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to sell their notes before the third business day prior to the delivery of the notes hereunder will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+4, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Those purchasers should consult their advisors. 
New Issue of Notes  The notes are a new
issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of
the underwriters that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the offering. However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot
assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from
their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. 
No Sales of Similar Securities  Each of
Kennedy-Wilson Inc. and Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and the other guarantors has agreed that, for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement, it will not, without first obtaining the prior written consent of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or establish a put equivalent position (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act),
or otherwise dispose of, or announce the offering of, or file a registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt securities of Kennedy Wilson, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings or any other guarantor of the notes or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into such debt securities, except as contemplated by the underwriting agreement.  Short Positions 
In connection with this offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell the notes in the open market. These transactions may include short
sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriter of a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The underwriters may close
out a short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could
adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.  Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters purchases to
cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that
might otherwise exist in the open market.  Neither we nor any of the underwriters makes any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the underwriters makes any representation that the underwriters will engage in these transactions or
that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

Electronic Distribution 
In connection with the offering, certain of the underwriters or securities dealers may distribute this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus by electronic means, such as e-mail.  Conflicts of Interest 
We expect to use more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering to repay our outstanding indebtedness to U.S. Bank National Association, an
affiliate of U.S. Bancorp Investments Inc., under our revolving loan agreement dated as of August 5, 2010, as amended, under which U.S. Bank National Association acts as the administrative agent, lead arranger and book manager and is a lender.
For this reason, a conflict of interest is deemed to exist under Rule 5121 of the FINRA. Accordingly, the offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. In addition, in accordance with Rule 5121,
U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. will not make sales to discretionary accounts without the prior written consent of the customer.  Other Relationships
 Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, commercial
lending and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the underwriters or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, we have been advised that they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, the underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions, which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 
Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area 
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area (each, a Relevant Member State), no offer of notes may be made to
the public in that Relevant Member State other than:   


 
A.
to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;   


 
B.
to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus

C.
in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,  provided
that no such offer of notes shall require us or the representatives to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive. 
This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Relevant Member

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
Statements made by in this prospectus and in other reports and statements released by either issuer that are not historical facts constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21 of the Securities Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are necessary estimates reflecting the judgment of senior
management based on current estimates, expectations, forecasts and projections and include comments that express current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Disclosures that use words such as
believe, anticipate, estimate, intend, could, plan, expect, project or the negative of these, as well as similar expressions, are intended to identify
forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, rely on a number of assumptions
concerning future events, many of which are outside of the issuers control, and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or achievement, or industry results, to differ materially from any
future results, performance or achievements, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although the issuers believe that their plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those
forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). In evaluating these statements, you should specifically consider the risks
referred to under the heading Risk Factors on page 1 of this prospectus, and in the reports Kennedy-Wilson Holdings files from time to time with the SEC and incorporates by reference herein, including, but not limited to, the following
factors:

disruptions in general economic and business conditions, particularly in geographies where the issuers respective businesses may be concentrated; 
 


 

 
the continued volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, higher interest rates, higher loan costs, less desirable loan terms and a reduction in the availability of mortgage loans and mezzanine
financing, all of which could increase costs and could limit the issuers ability to acquire additional real estate assets;   


 

 
continued high levels of, or increases in, unemployment and general slowdowns in commercial activity;   


 

 
the issuers leverage and ability to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness;   


 

 
an increase in the issuers debt service obligations;   


 

 
the issuers ability to generate a sufficient amount of cash from operations to satisfy working capital requirements and to service their existing and future indebtedness; 
 


 

 
the issuers ability to achieve improvements in operating efficiency;   


 

 
foreign currency fluctuations;   


 

 
adverse changes in the securities markets;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain their senior management and attract and retain qualified and experienced employees;   


 

 
the issuers ability to attract new user and investor clients;   


 

 
the issuers ability to retain major clients and renew related contracts;   


 

 
trends in use of large, full-service commercial real estate providers;   


 

 
changes in tax laws in the United States, Europe or Japan that reduce or eliminate deductions or other tax benefits the issuers receive; 
 


 

 
future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions; and   


 

 
costs relating to the acquisition of assets the issuers may acquire could be higher than anticipated.

 The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed charges, as
defined. For this purpose, earnings consist of pretax income from continuing operations before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of joint ventures plus operating distributions from equity investees, and fixed
charges consists of interest expense, whether capitalized or expensed, amortization related to indebtedness and premiums or discounts of stock issuances and an estimate of interest expense within rental expense. For the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2009, and 2008, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges, and the deficiency of earnings was $6.5 million, $21.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively. 
The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is calculated by dividing earnings, as defined, by fixed
charges, as defined. For this purpose, earnings and fixed charges have the respective meanings assigned above. Preferred stock dividends refers to preferred dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries. For
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2009 and 2008, Kennedy-Wilson Holdings earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, and the deficiency of earnings was $15.3 million, $21.1 million and $9.5 million,
respectively.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Our second amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizes the issuance of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. As of October 30, 2013, 81,413,679 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock have exclusive voting rights for the
election of our directors and all other matters requiring stockholder action, except with respect to amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that alter or change the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of
any outstanding preferred stock if the holders of such affected series of preferred stock are entitled to vote on such an amendment. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters to be voted on by stockholders and also are
entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available therefor. The payment of dividends, if ever, on the common stock will be subject to
(i) the prior payment of dividends on any outstanding shares of preferred stock, and (ii) compliance with any applicable limitation in our debt agreements, including debt securities issued pursuant to this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement. Our common stock has no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock. 
Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors
being elected in each year. A plurality of the votes cast at a stockholders meeting is sufficient to elect any director into office. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK 
Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this section, the words we, us, our
or the company refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  General. Our second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share, or preferred stock. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that shares of
preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, the designations, powers, and preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights
and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions, applicable to the shares of each series of preferred stock. Our board of directors is able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could
adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or the removal of existing management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of the company or remove existing management. As of October 30,
2013, 100,000 shares of our series A preferred stock were issued and outstanding and 32,550 shares of our series B preferred stock were issued and outstanding. Other than the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock, no shares
of preferred stock are currently outstanding.  The specific terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock will be
described in the prospectus supplement relating to that class or series, including a prospectus supplement providing that preferred stock may be issuable upon the exercise of warrants, or upon the conversion of any debt securities, that we issue
pursuant to this prospectus. The description of preferred stock set forth below and the description of the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and
are qualified in their entirety by reference to the articles supplementary relating to that class or series.  The preferences and other
terms of the preferred stock of each class or series will be fixed by the certificate of designation relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement, relating to each class or series, will specify the terms of the preferred stock as
follows:   


 

 
the title and stated value of such preferred stock;   


 

 
the number of shares of such preferred stock offered, the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of such preferred stock; 
 


 

 
the dividend rate(s), period(s), and/or payment date(s) or method(s) of calculation thereof applicable to such preferred stock;


 
a discussion of any material United States federal income tax consequences applicable to an investment in such preferred stock;   


 

 
the relative ranking and preferences of such preferred stock as to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our company;

winding up of the affairs of our company;   


 

 
any voting rights of such preferred stock; and   


 

 
any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of such preferred stock. 
Rank. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to dividend
rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, rank: (i) senior to all classes or series of our common stock, and to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the preferred
stock; (ii) on parity with any class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the preferred stock; and (iii) junior to any other class or series of our stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the
preferred stock.  Conversion Rights. The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any shares of any class or
series of preferred stock are convertible into our common stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto. Such terms will include the number of shares of our common stock into which the shares of preferred stock are
convertible, the conversion price (or manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of
the conversion price and provisions affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock. 
Power to Increase Authorized Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Our Preferred Stock. The number of authorized shares of
preferred stock may be increased by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of the capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required pursuant to the resolutions adopted by the board of directors for such series. Our board of directors has the
power to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of our preferred stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of our preferred stock and thereafter to cause us to issue such classified or reclassified shares of stock. Although our
board of directors does not intend to do so, it could authorize us to issue a class or series that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that
might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interest.  Dividend

supplement.   6.0% Convertible Series A Preferred Stock

the applicable prospectus supplement. Except in limited circumstances, book-entry debt securities will not be issuable in certificated form. 
Certificated Debt Securities. You may transfer or exchange certificated debt securities at any office the applicable issuer
maintains for this purpose in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of certificated debt securities, but payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange may be required.  You may effect the transfer of certificated debt
securities and the right to receive the principal of, or any premium or interest on, certificated debt securities only by surrendering the certificate representing those certificated debt securities and either reissuance by the applicable issuer or
the trustee of the certificate to the new holder or the issuance by the applicable issuer or the trustee of a new certificate to the new holder. 
Global Debt Securities and Book-Entry System. Each global debt security representing book-entry debt securities will be
deposited with, or on behalf of, the Depositary and registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary. 
Covenants  Any
restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of new debt securities will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement.  No
Protection In the Event of a Change of Control  Unless stated otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the new debt
securities will not contain any provisions that may afford holders of the new debt securities protection in the event the applicable issuer has a change in control or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction (whether or not such transaction
results in a change in control) that could adversely affect holders of new debt securities.  Consolidation, Merger and Sale of
Assets  The applicable issuer may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person (a successor person) unless:   


 

 
the applicable issuer is the surviving person or the successor person (if other than the applicable issuer) is a person that is organized and validly existing under the laws of any U.S. domestic jurisdiction and
expressly assumes the applicable issuers obligations on the new debt securities and under the applicable base indenture; and 
  21 


Table of Contents


 

 
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing. 
Notwithstanding the above, any subsidiaries of the applicable issuer may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties to the applicable issuer.  Events of Default 
Event of Default means, with respect to any series of new debt securities, any of the following: 
 


 

 
a default in the payment of any interest upon any new debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is
deposited by the applicable issuer with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period);   


 

 
a default in the payment of principal of any security of that series at its maturity;   


 

 
a default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, if, when and as due by the terms of the new debt securities of that series, and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; 
 


 

 
a default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by the applicable issuer (or, in the case the new debt securities of that series are subject to a guarantee, the guarantor of such guarantee) in
the applicable base indenture (other than a covenant or warranty that has been included in the applicable base indenture solely for the benefit of a series of new debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period
of 60 days after the applicable issuer receives written notice from the trustee or the applicable issuer and the trustee receive written notice from the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that
series as provided in the applicable base indenture;   


 

 
if the new debt securities of such series are subject to a guarantee of a guarantor, such guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by such guarantor or the applicable
issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated or permitted by the applicable base indenture or the terms of the new debt securities of that series; 
 


 

 
certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the applicable issuer; and   


 

 
any other Event of Default provided with respect to new debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of new debt securities (except as to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of new debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the applicable base indenture may constitute an event of
default under certain other indebtedness of the applicable issuer or its subsidiaries outstanding from time to time.  If an Event of
Default with respect to new debt securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series may, by a
notice in writing to the applicable issuer (and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal of (or, if the new debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal
amount as may be specified in the terms of that series), and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all new debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and any premium and accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding new debt securities of the 
  22 


Table of Contents

applicable series will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding new debt securities. At any time
after a declaration of acceleration with respect to new debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the
outstanding new debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default (other than the non-payment of accelerated principal, premium and interest, if any, with respect to new debt securities of that series)
have been cured or waived as provided in the applicable base indenture. You are referred to the prospectus supplement relating to any series of new debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration
of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The applicable base
indenture will provide that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable base indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense which
might be incurred by it in exercising such right of power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method
and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to the new debt securities of that series. 
No holder of any new debt security of any series will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the
applicable base indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the applicable base indenture, unless:   


 

 
that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to new debt securities of that series; and 
 


 

 
the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the
proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has (x) not received from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of that series a direction inconsistent with that request and (y) failed to
institute the proceeding within 60 days.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the applicable base indenture, the holder
of any new debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that new debt security on or after the due dates expressed in that new debt security and to institute
suit for the enforcement of payment.  The applicable base indenture will require the applicable issuer to, within 120 days after the end
of its fiscal year, furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the applicable base indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the securities of any series and is known to a responsible officer
of the trustee, then the trustee must mail to each holder of the securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The applicable base indenture will provide that the trustee may withhold notice to the
holders of new debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any new debt securities of that series) with respect to new debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding
notice is in the interest of the holders of those new debt securities.

Except to the extent the terms of a series of new debt securities otherwise provide with respect to any of such new debt securities or
guarantee thereof, the applicable issuer may also modify and amend the applicable base indenture with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of each series affected by the
modifications or amendments. However, no waiver or amendment may be made without the consent of the holders of each affected new debt security then outstanding if that waiver or amendment will:

securities of such series, waive any past default under the applicable base indenture with respect to that series and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any new debt security of that
series. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding new debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration. 
Defeasance of New Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances 
Legal Defeasance. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable
series of new debt securities, the applicable issuer and the guarantors, if any, will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding new debt securities of any series on the 123rd day after the date of the
deposit referred to below, and the provisions of the applicable base indenture, as it relates to such outstanding new debt securities of such series, will no longer be in effect, except as to certain specified rights, powers, immunities and
provisions. In order to effect such legal defeasance, the following conditions, among others, must be satisfied:   


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the applicable base indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the applicable issuer is a party or by which it is
bound;   


 

 
no default or Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 123rd day after such date; and
  


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that the applicable issuer or guarantor(s), as applicable, have received from, or there has been published by, the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service a ruling or, since the date of execution of the applicable base indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred. 
Defeasance of Certain Covenants. The applicable base indenture will provide that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the
applicable series of new debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:   


 

 
the applicable issuer and, if applicable, may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other covenants set forth in the applicable
base indenture, as well as any additional covenants which may be described in the applicable prospectus supplement; and   


 

 
any omission to comply with those covenants, or with certain other Events of Default, will not constitute a default or an Event of Default with respect to the new debt securities of that series (covenant
defeasance). 
  26 


Table of Contents
The conditions include the following, among others: 
 


 

 
subject to certain rights of the applicable issuer and guarantors, if any, the applicable issuer or, if applicable, any guarantor(s), must deposit, or cause to be irrevocably deposited, with the trustee money or U.S.
government obligations or, in the case of new debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. Dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest
and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank, to pay and discharge each installment of principal of,
premium and interest on and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of all the new debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the applicable base indenture and those new debt
securities; and   


 

 
the applicable issuer or guarantor(s) must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the new debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and related
covenant defeasance had not occurred.  Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default. In the event the
applicable issuer exercises its option to effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of new debt securities, and the new debt securities of that series are declared due and payable immediately following an acceleration after the
occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money or U.S. government obligations or foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of their
stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the new debt securities of that series at the time of such acceleration. However, the applicable issuer shall remain liable for those payments. 
Governing Law  The
applicable base indenture and the new debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the applicable base indenture or the securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof, other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The issuers may sell the securities domestically or abroad to one or more underwriters for public offering and sale by them or may sell the
securities to investors directly or through dealers or agents, or through a combination of methods. Any underwriter, dealer or agent involved in the offer and sale of the securities will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Underwriters may offer and sell the securities at: (i) a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, (ii) market prices prevailing
at the time of sale, (iii) prices related to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale or (iv) negotiated prices. The issuers also may, from time to time, authorize underwriters acting as their agents to offer and sell the
securities upon the terms and conditions as are set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. In connection with the sale of securities, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from the applicable issuer in the form of
underwriting discounts or commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of securities for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell securities to or through dealers, and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of
discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent.  Any
underwriting compensation paid by an issuer to underwriters, dealers or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers, will be set forth in the
applicable prospectus supplement. Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities
may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act. Underwriters, dealers and agents may be entitled, under agreements entered into with any of the issuers, to indemnification against and contribution toward civil
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Any indemnification agreement will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
Unless specified otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, any series of securities issued hereunder will be a new issue with no
established trading market (other than Kennedy-Wilson Holdings common stock, which is listed on the NYSE). If Kennedy-Wilson Holdings sells any shares of its common stock pursuant to a prospectus supplement, such shares will be listed on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The issuers may elect to list any other securities issued hereunder on any exchange, but the issuers are not obligated to do so. Any underwriters or agents to or through whom such securities are sold for
public offering and sale may make a market in such securities, but such underwriters or agents will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the
trading market for any such securities.  If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the issuers may authorize underwriters or
other persons acting as the issuers agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the issuers at the public offering price set forth in the prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed
delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in the prospectus supplement. These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and
educational and charitable institutions. Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any
jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject. The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts. 
To facilitate the offering of the securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities. This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involves the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than the issuers sold to them. In these
circumstances, these persons would cover the over-allotments or 
  29 


Table of Contents

short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option. In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding
for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization
transactions. The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. These transactions may be discontinued at any time. 
The underwriters, dealers and agents and their affiliates may be customers of, engage in transactions with and perform services for the
issuers in the ordinary course of business.  The specific plan of distribution, including any underwriters, dealers, agents or direct
purchasers and their compensation, will be identified in a prospectus supplement.
