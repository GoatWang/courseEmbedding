About Us
Home › Our Company › About Us
Access to Experience
Touchstone Investments helps investors achieve their financial goals by providing access to a distinctive selection of institutional asset managers who are known and respected for proficiency in their specific area of expertise. Learn more.
Recognizing that mastery of all investment disciplines is beyond the scope of any one firm, the use of sub-advisors allows Touchstone to offer an array of strategically focused funds across styles and asset classes. Touchstone's fund lineup includes U.S. equity, international/global equity, U.S. fixed income, diversified income, multi-asset and alternative investment funds.
Touchstone's investment professionals are responsible for the selection, monitoring and replacement of each sub-advisor, subject to the approval of Touchstone Funds' Board of Trustees. Our professionals use a due diligence process commensurate with the standards and guidelines typically used by sophisticated institutional investors and are responsible for the oversight of each sub-advisor including the adherence to each fund's stated investment objective, style integrity, return objective and risk parameters. Touchstone believes that this comprehensive approach to selecting and monitoring of our sub-advisors helps to maximize fund performance over the long-term.
 
Sub-Advisor Selection and Monitoring
Touchstone follows a diligent process when conducting a search for a new sub-advisor. Intensive evaluation leads to a selection of a sub-advisor only if the firm has demonstrated proficiency in its area of declared expertise over a sustained period of time. Specific selection criteria are developed based on the product objective and both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are performed.
We oversee each fund and each manager relative to expectations that were established during the selection process. A formal quantitative analysis is completed quarterly and a qualitative review is performed at least annually in which we reassess the sub-advisor's investment capabilities and supporting infrastructure.
Touchstone Funds have been created to meet defined investment goals and risk-return objectives. Our rigorous sub-advisor selection process and robust oversight approach are designed to ensure that we deliver on our commitment of providing access to institutional asset managers with the goal of achieving favorable long term results.

What is Distinctively Active?
                            
                            At Touchstone Investments, we recognize that not all mutual fund companies are created equal. Our commitment to being Distinctively Active means the employment of a fully integrated and rigorous process for identifying and partnering with asset managers who sub-advise our mutual funds and advocating a robust approach to portfolio construction that either uses active strategies as a standalone or serves as a complement to passive strategies.  That is the power of Distinctively Active.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

We are pleased to provide you with the Touchstone Funds Group Trust Annual      
Report. Inside you will find key financial information, as well as manager      
commentaries for the twelve months ended September 30, 2007.                    

During the previous twelve months investors contended with concerns related to  
the weakening housing market, subprime-mortgage problems that roiled            
financial-services companies worldwide, higher oil prices, the weakening dollar,
and the potential for slower economic growth. However, late in the summer       
investors seemed to be hopeful that the worst of the credit-related problems    
from the housing and subprime-mortgage markets was over and the Federal Reserve 
would be aggressive in its effort to keep the economy from sagging into a       
recession. This view was confirmed as the Fed cut its short-term interest rate  
by one-half percentage point in September, to 4.75%. This was the first rate    
reduction in four years and the steepest in nearly five years. This injected the
liquidity needed and confidence in the financial markets returned.              

During the year, the U.S. equity markets were extremely volatile, however, most 
posted double digit returns for the year. Large cap stocks continued to         
outperform small cap stocks; growth outperformed value for the first time in    
seven years.                                                                    

When we examine where the financial markets may be headed in the year to come,  
we continue to believe that diversification is key to balancing risk and return.
We recommend that you work with your financial professional to employ a sound   
asset allocation strategy that invests in a combination of stock, bond and money
market mutual funds to help keep your financial strategy on course. We also     
suggest maintaining a long-term approach to gain the full potential benefits of 
investing.                                                                      

Touchstone is committed to providing investors access to proven institutional   
money managers who act in a sub-advisory capacity. Our sub-advisors are         
successful investment management firms with demonstrated proficiency in their   
declared area of expertise. We hope that you will find the enclosed commentaries
helpful.                                                                        

We greatly appreciate your continued support. Thank you for including Touchstone
as part of your investment plan.

TOUCHSTONE CLOVER CORE FIXED INCOME FUND                                        
SUB-ADVISED BY CLOVER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.                                  
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Clover Core Fixed Income Fund seeks to produce attractive        
long-term total returns and a high level of current income by investing in a    
diversified portfolio of bonds. The Fund maintains a laddered maturity structure
and a weighted average duration that is consistent with an intermediate bond    
portfolio. However, individual bonds may have a final maturity from one month to
thirty years or more. The Fund managers combine a top down macro economic       
outlook with individual security selection evaluation and techniques. Factors   
such as the business cycle, Federal Reserve policy, and credit spreads are taken
into account to establish an overall framework for sector allocation and yield  
curve positioning, as well as the overall posture of the portfolio.             

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Clover Core Fixed Income Fund was 4.07% for  
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Lehman        
Aggregate Bond Index was 5.14% for the same period.                             

During the first half of this period, the market experienced a further pay off  
to riskier assets which was to the detriment of the Fund's relative performance.
The Fund began to pick up ground on its benchmark during the summer as a flight 
to quality took place in the market, which was a short lived trade as September 
saw risk product recover.                                                       

Strategies employed for the period succeeded in their primary goal of preserving
capital and providing the safe harbor which is expected from a bond portfolio.  
The assessment that investors were not being adequately compensated for the risk
in some of today's securities proved accurate as a significant repricing took   
place, especially in the area of sub-prime mortgages. While these securities are
not a big component of the Fund's benchmark, and therefore did not benefit      
relative performance, the Fund manager's commitment not to chase yield in this  
area protected client assets from the negative price movements seen in other    
investment vehicles. The Fund's defensive posture detracted from returns. We    
expect this posture to shift somewhat as there is now better value in risk      
products than there has been in several years.                                  

The Fund's underweight to corporate bond duration had the most significant      
impact to performance from a sector standpoint. Wider corporate bond spreads led
to weak performance from the sector which benefited the Fund's relative         
performance.                                                                    

Special situation holding, SLM Corp 5.375%, due 5/15/14, detracted from         
performance as it was purchased shortly before market conditions and company    
specific issues caused risk premiums to rise on the company's debt. We believe  
this to be a short term factor and that this bond will be one of the key value  
added holdings of the Fund over time. The Fund's overweight in long duration    
Treasury bonds also hurt performance as yields on 30-year Treasuries were       
slightly higher while the rest of the curve saw yields drop.                    

The Fund had a significant underweight to the mortgage pass through and         
corporate bond sector as measured by contribution to duration. While this       
provides a lower risk profile, we look to add value in key investments which    
continue to be the Fund's holding in SLM Corp. bonds as well as structured      
credit floating rate notes.                                                     

The Fund's recent defensive bias of taking less risk produced lower returns than
the benchmark. However, the lower risk seemed like a prudent decision as risk   
premiums reached record lows as did the transparency in some of today's         
investment offerings. We anticipate significant challenges for active fixed     
income managers as we continue to expect low absolute returns from the bond     
market, especially in comparison to expense ratios. However, the recent market  
disruption is providing some sources of value for the first time in a long time.

TOUCHSTONE DIVERSIFIED GROWTH FUND                                              
SUB-ADVISED BY PITCAIRN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT                                   
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Diversified Growth Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by  
primarily investing in common stocks of companies believed to have above average
earnings or revenue growth potential. A disciplined investment process is       
employed which is focused on risk management and security selection. The risk   
management process is designed to emphasize security selection as the primary   
driver of relative returns and minimize sector and thematic bets. The security  
selection methodology focuses on a company's growth prospects and relative      
evaluation.                                                                     

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Diversified Growth Fund was 16.83% for the   
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell(R) 1000   
Growth Index was 19.35%.                                                        

The Fund's stock selection in the Financial Services sector detracted from      
performance, while its selection in Energy contributed to performance. The Fund 
was impacted by the market's shift from value to growth, with a sizable growth  
premium emerging. This environment has negatively impacted our portfolios, which
have a bias towards value as we seek to own attractively valued securities. Top 
contributors included National Oilwell Varco, Cisco Systems, and Goodrich.      
Detractors from performance included E*TRADE Financial, Children's Place Retail 
Stores, and Amgen.                                                              

The Fund seeks to invest in stocks of companies that provide solid fundamentals 
and trade at attractive prices. We believe that over time, these stocks will    
outperform their peers. Pitcairn does not time the market, nor take sector or   
thematic bets. Therefore, we concentrate on those aspects of portfolio          
management in which we have a high degree of confidence, such as individual     
security selection. We remain true to this process through all market cycles.   

There were no significant changes made to the Fund's strategy during the year.  
The only changes made in regard to positioning were in response to Russell's    
mid-year index reconstitution. These changes included some modest increases and 
decreases to sector and industry exposures.                                     

We believe that, in general, the Fund's characteristics compare favorably versus
the benchmark. We continue to believe that owning securities that are           
undervalued will eventually lead to long-term outperformance. The Fund is       
structured to keep risk exposures relative to the benchmark controlled. Excess  
returns are expected to be generated by individual security selection.

TOUCHSTONE DIVERSIFIED SMALL CAP VALUE FUND                                     
SUB-ADVISED BY CLOVER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT                                        
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Value Fund seeks long-term capital         
appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of U.S.   
companies with smaller market capitalizations. The Fund focuses on companies    
that trade at attractive values relative to cash flow, book value, financial    
strength, and historical valuations. Using a combination of valuation screens,  
technical analysis, and fundamental research, the Fund seeks companies that     
possess attractive long-term return potential due to their lower-than-average   
valuations and improving business fundamentals.                                 

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Value Fund was 9.12%   
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell   
2000(R) Value Index was 6.09% for the same period.                              

Materials & Processing and Producer Durables were the top performing sectors.   
This strength was offset by a negative return in the Consumer Discretionary     
sector, which was impacted by increasing investor concern regarding domestic    
consumer spending in the wake of a challenging real estate market.              

Stock selection in Financial Services and Materials & Processing was solid.     
Performance in Financial Services was achieved by minimizing exposure to credit 
risk. Materials & Processing was aided by a focus on the engineering and        
construction industries. Good performance in these sectors was partially offset 
by weak selection in Health Care, caused by unrelated negative security-specific
events.                                                                         

Among the top performing stocks were Bucyrus International, which was buoyed by 
strength in the mining equipment industry, and Calgon Carbon Corporation, which 
benefited from increasing demand for water filtration and coal emission control,
along with beneficial tariffs on competing Chinese goods. Detractors from       
performance included mall-based retailer Wet Seal, which was hurt by            
consumer-led weakness, and convenience store operator Pantry, whose profits were
squeezed by declining gasoline margins.                                         

Market conditions were variable during the past year, beginning with strong     
optimism and ending with a more cautious tone. In this environment, Fund        
performance was affected positively as our techniques were able to isolate      
stocks with market-beating characteristics.                                     

Looking forward, we expect continued positive influence from Fund holdings in   
the sectors that best exploit the "late cycle" dynamics of the economy. However,
we believe these dynamics will eventually give way to new leadership from       
out-of-favor groups such as Banks and Consumer Finance. We are keeping an eye   
open for indications of stabilization and improvement of the business conditions
in these areas. The Fund remains committed to seeking an optimal portfolio of   
inexpensive stocks with improving fundamentals to take advantage of the proven, 
superior long term returns of small cap value stocks.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Diversified Value Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by   
primarily investing in common stocks of companies believed to be priced below   
their true worth. A disciplined investment process is employed that focuses on  
risk management and security selection. The risk management process is designed 
to emphasize security selection as the primary driver of relative returns and   
minimize sector and thematic bets. The security selection methodology focuses on
stocks with strong fundamental characteristics that are attractively priced     
relative to their peers.                                                        

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Diversified Value Fund was 11.73% for the    
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell 1000(R)   
Value Index was 14.45% for the same period.                                     

Over the last several months, there has been a shift from value to growth, with 
a sizable growth premium emerging. This environment has negatively impacted the 
Fund, which has a bias towards value. Stock selection detracted from            
performance, specifically in the Financial Services sector. Stocks that         
detracted from performance include Pfizer, Capital One Financial, and           
CompuCredit. Contributors to performance were ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and  
Chevron.                                                                        

The Fund seeks to invest in stocks of companies that provide solid fundamentals 
and trade at attractive prices. We believe that over time, these stocks will

There were no significant changes made to the Fund's strategy during the year.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Family Heritage(R) Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by  
primarily investing in common stocks of U.S. companies in which the founding    
family still maintains significant influence over the direction of the firm. The
Fund's security selection methodology emphasizes a company's growth prospects   
and relative valuations, which seeks to identify stocks that offer significant  
growth potential, but are attractively priced relative to their peers.          

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Family Heritage(R) Fund was 12.91% for the   
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Dow Jones Wilshire
5000SM Index was 16.99% and for the Russell 3000(R) Index was 16.52% for the    
same period.                                                                    

Over the last several months, there has been a shift from value to growth, with 
a sizable growth premium emerging. This environment negatively impacted the     
Fund, which has a bias towards value. The Fund's security selection, especially 
in the Financial Services sector, detracted from performance. Consumer Staples  
was the largest contributing sector to performance. Individual companies that   
detracted from performance include CompuCredit, Capital One Financial, and      
Flagstar Bancorp. The stronger performers among the Fund's holdings were        
Stryker, Central European Distribution, and Telephone & Data Systems.           

The Fund seeks to invest in stocks of companies that provide solid fundamentals 
and trade at attractive prices. We believe that over time, these stocks will    
outperform their peers. We do not time the market, nor take sector or thematic  
bets. Therefore, we concentrate on those aspects of portfolio management in     
which we have a high degree of confidence, such as individual security          
selection. We remain true to this process through all market cycles.            

With the exception of modest increases and decreases to sector and industry     
exposure, there were no significant changes made to the Fund's strategy during  
the year. The Fund is structured to keep risk exposure controlled. Excess       
returns are expected to be generated by individual security selection. We       
believe the Fund's characteristics, in general, compare favorably versus the    
benchmark. In addition, we continue to believe that owning securities that are  
undervalued versus their potential will eventually lead to long-term            
outperformance.                                                                 

We remain confident that our core approach to portfolio management, along with  
our unique focus on companies with significant ownership by the founding family 
or related foundation will deliver favorable long-term investment results.

TOUCHSTONE HEALTHCARE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY FUND                                    
SUB-ADVISED BY TURNER INVESTMENT PARTNER, INC.                                  
PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                                          

The Touchstone Healthcare and Biotechnology Fund invests primarily in common    
stocks of healthcare and biotechnology companies. Turner employs rigorous       
fundamental research with supporting qualitative and technical analysis. Its    
bottom-up strategy emphasizes fundamental analysis. The Fund seeks companies    
with improving fundamentals, superior earnings prospects, reasonable valuations,
and favorable trading-volume and prices patterns.                               

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Healthcare and Biotechnology Fund was 19.25% 
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the S&P 500   
Healthcare Index was 8.70% for the same period.                                 

The main factors contributing to the Fund's performance were stock selection and
positioning. Shire Pharmaceutical's acquisition of New River Pharmaceuticals had
a positive effect on performance. Shire has reported strong earnings results,   
and the company also received final FDA and DEA approval for Vyvanse, their next
generation attention deficit disorder drug. Intuitive Surgical Inc. continues to
deliver strong returns. The company is experiencing strong sales of its robotic 
surgical tool, the Da Vinci System. The purchases are being fueled by rapid     
adoption of the device in gynecology and urology surgeries. Our decision to     
eliminate Pfizer was a significant contributor to relative returns. The sale,   
based on concerns of the commercial profile of Torcetrapib, was a favorable one 
as the benchmark, a 12% weight, suffered when the stock was under pressure.     

On a relative basis when compared to the benchmark, the Fund suffered from its  
position in Merck, which was much smaller than the benchmark's 7% weight. Merck 
reported solid earnings that beat estimates and also boosted its earnings       
outlook for the full year. Sepracor, a maker of pharmaceutical products,        
declined as Medicare reimbursement for their asthma drug, Xopenox, was cut      
dramatically. Medco, a provider of pharmacy benefit management, also contributed
to the benchmarks return and hurt relative performance.                         

We remain underweight vs. the benchmark in large pharmaceuticals but are        
narrowing the gap, as we are finding individual opportunities within this group.
Generally, we expect many large pharmaceutical companies to experience upside   
earnings surprises due to favorable foreign currency trends and solid           
prescription trends.                                                            

Market observers attribute large-cap stocks' strength in recent months to strong
international contributions to the companies' profits (large firms do more      
business overseas than their smaller counterparts) and relatively attractive    
valuations. As a result of our bottom up research, about 50% of the Fund is     
invested in companies over $15 billion in market capitalization. In addition, as
a growing proportion of revenues are being derived outside the U.S. borders,    
currently 12% of the Fund is invested in companies outside the United States.   

We employ a disciplined investment strategy when selecting stocks by identifying
strong healthcare companies with favorable earnings prospects and reasonable    
valuations. We also look for unique characteristics within each industry to     
ensure the Fund is invested in only the best companies. For example, when       
researching the pharmaceuticals industry, we look at pricing trends,            
intellectual property profiles and conduct pipeline analysis. When looking at   
biotechnology companies, we focus on clinical trial design, corporate regulatory
expertise, clinician feedback, and reimbursement analysis. We utilize these     
tools so the Fund is positioned to achieve consistent investment returns while  
maintaining disciplined risk controls.

Management's Discussion of Fund Performance (Continued)                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not make top-down decisions but rather we find opportunities through our  
investment discipline of fundamental bottom-up research on a company-by-company 
basis. However, as a result of our individual company research, purchases have  
increased the Fund's biotech exposure to now compose over 14% of the Fund,      
compared to 10% weight for the benchmark.                                       

We continue to anticipate that 2007 will prove to be a year in which            
price/earnings ratios expand, a circumstance that typically bodes well for      
healthcare stocks. We think the stock market should be higher at the end of the 
year than it is now, and we continue to find companies with compelling          
fundamentals. In addition, balance sheets in the Health Care sector remain flush
with cash, boosting the possibility of stock buybacks and mergers and           
acquisitions in the sector.

TOUCHSTONE INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND                                            
SUB-ADVISED BY AXA ROSENBERG INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT LLC                          
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone International Equity Fund (the "Fund") seeks long-term capital   
appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of non-U.S. companies  
located in a broad array of countries. The Fund's investment approach is        
designed to identify attractively priced companies that are believed to have    
superior future earnings potential. Focus is placed on evaluating the financial 
characteristics of individual stocks and a company's fundamental data rather    
than forecasting the trends in markets, investment styles or selectors. Its     
stock selection process is driven by proprietary technology designed to analyze 
the fundamentals of more than 19,000 securities and to evaluate the relative    
attractiveness of stocks in its universe.                                       

AXA Rosenberg's stock selection process includes two fundamental insights on    
each company in our universe. The Valuation Model identifies bargains, and      
expensive stocks within each industry; and the Earnings Forecast Model          
identifies companies with superior/inferior year-ahead earnings.                

The fundamental valuation of stocks by the Valuation Model is the heart of our  
investment process. The model first classifies companies into one or more of 170
business segments, valuing each company's individual operating businesses, based
on assets, earnings and sales by business segment, in comparison with similar   
business operations of other companies. The model then refines the business     
segment valuations to account for the financial data only reported at the       
company-wide level, including footnote information (over 200 line items in all).
The result is a single valuation for each of the more than 5,500 US broad market
companies we follow. The difference between AXA Rosenberg's valuation and the   
market price reflects an opportunity for profit.                                

A second opportunity for profit is captured by our Earnings Forecast Model,     
which combines numerous fundamental variables related to earnings change with   
variables that capture investor enthusiasm for companies. These variables       
include measures of profitability, measures of operational efficiency,          
individual analysts' earnings forecasts, broker recommendations, earnings       
surprise and prior market performance. Together, these data are used to predict 
earnings changes over the following 12 months. Each company's earnings forecast 
alpha is added to its valuation alpha to arrive at a total company alpha.       

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Fund was 26.01% for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2007. The total return of the S&P Citigroup World Ex-US Index was 26.54% and the
total return of the MSCI All Country World ex-US Index was 31.06% for the same  
period.                                                                         

From a regional perspective, Asia ex Japan was the strongest performer in both  
absolute terms and relative to its regional benchmark. Europe also contributed  
to the portfolio's out-performance while contribution from Japan was negative.  
Across all regions, industry and sector selection were positive while the Fund's
style relative to the benchmark and stock picking within industries were weak.  

The Materials sector produced the best performance for the portfolio. Across all
regions, but particularly in Asia, overweight to the Basic Minerals & Metals    
industry was highly rewarded. With holdings that included Anglo American and    
Thyssen Krupp in Europe and Rio Tinto and Posco in Asia, the portfolio strongly 
outperformed the benchmark in this sector. The portfolio also benefited from its
positioning in the Consumer Discretionary sector. With an overweight in the Cars
and Trucks industry and in individual securities including auto maker           
DaimlerChrysler and tire maker Michelin, the portfolio added value both from the
sector overweight and from stock selection. In fact, the overweight in          
DaimlerChrysler, which gained more than 100% over the past year, resulted in the
portfolio's top stock contribution. Our Valuation Model has had a favorable view
of this stock for sometime now while our Earnings Model has shown an            
increasingly attractive rating since early 2007.

Management's Discussion of Fund Performance (Continued)                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most challenging sector over the past year was Financials. With Financials  
underperforming the broader market, the sector underweight was a modestly good  
call. However, weak stock selection in Misc. Finance (Brokers & Asset           
Management), and an underweight in the outperforming REITs industry negated the 
small gains from the sector positioning. Among the weaker selections included an
underweight in ABN-Amro, which rose most of the year on merger rumors, and an   
overweight in UBS AG, which fell mostly during the third quarter on sub-prime   
lending losses. Also contributing weakly to performance was the Industrials     
sector where both the industry underweighting and stock selection in            
Construction/Homebuilding and Transportation detracted from performance.        

Net of industries, the Fund's modest value bias characterized by its lower      
Price/Book ratio was the major detractor from performance, as investors have    
increasingly shown a preference for growth stocks year to date. Its modestly    
higher exposure to Earnings Variation or to companies that produced earnings    
surprises (like DaimlerChrysler), offset some of the weakness from the Fund's   
relative value positioning.

TOUCHSTONE MID CAP FUND                                                         
SUB-ADVISED BY TURNER INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.                                 
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Mid Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by primarily   
investing in stocks of medium capitalization companies. It emphasizes companies 
operating in a broad range of industries based on a fundamental analysis of each
company with consideration to such characteristics as price-to-cash flow,       
price-to-earnings and price-to-book value ratios. The Fund looks for companies  
with quality management teams, strong fundamentals, well-positioned balanced    
sheets and distinctive product opportunities that may be positioned to generate 
and sustain long-term growth.                                                   

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Mid Cap Fund was 18.13% for the fiscal year  
ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell Midcap(R) Index was   
17.87% for the same period.                                                     

Strong stock selection in the Financial Services, Energy and Producer Durables  
sectors were the largest contributors to relative performance, while Consumer   
Discretionary and Health Care stocks detracted from relative results.           

At the sector level, Financial Services has struggled throughout much of 2007,  
but strong stock selection has made it the strongest performing sector on a     
relative basis. Leading the way was IntercontinentalExchange Inc. Shares of the 
commodities and futures exchange increased as it continues to be a leader in    
terms of product and technological innovation. While unsuccessful, their bidding
war earlier in the year to acquire the Chicago Board of Trade clearly displays  
their commitment to grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions.   
A.G. Edwards was another top contributor among Financial Services as the stock  
surged on news it was being acquired by Wachovia Bank in a deal that would      
create the nation's second-largest retail brokerage.                            

FMC Technologies, the second-largest contributor to the Fund on a relative      
basis, has consistently grown revenue about twice as fast as the overall subsea 
market by expanding the scope of its subsea offerings and will benefit from the 
new five-year agreement they signed with Statoil to provide equipment for       
international developments.                                                     

Other stocks contributing to performance included Precision Castparts Inc. and  
ON Semiconductor Inc. Precision Castparts is a metal components manufacturer    
that continued to benefit from improved operating margins. The company reported 
robust demand, a sustained aerospace cycle, and better than expected            
profitability contribution from recent acquisitions. ON Semiconductor Inc. was  
helped by increasing sales to the computer industry and an increase in consumer 
electronics demand.                                                             

The largest detractor from performance over the last twelve months was Amdocs   
Ltd. Shares of the software maker traded lower after management cut its 2007    
revenue forecast. Demand for their products and services remains strong, but not
at the same pace that was originally expected. Also detracting from performance 
was DaVita Inc. The stock was volatile throughout the year and finished slightly
lower due to integration concerns after acquiring NxStage.                      

Other stocks that detracted from relative performance were AerCap Holdings and  
Security Capital Assurance Ltd. AerCap, an integrated aviation company that     
engages in the trading and leasing of aircraft, failed to meet earnings         
expectations due to charges related to refinancing some of their bonds. Security
Capital was also down as the insurance provider was negatively impacted by      
slower refunding activity.

Management's Discussion of Fund Performance (Continued)                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We employ a two-pronged approach to select stocks and construct portfolios. For 
growth stocks, we perform fundamental analysis to determine if the positive     
business momentum identified by our earnings model will persist. In addition,   
the company's balance sheet and cash flows are analyzed to verify that the      
company has the financial strength required to grow at the rate implied by the  
model. For value stocks, we employ a series of screens designed to identify     
hidden assets that will signify attractive return potential and downside        
protection to share prices. For instance, we seek to identify characteristics   
like a large net cash position, undervalued assets such as land, overfunded     
pension assets, non-strategic businesses that can be sold, and undervalued      
brands or market shares. Then we look for a catalyst for positive change in the 
companies' fundamentals or strategies -- a prerequisite if an out-of-favor stock
is to rise in price; otherwise, without that catalyst, an out-of-favor stock can
simply fall even more out of favor. During the last year, we have identified    
more opportunities using our earnings model which has resulted in the Fund      
having a slight growth tilt. The Fund was positioned this way to take advantage 
of owning companies that were experiencing strong earnings momentum while       
selling at reasonable valuations.                                               

In managing the Fund, our focus, as always, remains on owning stocks that we    
think have either undervalued assets or strong prospective earnings power. We   
currently favor shares of companies in the wireless, homeland security, civil   
infrastructure, raw materials, semiconductor, industrial parts, premium         
retailing, software, managed care, financial data, securities exchange, and     
investment management groups. The Fund holds overweight positions in the        
Producer Durables, Technology, Health Care, and Materials & Processing sectors. 

We think the stock market can draw strength from the continued health of the    
global economy, which should help to bolster corporate earnings in the U.S. and 
around the world. Corporate America's second-quarter profits rose about 8%, a   
rate that was below the double-digit norm of the past three years but           
nevertheless was still above the long-term average of 7.6%. We also think profit
growth may again hit the low double digits in the fourth quarter. As long as    
earnings stay reasonably healthy, we think the stock market is in little danger 
of morphing from a bull to a bear in the near term. In our analysis, the        
much-chronicled housing slump and subprime-loan malaise won't in all likelihood 
be severe enough to tip the economy into a recession and the stock market into  
bearish territory.

TOUCHSTONE PITCAIRN TAXABLE BOND FUND                                           
SUB-ADVISED BY PITCAIRN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT                                   
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Pitcairn Taxable Bond Fund seeks to deliver maximum total return 
consistent with moderate risk of capital and maintenance of liquidity. The Fund 
invests in a broad range of investment grade fixed income securities across the 
full maturity spectrum. Additional value may be gained by anticipating changing 
credit conditions and identifying unique anomalies offered by the market.       

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Pitcairn Taxable Bond Fund was 4.81% for the 
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Lehman U.S.       
Government Credit Index was 5.08% for the same period.                          

Most of the market activity occurred during the third quarter of 2007. Sub-prime
mortgage fears captured the attention of fixed income investors. Liquidity in   
all sectors, with the exception of U.S. Treasuries, dried up for a period of    
days, as investors were caught in a quagmire of headlines. This                 
flight-to-quality was best exhibited in the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill whose    
yield dropped significantly in August. Investors believed that quality could    
only be found in very short U.S. Treasuries. The Federal Reserve took action by 
lowering the discount rate, and subsequently the Federal Funds Rate, as Chairman
Bernanke faced his first real challenge. When the dust finally settled and the  
major mortgage originators were still in business, investors slowly re-entered  
markets of riskier assets.                                                      

The yield curve steepened during the fiscal year. The major action occurred on  
the short end (5-years and shorter) as the Federal rate reductions had its      
desired effect of improving liquidity in financial markets. The short duration  
of corporate exposure benefitted the Fund, as corporate bonds underperformed    
both U.S. Treasuries and agencies.                                              

The Fund continues to be characterized as high quality with a weighted average  
rating of AA, and is conservatively structured with corporate-spread risk       
concentrated at the short end of the duration spectrum.

above-average potential for revenue or earnings growth. The Fund invests in 25  
to 30 companies that are generally high-quality seasoned and growing businesses,
spread across an array of attractive and growing industries. Sands Capital      
generally seeks stocks with sustainable above average earnings growth, and with 
capital appreciation potential. In addition, Sands Capital looks for companies  
that have a significant competitive advantage, a leadership position or         
proprietary niche, a clear mission in an understandable business, financial     
strength and that are valued rationally in relation to comparable companies, the
market, and the business prospects for that particular company.                 

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Sands Capital Select Growth Fund was 19.95%  
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell   
1000(R) Growth Index was 19.35% for the same period.                            

The Fund's security selection contributed to performance for the year. The      
securities which had the greatest positive impact on absolute performance as    
well as on relative performance were Google, Apple, IntercontinentalExchange,   
Schlumberger and Intuitive Surgical. Detractors from absolute performance       
include Starbucks, Apollo, Moody's, Varian Medical and Red Hat. The detractors  
from relative performance include Starbucks, Genentech, Moody's Corp, Apollo and
Genzyme.                                                                        

Sands Capital generally considers selling a security when it no longer meets the
investment criteria or when the issues causing such problems are not solvable   
within an acceptable time frame. During the year, the Fund sold four stocks -   
Red Hat, Apollo Group, eBay and Patterson.                                      

Seven stocks were purchased during the fiscal year - Broadcom, Salesforce,      
Expeditor's International, FMC Technologies, Cerner, National Oilwell Varco, and
EMC - all of which met Sands Capital's investment criteria.                     

Broadcom is a leading designer of semiconductor chips for a number of end       
markets in networking, wireless, video processing, and consumer electronics. It 
is an intellectual property company that designs and sells semiconductor chips  
in the networking, wireless, and consumer electronics end-markets.              

Salesforce is the leading provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), focusing    
primarily on the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) segment of the          
seventy-nine billion dollar enterprise software market. Compared to traditional 
licensed software, SaaS offers several compelling benefits to customers         
including lower total cost of ownership over time, much lower upfront costs, and
lower implementation risk. The company has a tremendous business model based on 
recurring subscription revenues with a scalable, fixed-cost base. Further,      
Salesforce is rapidly building a platform and an ecosystem of third-party       
developers that will allow it to address other segments of enterprise software  
besides CRM.                                                                    

Expeditor's International is a third party logistics provider (3PL) focused on  
international freight forwarding and customs brokerage. Expeditors is           
essentially a "travel agent" for freight, making the necessary arrangements to  
facilitate the movement of customers' international air or ocean cargo from     
origin to destination. Within the rapidly growing 3PL space, Expeditors has     
established itself as a standout leader, driving share gains with superior      
service, technology, and global reach.

Management's Discussion of Fund Performance (Continued)                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FMC Technologies is the leading global provider of highly-engineered subsea     
equipment used in the production and processing of oil and natural gas from     
offshore wells. This market is rapidly expanding as exploration and production  
efforts are becoming increasingly focused on offshore fields because of: 1)     
their compelling size and economics, 2) the maturation of the world's onshore   
basins, and 3) limited onshore access for international oil companies.          

Cerner is the leading global provider of healthcare information technology      
solutions. The company's flagship product, the Cerner Millennium software suite,
has a broad and deep set of clinical applications designed to improve safety,   
quality, and efficiency in the hospital setting. Cerner's organically-built     
Millennium architecture, broad product portfolio, and global franchise makes it 
uniquely positioned to benefit from the robust secular tailwinds driving        
adoption of clinical information systems. Pay-for-performance initiatives from  
both private and public payers are pushing hospital adoption of clinical        
information systems and electronic medical records past an inflection point.    

National Oilwell Varco is an energy equipment and services company. It is the   
leading provider of critical drilling rig equipment such as top drives, pipe    
handling systems, and control instruments, as well as related consumables and   
services. There are few competitors for many of its products, which are often   
the de-facto industry-standard brand names.                                     

EMC is the leading provider of enterprise storage solutions, a segment which    
Sands Capital expects to grow faster than overall IT spending due to the        
continued implementation of compliance and business continuity requirements and 
the rapid adoption of Internet video.                                           

Sands Capital Management has always strictly adhered to a bottom-up,            
company-focused investment process rather than a top-down, thematic approach.   
Yet Sands process also requires a keen awareness of important secular trends and
an ability to anticipate changes to these trends. These trends often lay the    
groundwork for attractive industry dynamics. They also act as a growth tailwind 
for individual companies within those industries. Consequently, Sands ongoing   
quest to invest in the world's greatest growth companies also enables Fund      
shareholders to benefit from some of the world's most compelling long-term      
trends. Examples include: 1) the trend toward minimally invasive surgery, which 
is represented by our ownership in Intuitive Surgical, the leader in robotic    
surgery for radical prostatectomies and a growing number of other procedures; 2)
the shift in futures and options trading mechanisms from open outcry pits to    
electronic exchanges, which is represented by our ownership in both CME Group   
and IntercontinentalExchange; and 3) the proliferation of handheld devices      
worldwide, which is represented by the Fund's ownership in QUALCOMM, Broadcom,  
America Movil, and Apple. QUALCOMM and Broadcom are the technology leaders in   
cell phone chipsets, America Movil is Latin America's leading wireless network  
operator, and Apple recently entered the one billion unit-per-year cell phone   
market with its revolutionary new iPhone. These are just a few of the many      
favorable trends that influence Fund companies and increase the likelihood that 
they will continue to achieve above-average earnings growth over the            
long-term--the key to common stock price appreciation and wealth creation.

TOUCHSTONE SHORT DURATION FIXED INCOME FUND                                     
SUB-ADVISED BY CHARTWELL INVESTMENT PARTNERS                                    
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Short Duration Fixed Income Fund seeks to provide above market   
income, liquidity and risk-adjusted total return. Fund management targets these 
goals using a low risk approach, selecting a core group of securities from      
better yielding sectors within the government and corporate markets, and        
enhancing liquidity and yield by combining very short maturities with fixed rate
issues in a barbell structure. The Fund avoids higher risk strategies, including
exposure to non-dollar currencies and below "A" rated credits. The Fund         
generally has an average duration between 1.5 and 2.0 years and holds no more   
than 20% of the portfolio in non-government issues.                             

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Short Duration Fund was 5.19% for the fiscal 
year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Lehman 1-3 Year U.S.     
Government Bond Index was 5.72% for the same period.                            

The Fund benefited from a dramatic rally in short-term rates as investors sought
the safety of U.S. Treasury securities during the credit crisis of 2007. The    
Fund's performance lagged the benchmark as U.S. Treasuries dramatically         
outperformed all other sectors of the market. The yield curve steepened         
dramatically during this yield rally as short rates declined over the year and  
ten-year bond yields did not rally significantly. The Fund's strategy to        
diversify away from floating rate notes and into more fixed rate debt early in  
the year helped performance. Floating rate notes have lagged fixed rate notes in
the recent rally and will continue to outperform in a stable or falling interest
rate environment. Our continuing focus on the high quality source of excess     
yield provided by government mortgage-backed securities helped Fund performance 
as 98% of the Fund is invested in agency backed bonds.                          

Looking forward, the Fund's emphasis on high quality, short duration securities 
should provide for both attractive relative income and better than average price
performance. The monthly principal cash flows provided by core agency           
mortgage-backed securities holdings enhance Fund liquidity and allow us to      
continually seek out securities that maximize investor returns consistent with  
the Fund's investment philosophy.

TOUCHSTONE SMALL CAP FUND                                                       
SUB-ADVISED BY PITCAIRN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT                                   
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by primarily 
investing in common stocks of U.S. small capitalization companies. The Fund is  
diversified by issuer and industry and typically owns both value and growth     
stocks. A disciplined investment process is employed which is focused on risk   
management and security selection. The risk management process is designed to   
emphasize security selection as the primary driver of relative returns and      
minimize sector and thematic bets. The security selection methodology emphasizes
a company's growth prospects and relative valuations which seek to identify     
stocks that offer significant growth potential, but are attractively valued     
relative to their peers.                                                        

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Small Cap Fund was 8.44% for the fiscal year 
ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell 2000(R) Index was     
12.34% for the same period.                                                     

Over the last several months there has been a shift from value to growth, with a
sizable growth premium emerging. This environment has negatively impacted the   
Fund, which has a bias towards value. The Fund's stock selection in the         
Financial Services and Producer Durables sectors detracted from performance,    
while its selection in the Consumer Discretionary sector contributed to         
performance. Top contributors included Golden Telecom, WMS Industries, and      
Tenneco. Detractors from performance included Asyst Technologies, Southwest     
Bancorp and Central Pacific Financial.                                          

The Fund seeks to invest in stocks of companies that provide solid fundamentals 
and trade at attractive prices. We do not time the market, nor take sector or   
thematic bets. Therefore, we concentrate on those aspects of portfolio          
management in which we have a high degree of confidence, such as individual     
security selection. We remain true to this process through all market cycles.   

There were no significant changes made to the Fund's strategy during the year.  
The only changes made in regard to positioning were in response to Russell's    
mid-year index reconstitution. These changes included some modest increases and 
decreases to sector and industry exposures.                                     

Going forward, we remain focused on searching for niche companies with          
compelling valuation levels and solid long-term growth prospects as compared to 
their peers.

TOUCHSTONE SMALL CAP VALUE OPPORTUNITIES FUND                                   
SUB-ADVISED BY    TURNER INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.                              
DIAMOND HILL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.       
JAMES INVESTMENT RESEARCH, INC.             
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund seeks long-term capital       
appreciation by primarily investing in common stocks of companies with small    
market capitalizations that are believed to have the potential for growth and   
that appear to be trading below their perceived value. It invests in securities 
of companies operating in a broad range of industries.                          

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund was 10.77%
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell   
2000(R) Value Index was 6.09% for the same period.                              

TURNER INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.                                                

Strong stock selection in the Financial Services and Producer Durables sectors  
were the largest contributors to relative performance, while Energy and Consumer
Staples detracted from relative results of our portion of the Fund. Although    
Financial Services struggled throughout much of 2007, strong stock selection    
made it the strongest performing sector on a relative basis. Our portion of the 
Fund remains underweight in the Financial Services sector overall, and more     
specifically, REITS and banks, which helped excess return. Two online software  
companies that provide web-based technology services companies contributed to   
excess return, Online Resources and S1 Corp. Online Resources completed its     
acquisition of a leading bill pay service provider which was viewed as favorable
by investors. S1 Corp. reported solid earnings which also gave investors        
confidence in new management for the company. In addition, its acquisition of   
HUB International helped performance.                                           

Energy struggled due to the performance of Allis-Chalmers Energy, which provides
high-end drilling services. It reported a pullback in activity and pricing.     
Subpar returns in Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary were driven by    
losses in Cott Corp. and Pantry. The beverage distributor, Cott Corp., reported 
lower demand for carbonated soft drinks and rising commodity prices. Pantry, the
convenience store chain, also was a detractor after reporting relatively low    
gasoline margins. All three detractors mentioned were sold from the portfolio.  

Turner's investment strategy focuses on identifying undervalued securities by   
virtue of their being overlooked by industry analysts. Most industry analysts   
concentrate on income statements. While we use this metric in our analysis, we  
also pay close attention to the balance sheet and cash flows. Through this      
process, we seek to find companies with unrecognized intrinsic values that are  
not evident in earnings reports. We remain disciplined in this process and will 
typically be positioned with companies that display these characteristics. In   
managing the portfolio, our focus, as always, remains on owning stocks that we  
think have either undervalued assets or strong prospective earnings power.      

We currently favor shares of companies in the wireless, homeland security, civil
infrastructure, raw materials, semiconductor, industrial parts, premium         
retailing, software, managed care, financial data, securities exchange, and     
investment management groups. The portfolio holds overweight positions in the   
Technology, Producer Durables, Health Care, and Autos & Transportation sectors.

Management's Discussion of Fund Performance (Continued)                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We think the stock market can draw strength from the continued health of the    
global economy, which should help to bolster corporate earnings in the U.S. and 
around the world. Corporate America's second-quarter profits rose about 8%, a   
rate that was below the double-digit norm of the past three years but           
nevertheless was still above the long-term average of 7.6%. And we think profit 
growth may again hit the low double digits in the fourth quarter. As long as    
earnings stay reasonably healthy, we think the stock market is in little danger 
of morphing from a bull to a bear in the near term. In our analysis, the        
much-chronicled housing slump and subprime-loan malaise won't in all likelihood 
be severe enough to tip the economy into a recession and the stock market into  
bearish territory.                                                              

DIAMOND HILL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.                                           

An overweight allocation as well as stock selection in the Energy sector        
contributed to relative performance in our portion of the Fund. The portfolio is
overweight the Energy, Autos & Transportation and Consumer Discretionary sectors
relative to the benchmark as we believe the valuation of the individual holdings
in these sectors are attractive.                                                

Top performers during the year were Energy holdings Helmerich & Payne, Encore   
Acquisition and Berry Petroleum primarily due to higher oil prices. Additional  
positive contributors were Apria Healthcare Group and Century Aluminum. The     
largest detractors were Finish Line based on skepticism related to its potential
acquisition of footwear company Genesco, MoneyGram due to concerns regarding its
exposure to mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio, and Gevity HR Inc.     

Higher defaults in the mortgage market led to tightened credit conditions, and  
declines in real estate values held back Financial Services and spilled over    
into the consumer discretionary sector. During the year, the Consumer           
Discretionary sector was one of the sectors that detracted from the absolute    
performance of the portfolio. Producer Durables and Health Care contributed to  
returns.                                                                        

Diamond Hill uses an intrinsic value approach, which is price sensitive. Outside
of Energy, we have had more difficulty finding small cap equities at dramatic   
discounts to our estimates of intrinsic value. During the year, we were able to 
take the opportunity to initiate positions at what we believe are favorable     
prices in Toro, Flowers Foods and Hanesbrands. We also eliminated positions from
the Fund including Apria Healthcare, MAF Bancorp and Tidewater after these      
companies reached our estimated intrinsic value. Regarding Energy, our          
investment thesis remains the same given our long-term expectations that a      
long-term tightness in the supply-demand balance that is not fully reflected in 
the stock prices.                                                               

We believe the portfolio is positioned relatively defensively given the high    
cash balance and what we believe are holdings at discounts to their intrinsic   
value. Certain segments of the portfolio, Energy for example, will likely depend
on adequate global economic growth (though not necessarily stellar domestic     
growth) in order for the stocks within that sector to be solid performers. The  
portfolio is underweight in the areas of Technology and Health Care, which could
lead to relative underperformance if those sectors are leaders.                 

Our 5-year outlook for the equity market is for expected returns in the mid     
single digits, which would be below long-term and recent averages. This forecast
has only a minor effect on what we do as bottom-up investors. Our goal for the  
Fund is to provide added value by outperforming the relevant benchmark over the 
long term, measured as 5 years or more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third quarter was a difficult environment for small cap value securities.   
The James approach, which seeks companies with good profitability and relative  
strength in addition to good relative value, shows the dynamic benefit of not   
relying on just one factor in making investment decisions.                      

Consumer Discretionary, Materials & Processing and Producer Durables contributed
to the relative performance of our portion of the Fund. Consumer Staples,       
Financial Services and Technology detracted slightly from performance.          
Individual stocks that had the biggest impact include Schnitzer Steel, Matrix   
Service Co., Hurco Cos., and Spartan Stores.                                    

Our philosophy relies on a disciplined insistence on buying true small cap value
stocks that are profitable and are exhibiting strong relative price strength,   
but still trading at value price levels relative to earnings, cash flow and book
value. We know from our experience that high relative strength stocks are harder
hit at the beginnings of corrections, but that our approach works very well in  
down and sideways markets.                                                      

We remain fully invested, with our sector weightings set defensively as the U.S.
economy continues to fight the housing market malaise. As we look to the future,
our macro-indicators suggest increased opportunities are ahead for select       
Utilities and Producer Durables securities. We will, of course, remain          
diversified among all the major sectors and continue to seek the best bargain   
stocks for the portfolio.                                                       

2007 has presented a challenging landscape for small cap stocks, and our        
economic outlook suggests this may continue for a time. However, 2008 is a      
Presidential election year and investors may see better things for smaller      
securities. Going back to 1926, Ibbotson data indicates that smaller stocks have
typically advanced over 22 percent in election years. Our initial research shows
that most investors will find the upcoming investment environment to be         
challenging but there should be opportunities ahead as well.

TOUCHSTONE STRATEGIC VALUE AND HIGH INCOME FUND                                 
ADVISED BY TOUCHSTONE ADVISORS, INC.                                            
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Strategic Value and High Income Fund (the "Fund") seeks total    
return through a combination of long-term capital growth and high current       
income. The Fund is a "fund of funds" which means that it invests substantially 
all of its assets in shares of other mutual funds, rather than in individual    
securities. Generally, the Fund invests its assets in shares of other Touchstone
Funds - the Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Value Fund and the Touchstone High 
Yield Fund. The Fund periodically adjusts its asset allocation among these Funds
in response to changing market and economic conditions, the performance of the  
underlying funds, or for other reasons. In addition, the Fund may, under certain
circumstances, invest in other underlying funds within the Touchstone Funds     
family.                                                                         

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Fund was 6.46% for the fiscal year ended September 30,
2007. The total return of the 60/40 blend of the Russell 2000(R) Value Index and
Merrill Lynch High Yield Index was 6.72% and the total return of the S&P 500    
Index was 16.44% for the same period.                                           

As of September 30, 2007, the Fund had an allocation of 60% to the Touchstone   
Diversified Small Cap Value Fund and 40% to the Touchstone High Yield Fund.     

Market conditions in the equity market were variable during the past year,      
beginning with strong optimism and ending with a more cautious tone. In this    
environment, Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Value Fund performance was        
affected positively as investment techniques were able to isolate stocks with   
market-beating characteristics. Stock selection in Financial Services and       
Materials & Processing was solid. Performance in Financial Services was achieved
by minimizing exposure to credit risk. Materials and Processing was aided by a  
focus on the engineering and construction industries. Good performance in these 
sectors was partially offset by weak selection in Health Care, caused by        
unrelated negative security-specific events. The Fund remains committed to      
seeking an optimal portfolio of inexpensive stocks with improving fundamentals  
to take advantage of the proven, superior long term returns of small cap value  
stocks.                                                                         

For the twelve month period, the high yield market saw a little bit of          
everything. The net result was a high yield market total return that            
approximated the yield with little contribution from capital appreciation or    
depreciation. The Touchstone High Yield Fund underperformed its benchmark due to
its higher-quality bias as well as its allocation to certain industries. During 
the last twelve months, performance of the Touchstone High Yield Fund was aided 
by overweight allocations to the Metals, Capital Goods and Healthcare sectors as
well as underweight allocations to the Automotive/Auto Parts and Paper          
industries. Conversely, overweight allocation to Homebuilders and Building      
Materials detracted from performance. We believe the Fund's strategy of         
fundamental credit analysis with particular emphasis on avoiding problem credits
will continue to add value as negative credit events may have a material impact 
on returns in this lower return environment. The Fund is designed to exhibit    
less volatility than the broad market and deliver attractive risk adjusted      
returns for performance over a full cycle, with focus on protecting principal in
down markets.

TOUCHSTONE TAX-EXEMPT BOND FUND                                                 
SUB-ADVISED BY PITCAIRN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT                                   
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Tax-Exempt Bond Fund is managed with a focus on providing income 
exempt from federal income taxes; ensuring total returns consistent with        
moderate risk of capital; and maintaining adequate liquidity. The Fund invests  
in a broad range of investment grade municipal fixed-income securities across   
the full maturity spectrum. Additional value may be gained by anticipating      
changing credit conditions and identifying unique anomalies offered by the      
market.                                                                         

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Tax-Exempt Bond Fund was 2.71% for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Lehman Municipal Bond    
Index was 3.10% for the same period.                                            

During the fiscal year, yields rose and the yield curve steepened. Rates rose on
the AAA scale by approximately 25 basis points in the 30-year area of the curve 
and only 2 basis points in the 2-year area of the curve. This steepening and    
excess return in higher quality sectors illustrates investors' low threshold for
risk during the sub-prime meltdown. Pre-refunded bonds were the best performing 
sector followed by general obligations and revenue bonds. Zero coupon bonds     
underperformed all other coupon structures during the fiscal year. The long     
duration of zero coupon bonds contributed to this underperformance. New issues  
remained strong, as low rates continued to entice issuers to bring deals to     
market.                                                                         

The Fund's underexposure to longer duration securities contributed to           
performance. The Fund's portfolio is characterized by a solid average credit    
rating of AAA/AA and bears a premium yield in comparison to the benchmark.

TOUCHSTONE ULTRA SHORT DURATION FIXED INCOME FUND                               
SUB-ADVISED BY CHARTWELL INVESTMENT PARTNERS                                    
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Ultra Short Duration Fixed Income Fund seeks to provide above    
market income, liquidity, and risk-adjusted total return. Fund management       
targets these goals using a low risk approach, selecting a core group of        
securities from better yielding sectors within the government and corporate     
markets, and enhancing liquidity and yield by combining very short maturities   
with fixed rate issues in a barbell structure. The Fund avoids higher risk      
strategies, including exposure to non-dollar currencies and lower quality       
credits. The Fund generally has a targeted duration of 0.5 years and has 100% of
its portfolio in government issues.                                             

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Ultra Short Duration Fixed Income Fund was   
5.48% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the     
Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index was 5.22% for the same period.   

The Fund's performance was driven by the fact that short-term interest rates    
rallied over the year as the sub-prime credit swoon that began in June continued
into the third quarter and did not subside until the Federal Reserve stepped in 
and lowered the Federal Funds rate in mid-September. U.S. Treasury securities   
trounced all other sectors of the market as investors fled to the safety of     
Treasury-backed securities. The short agency- backed securities rallied right   
along with the short end of the market allowing the Fund to outperform its      
benchmark for the year.                                                         

The Fund's strategy to diversify away from floating rate notes and into more    
fixed rate debt early in the year helped performance. Floating rate notes have  
lagged fixed rate notes in the recent rally and will continue to outperform in a
stable or falling interest rate environment. Our continuing focus on the high   
quality source of excess yield provided by government mortgage-backed securities
helped Fund performance as 97% of the Fund is invested in agency-backed bonds.  

Looking forward, the Fund's emphasis on high quality, short duration securities 
should provide for both attractive relative income and better than average price
performance. The monthly principal cash flows provided by core agency           
mortgage-backed securities holdings enhance Fund liquidity and allow us to      
continually seek out securities that maximize investor returns consistent with  
the Fund's investment philosophy.

TOUCHSTONE VALUE OPPORTUNITIES FUND                                             
SUB-ADVISED BY CLOVER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.                                  
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND PROCESS                                               

The Touchstone Value Opportunities Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by 
investing in common stocks of U.S. companies with large, medium and small market
capitalizations. The Fund focuses on companies that trade at attractive values  
relative to cash flow, book value, financial strength, and historical           
valuations. Using a combination of valuation screens, technical analysis, and   
fundamental research, the Fund seeks companies that possess attractive long-term
return potential due to their lower-than-average valuations and improving       
business fundamentals.                                                          

FUND PERFORMANCE AND POSITIONING                                                

The total return of the Touchstone Value Opportunities Fund was 15.83% for the  
fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. The total return of the Russell 3000(R)   
Value Index was 13.73% for the same period.                                     

From a sector perspective, the Fund finished the year underweight in Financial  
Services. Notably, it had no direct exposure to the sub-prime market debacle and
maintained minimal exposure to REITs. As these two "hot" industries within the  
sector began their steep correction, the reverberating effects and change in    
investor sentiment were felt throughout the sector.                             

The Materials & Processing sector benefited from strong stock selection. Shaw   
Group posted strong returns as the company put its accounting problems to rest  
and investors have increasingly come to see Shaw Group as a unique player on the
need to build out power generation infrastructure around the globe.             

Partially offsetting performance was the Technology sector where RF Micro       
Devices and Fairchild Semiconductor, in particular, turned in disappointing     
showings. The Health Care sector also struggled, primarily due to the           
performance of Pfizer.                                                          

The concerns surrounding sub-prime and the uncertain consequences it might pose 
for the economy shook the markets at different times during the past six months.
With the dollar weakening and mixed signals coming from economic data, anxiety  
became heightened. Leading investors began to allocate capital to companies with
international exposure and more predictable business profiles. This dynamic     
played well to an overweight in Consumer Staples and also benefited key holdings
such as General Electric, McDonalds, and Exxon Mobil.                           

The Fund continues to focus on identifying inexpensive stocks with improving    
fundamentals and improving investor sentiment. We continue to express a         
preference for such stocks that also possess international exposure and stable  
earnings profiles.                                                              

The Fund continues to maintain a somewhat defensive stance given its overweight 
in Consumer Staples, Healthcare, and Utilities and underweight in Financial     
Services. We are pursuing research work in certain industries within the        
Consumer Discretionary and Financial Services sectors where valuation levels    
have begun to reflect despair on the part of investors and, perhaps, have also  
begun to obscure more positive business attributes that could be worthwhile for 
future investment.

                       PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

*     The chart above represents performance for Class Z shares only, which will
   vary from the performance of Class A shares and Class C shares based on
   the differences in loads and fees paid by shareholders in the different
classes. The initial public offering of Class Z shares commenced on 
  December 6, 1991 and the initial public offering of Class A shares and
  Class C shares commenced on November 20, 2006. The Class A and Class C
     performance information is calculated using the historical performance of
Class Z.                                                            

**    The average annual total returns shown above are adjusted for maximum     
applicable sales charges.                                           

The performance of the above Fund does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares.

   fees paid indirectly. If these expense offsets were included, the ratio
would have been 1.18%.

The Strategic Value and High Income Fund is a "Fund of Funds" and offers        
shareholders the opportunity to invest in certain underlying affiliated         
investment companies.                                                           

Each Fund is registered as a diversified portfolio of the Trust with the        
exception of the Family Heritage(R) Fund, Healthcare and Biotechnology Fund,    
Pitcairn Taxable Bond Fund, and Sands Capital Select Growth Fund, each of which 
is non-diversified.                                                             

The Funds are registered to offer different classes of shares: Class A shares,  
Class C shares, Class Y shares, Class Z shares, Class I shares, and Class II    
shares. The assets of each Fund are segregated, and a shareholder's interest is 
limited to the Fund in which shares are held. The Funds' prospectus provides a  
description of each Fund's investment objectives, policies, and strategies along
with information on the classes of shares currently being offered.              

Based on approval by the Board of Trustees, the following changes took place    
effective November 20, 2006:

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

The following is a summary of the Funds' significant accounting policies:       

SECURITY VALUATION -- The Funds' portfolio securities are valued as of the close
of the regular session of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (currently 4:00
p.m., Eastern time). Portfolio securities traded on stock exchanges are valued  
at the last sale price and portfolio securities quoted by NASDAQ are valued at  
the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (NOCP). Securities not traded on a particular 
day, or for which the last sale price is not readily available, are valued at   
their last broker-quoted bid prices as obtained from one or more of the major   
market makers for such securities by an independent pricing service. Debt       
securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at their
most recent bid prices as obtained from one or more of the major market makers  
for such securities by an independent pricing service. Money market instruments 
and other debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than 60 days are    
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market. Securities for which market
quotations or the NOCP are not readily available are valued based on fair value 
as determined by or under the direction of the Board of Trustees. Shares of     
open-end mutual funds in which the Funds invest are valued at their respective  
net asset values as reported by the underlying funds. The prices for foreign    
securities are reported in local currency and converted to U.S. dollars using   
currency exchange rates.                                                        

For securities that principally trade on a foreign market or exchange, a        
significant gap in time can exist between the time of a particular security's   
last trade and the time at which a Fund calculates its net asset value. The     
closing prices of such securities may no longer reflect their market value at   
the time the Fund calculates its net asset value if an event that could         
materially affect the value of those securities (a "Significant Event") has     
occurred between the time of the security's last close and the time that the    
Fund calculates its net asset value. A Significant Event may relate to a single 
issuer or to an entire market sector. If the advisor or sub-advisor of a Fund   
becomes aware of a Significant Event that has occurred with respect to a        
security or group of securities after the closing of the exchange or market on  
which the security or securities principally trade, but before the time at which
the Fund calculates its net asset value, it may request that a Fair Value       
Committee Meeting be called. In addition, the Funds' administrator or           
sub-administrator monitors price movements among certain selected indices,      
securities and/or baskets of securities that may be an indicator that the       
closing prices received earlier from foreign exchanges or markets may not       
reflect market value at the time the Fund calculates its net asset value. If    
price movements in a monitored index or security exceed levels established by   
the Advisor, the Sub-Administrator notifies the Advisor or Sub-Advisor for any  
Fund holding the relevant securities that such limits have been exceeded. In    
such event, the Advisor makes the determination whether a Fair Value Committee  
meeting should be called based on the information provided.                     

The International Equity Fund also uses a third-party fair valuation vendor. The
vendor provides a fair value for foreign securities held by the Fund based on   
certain factors and methodologies (involving, generally, tracking valuation     
correlations between the U.S. market and each non-U.S. security). Values from   
the fair value vendor are applied in the event that there is a movement in the  
U.S. market that exceeds a specific threshold that has been established by the  
Fair Value Committee. The Fair Value Committee has also established a           
"confidence interval" which is used to determine the level of historical        
correlation between the value of a specific foreign security and movements in   
the U.S. market before a particular security will be fair valued when the       
threshold is exceeded. In the event that the threshold established by the Fair  
Value Committee is exceeded on a specific day, the Fund will value the non- U.S.
securities in its portfolio that exceed the applicable "confidence interval"    
based upon the adjusted prices provided by the fair valuation vendor.

Notes to Financial Statements (Continued)                                       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The assets of the Strategic Value and High Income Fund consist of investments in
underlying affiliated investment companies, which are valued at their respective
net asset value per share.                                                      

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued       
Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value         
Measurements." This standard establishes a single authoritative definition of   
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires          
additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to   
fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing standards.    
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years      
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The changes to current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) from the 
application of this Statement relate to the definition of fair value, the       
methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair     
value measurements. As of September 30, 2007, the Trust does not believe the    
adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial      
statements, however, additional disclosures may be required about the inputs    
used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of the measurements  
reported on the statement of changes in net assets for a fiscal period.         

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -- The books and records of the International      
Equity Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars and translated into U.S. dollars on  
the following basis:                                                            

(1)   market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the      
current rate of exchange on the valuation date; and                 

(2)   purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at the  
 relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions.                                                       

The International Equity Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses 
on investments in equity securities that is due to changes in the foreign       
exchange rates from that which is due to changes in market prices of equity     
securities.                                                                     

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS - The International Equity Fund may enter    
into forward foreign currency contracts as hedges against specific transactions.
All commitments are "marked-to-market" daily at the applicable foreign exchange 
rate, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded currently. The  
International Equity Fund realizes gains or losses at the time forward contracts
are extinguished. Unrealized gains or losses on outstanding positions in forward
foreign currency contracts held at the close of the year are recognized as      
ordinary income or loss for income tax purposes. As of September 30, 2007, the  
International Equity Fund had the following forward foreign currency exchange   
contracts outstanding as follows:

PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED -- Each Fund may lend its portfolio securities.     
Lending portfolio securities exposes a Fund to the risk that the borrower may   
fail to return the loaned securities or may not be able to provide additional   
collateral or that the Fund may experience delays in recovery of the loaned     
securities or loss of rights in the collateral if the borrower fails            
financially. To minimize these risks, the borrower must agree to maintain       
collateral marked to market daily, in the form of cash and/or liquid securities,
with the Fund's Custodian in an amount at least equal to the market value of the
loaned securities. As of September 30, 2007, the following Funds loaned         
securities and received collateral as follows:

All collateral received as cash and securities is received, held and            
administered by the Funds' custodian for the benefit of the Funds in the        
applicable custody account or other account established for the purpose of      
holding collateral.                                                             

Funds participating in securities lending receive compensation in the form of   
fees, or retain a portion of interest or dividends on the investment of any cash
received as collateral. The Funds also continue to receive interest or dividends
on the securities loaned. The loans are secured by collateral valued at least   
equal, at all times, to the fair value of the securities loaned plus accrued    
interest. Unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the securities loaned    
that may occur during the term of the loan is recognized by the Funds. The Funds
have the right under the lending agreement to recover the securities from the   
borrower on demand.                                                             

DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS -- The Funds may purchase or sell securities on a 
when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions involve a commitment  
by the Funds to purchase or sell securities for a predetermined price or yield, 
with payment and delivery taking place beyond the customary settlement period.  
When delayed delivery purchases are outstanding, the Funds will set aside liquid
assets in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price. When purchasing a    
security on a delayed delivery basis, the Funds assume the rights and risks of  
ownership of the security, including the risk of price and yield fluctuations,  
and take such fluctuations into account when determining net asset value. The   
Funds may dispose of or renegotiate a delayed delivery transaction after it is  
entered into, and may sell when-issued securities before they are delivered,    
which may result in a capital gain or loss. When the Funds have sold a security 
on a delayed delivery basis, the Funds do not participate in future gains and   
losses with respect to the security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- Repurchase agreements, which are collateralized by U.S.
Government obligations, are valued at cost, which together with accrued interest
approximates market. At the time each Fund enters into a repurchase agreement,  
the seller agrees that the value of the underlying collateral securities,       
including accrued interest, will at all times be equal to or exceed the face    
amount of the repurchase agreement.                                             

SHARE VALUATION -- The net asset value per share of each class of shares of each
Fund is calculated daily by dividing the total value of a Fund's assets         
attributable to that class, less liabilities attributable to that class, by the 
number of outstanding shares of that class.                                     

The maximum offering price per share of Class A shares of the Funds is equal to 
the net asset value per share plus a sales load equal to 6.10% of the net asset 
value (or 5.75% of the offering price). The maximum offering price per share of 
Class C, Class Y, Class Z, Class I, and Class II shares of the Funds is equal to
the net asset value per share.                                                  

The redemption price per share of each class of shares of the Funds is equal to 
the net asset value per share. However, Class C shares of the Funds are subject 
to a contingent deferred sales load of 1.00% of the original purchase price if  
redeemed within a one-year period from the date of purchase.                    

INVESTMENT INCOME -- Interest income is accrued as earned and includes, where   
applicable, the pro-rata amortization of premium or accretion of discount.      
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.                            

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS -- The Healthcare and Biotechnology Fund,         
International Equity Fund, Mid Cap Fund, and Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund 
declare and distribute net investment income, if any, annually, as a dividend to
shareholders. The Diversified Growth Fund, Diversified Small Cap Value Fund,    
Diversified Value Fund, Family Heritage(R) Fund, Sands Capital Select Growth    
Fund, Small Cap Fund, Strategic Value and High Income Fund, and Value           
Opportunities Fund declare and distribute net investment income, if any,        
quarterly, as a dividend to shareholders. The Clover Core Fixed Income Fund,    
Pitcairn Taxable Bond Fund, Short Duration Fixed Income Fund, Tax-Exempt Bond   
Fund, and Ultra Short Duration Fixed Income Fund declare net investment income  
daily and distribute it monthly, as a dividend to shareholders. Any net realized
capital gains on sales of securities for all Funds are distributed to           
shareholders at least annually.                                                 

ALLOCATIONS -- Investment income earned, realized capital gains and losses, and 
unrealized appreciation and depreciation for the Funds are allocated daily to   
each class of shares based upon its proportionate share of total net assets of  
the Fund. Class specific expenses are charged directly to the class incurring   
the expense. Common expenses, which are not attributable to a specific class,   
are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon its proportionate share  
of total net assets of the Fund. Expenses not directly billed to a Fund are     
allocated proportionally among all Funds daily in relation to net assets of each
Fund or another reasonable measure. In addition to the Fund's direct expense,   
shareholders of the Strategic Value and High Income Fund also bear a            
proportionate share of the underlying funds' expenses.                          

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS -- Security transactions are accounted for on the trade   
date. Securities sold are determined on a specific identification basis.        

ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.    
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the      
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.

next $4 billion of aggregate average daily net assets; and 0.12% of the

However, through February 28, 2008, the administration fees are limited to an

Prior to January 1, 2007, the Advisor received an annual fee of 0.15% of the    
aggregate average daily net assets of the Trust up to $2 billion and 0.12% of

Under the terms of the Transfer Agent Agreement, effective November 20, 2006,   
between the Trust and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan and formerly          
Integrated Investment Services, Inc.), JPMorgan maintains the records of each

accounts, processes purchases and redemptions of each Fund's shares, acts as    
dividend and distribution disbursing agent and performs other shareholder       
service functions. For these services, JP Morgan receives a monthly fee per     
shareholder account from each Fund. In addition, each Fund pays JPMorgan        
out-of-pocket expenses including, but not limited to, postage and supplies.     

Prior to November 20, 2006, DST Systems, Inc. served as the transfer agent and  
dividend disbursing agent for the Funds under a transfer agency agreement with  
the Trust.

6. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION                                                      

It is each Fund's policy to continue to comply with the special provisions of   
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. As      
provided therein, in any fiscal year in which a Fund so qualifies and           
distributes at least 90% of its taxable net income, the Fund (but not the       
shareholders) will be relieved of federal income tax on the income distributed. 
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. In order to avoid     
imposition of the excise tax applicable to regulated investment companies, it is
also each Fund's intention to declare and pay as dividends in each calendar year
at least 98% of its net investment income (earned during the calendar year) and 
98% of its net realized capital gains (earned during the twelve months ending   
October 31) plus undistributed amounts from prior years.

Certain reclassifications, the result of permanent differences between financial
statement and income tax reporting requirements have been made to the components
of capital. These reclassifications have no impact on the net assets or net     
asset value per share of the Funds and are designed to present the Funds'       
capital accounts on a tax basis. The following reclassifications of net         
investment loss have been made to the following Funds for the year ended

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB 
Interpretatin No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN 
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,      
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires  
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of  
preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are     
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax  
positions not deemed to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded 
as a tax expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax    
years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance allows implementing FIN 48  
in fund NAV calculations as late as the Fund's last NAV calculation in the first
required financial statement reporting period. As a result, the Funds will      
incorporate FIN 48 in their semi annual report on March 31, 2008. Management is 
in the process of determing the impact of adoption.

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES                                                

The Funds indemnify the Trust's Officers and Trustees for certain liabilities   
that might arise from their performance of their duties to the Funds.           
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts  
that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which provide      
general indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements  
is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the    
Funds that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Funds expect
the risk of loss to be remote.                                                  

8. CONCENTRATIONS/RISKS                                                         

Certain Funds invest a high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of   
the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a    
result, the Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility on the Fund's net asset value and magnified     
effect on the total return.                                                     

The International Equity Fund invests in securities of foreign issuers in       
various countries. These investments may involve certain considerations and     
risks not typically associated with investments in the United States of America,
as a result of, among other factors, the possibility of future political and    
economic developments and the level of governmental supervision and regulation  
of securities markets in the respective countries.                              

9. SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS/ACQUISITION                                  

On July 13, 2007, a Special Meeting of Shareholders was held to approve or      
disapprove an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization providing for the transfer of
all of assets and liabilities of the Pitcairn Select Value Fund to the          
Diversified Value Fund in exchange for shares of the Diversified Value Fund and 
the subsequent liquidation of the Pitcairn Select Value Fund.                   

The acquisition was approved as follows:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Touchstone Funds Group Trust       

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Touchstone Funds Group Trust, comprised of    
Touchstone Clover Core Fixed Income Fund, Touchstone Diversified Small Cap Value
Fund, Touchstone Short Duration Fixed Income Fund, Touchstone Ultra Short       
Duration Fixed Income Fund, Touchstone Small Cap Value Opportunities Fund,      
Touchstone Healthcare & Biotechnology Fund, Touchstone Strategic Value and High 
Income Fund, Touchstone Value Opportunities Fund (collectively, the "Former     
Turner Funds"), Touchstone Mid Cap Fund ("Former Westlake Fund"), Touchstone    
Diversified Value Fund, Touchstone Diversified Growth Fund, Touchstone Small Cap
Fund, Touchstone Family Heritage Fund, Touchstone Pitcairn Taxable Bond Fund,   
Touchstone Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, Touchstone Sands Capital Select Growth Fund,   
and Touchstone International Equity Fund (collectively, the "Former Pitcairn    
Funds"), (the seventeen funds collectively referred to as the "Funds", and      
formerly known as the "Constellation Funds" which were comprised of the former  
funds listed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements) as of September 30, 2007,   
and the related statements of operations for the year then ended and the        
statements of changes in net assets and financial highlights for each of the two
years in the period then ended. We have also audited the financial highlights of
the Former Turner Funds for each of the two years or periods in the period ended
September 30, 2003 and the Former Westlake Fund for the period ended December
31, 2003. These financial statements and financial highlights are the           
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an    
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our     
audits. The financial highlights for each of the two years in the period ended  
September 30, 2005 of the Former Turner Funds and Former Westlake Fund were     
audited by other auditors whose report dated November 29, 2005, expressed an    
unqualified opinion on those financial highlights. The financial highlights for 
each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2003 of the Former        
Pitcairn Funds were audited by other auditors whose report dated December 12,
2003, expressed an unqualified an unqualified opinion on those financial        
highlights.                                                                     

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the         
financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to  
perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Our   
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a 
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the    
Funds' internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no    
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence       
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing   
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of September 30, 2007, by correspondence    
with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a    
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each  
of the respective Funds comprising Touchstone Funds Group Trust at September 30,
2007, the results of their operations for the year then ended and the changes in
their net assets and financial highlights for each of the two years in the      
period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the financial highlights referred to
above are presented fairly, in all material respects, for the Former Turner     
Funds for each of the two years or periods in the period ended September 30,
2003, and for the Former Westlake Fund for the period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

and procedures that the Sub-Advisor uses in fulfilling this responsibility and  
information regarding how those proxies were voted during the twelve month

free 1.800.543.0407. These items are also available on the Securities and       
Exchange Commission's (the Commission) website at http://www.sec.gov.           

QUARTERLY PORTFOLIO DISCLOSURE                                                  

The Trust files a complete listing of portfolio holdings for each Fund as of the
end of the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The        
complete listing (i) is available on the Commission's website; (ii) may be      
reviewed and copied at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC;
and (iii) will be made available to shareholders upon request by calling        
1.800.543.0407. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be
obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.                                             

SCHEDULE OF SHAREHOLDER EXPENSES                                                

As a shareholder of the Funds, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction    
costs, including reinvested dividends or other distributions; and (2) ongoing   
costs, including investment advisory fees; distribution (12b-1) fees; and other 
Fund expenses. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing     
costs (in dollars) of investing in the Funds and to compare these costs with the
ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.                               

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account     
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together  
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the   
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600      
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number  
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During the Six      
Months Ended September 30, 2007" to estimate the expenses you paid on your      
account during this period.                                                     

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical      
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Funds' actual expense     
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Funds' actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not  
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for  
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of        
investing in the Funds and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical  
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

services (statutory audits and services associated with SEC registration        
statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other    
documents issued in connection with securities offerings), audit-related        
services (accounting consultations related to accounting, financial reporting or
disclosure matters not classified as "audit services," assistance with          
understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting guidance  
from rulemaking authorities, agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures related to
accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply with         
financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters and assistance with       
internal control reporting requirements under Form N-SAR and Form N-CSR), tax   
services that have historically been provided by the auditor that the Committee 
believes would not impair the independence of the auditor and are consistent    
with the SEC's rules on auditor independence and permissible non-audit services 
classified as "all other services" that are routine and recurring services.     

(e)(2) All services described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of Item 4 were      
approved by the Audit Committee.
