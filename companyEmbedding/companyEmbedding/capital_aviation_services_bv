the “CHC Group”);

AND WHEREAS CHC and the Executive
wish to provide for the following compensation to be paid to the

CHC;

THEREFORE CHC and the Executive in
consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein agree as
follows:

EMPLOYMENT

delegated to him from time to time by the Board of Managers of CHC
Helicopter SaRL (the “Board”) and shall have overall
responsibility for the management of the CHC Group,

1.2 The Executive agrees to devote
his full working time and effort and attention to the business,
operations and affairs of the CHC Group, but shall be permitted to
continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Caring
for Cambodia, a charitable organization. In addition, for so long
as the Executive and CHC agree that his involvement on the boards
listed on Schedule A hereto is not detracting from his attention
to, focus and ability to fulfill, his duties hereunder, the
Executive may serve as a member of such boards. The Executive will
not join other boards or accept other external professional
commitments without prior approval of the Board.

1.3 The Executive agrees that the
employment created hereby may be with such affiliate of CHC as CHC

executives of CHC provided that CHC shall guaranty the performance
of such affiliate of its obligations to the Executive.

1.4 The Executive agrees that he
shall establish a principal residence in the Metro Vancouver area
by no later than July 31, 2011. The Executive may, at his
option, elect to establish his new residence in the State of
Washington proximate to Metro Vancouver. CHC and the Executive
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
necessary Canadian visas and work permits required for
the


Executive to perform his duties hereunder and
CHC shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable expenses,
including legal fees and administrative charges, incurred by the
Executive in connection with obtaining such visas and/or work
permits.

1.5 Upon Executive’s
commencement of employment, at the option of the Executive, CHC and
First Reserve Corporation (“First Reserve”) will take
all necessary steps to elect the Executive to the Board and the
boards of directors or managers (or similar position) of other
companies within the CHC Group where First Reserve has nominee
directors, subject only to tax planning considerations. Executive
agrees to resign from such boards upon termination of employment

serves as is provided to other CHC Group directors or
managers.

price per share paid by affiliates of First Reserve upon its
acquisition of the CHC Group.



 



 


(b)


Concurrently with such
investment, CHC shall advance to the Executive the sum of
US$500,000 to be used solely to assist with the acquisition of

governed by the terms and conditions of the Management Shareholders
Agreement of Caymanco, to which the Executive shall become a party
concurrently with the investment, a copy of which has been provided
to the Executive. The Executive’s holdings of Ordinary B
Shares purchased pursuant to paragraph 3.5(a) shall be deemed to be
Management Shares, as that term is defined in the Management
Shareholder Agreement.



 



 


(c)


Notwithstanding
the terms of the Management Shareholders Agreement, in the event
the Executive’s employment is terminated without Cause, for
Good Reason, or as a result of death or Permanent Disability in the
first two (2) years of this Agreement, CHC agrees to cause
Caymanco (or such other entity within the CHC Group as CHC shall
then elect) to repurchase the Purchased Shares for the greater of
(i) Fair Value determined as specified in the Management
Shareholders Agreement and upon the terms thereof and
(ii) US$2,000,000 within thirty (30) days of such
termination or resignation. Following such date, the terms of the
Management Shareholders Agreement shall govern. The Executive
agrees that any amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph 3.5(c)
shall be net of amounts paid or payable on his behalf to CHC
pursuant to paragraph 3.5(b).



 



 


(d)


The operation
of paragraph 3.5(c) hereof shall be suspended for such time and to

Executive shall not in aggregate be less favourable to the
Executive than the benefits described in Schedule B
hereto.

3.9 Pension Plan . The
Executive will be eligible to participate in CHC’s designated
defined contribution pension plan in accordance with the terms of
that plan.

For each
calendar year during which the Executive is subject to Canadian or
other non-U.S. tax as a result of income arising under this
Agreement, CHC will extend to the Executive the benefit of tax
equalization calculated based on taxes which would have been
applicable if the Executive had maintained his residence in Austin,
Texas.

(b)


Notwithstanding
paragraph (a) above, in no circumstances shall tax
equalization be paid by CHC (i) in respect of income arising
from the Executive’s participation in CHC’s Management
Equity Program as amended (or similar equity-linked compensation
programs as may be implemented from time to time), or (ii) to
indemnify or reimburse the Executive for any federal or provincial
tax paid or payable as a result of his departure from Canada or
termination of Canadian resident status.



 



 


(c)


The concept of
tax equalization is that in a given calendar year the Executive
will pay no more and no less worldwide tax than applicable U.S.
federal, state and local income tax and social security tax on his
hypothetical income from CHC. The Executive’s hypothetical
income from CHC for a calendar year for the purposes of tax
equalization will be all income received pursuant to this Agreement
during such calendar year (the “Hypothetical Income”)
excluding income arising from the Executive’s participation
in CHC’s Management Equity Program, amended (or similar
equity-linked compensation programs as may be implemented from time
to time. CHC will not equalize any income the Executive receives
from sources other than CHC (“Personal
Income”).



 



 


(d)


The benefits of
any foreign earned income exclusions and credits relating to
CHC-paid foreign tax claimed on US tax returns and arising from
income received from CHC will belong to CHC and are held for
CHC’s benefit by the Executive. CHC may, at its discretion
and for a period of ten years following termination of the
Executive’s employment, require the Executive to provide
copies of his U.S. tax return to the tax professional referred to
in paragraph 3.10 for the purpose of determining whether any
foreign tax credits may be recaptured and should be paid to CHC.
The provision of any such returns shall be on the basis that the
information contained therein is to be held confidential by the tax
professional and not shared with CHC except for the purpose
described in this paragraph 3.11(d).



 



 


(e)


The
Executive’s Hypothetical Tax will be calculated as the sum of
applicable U.S. federal, social security (FICA+Medicare), state and
local tax, based on the Executive’s primary U.S. domiciliary
residence in Austin, Texas on the Executive’s Hypothetical
Income. In determining the Executive’s Hypothetical Tax, the
Executive will be provided the benefit of any deductions and
exemptions that can be claimed under applicable U.S., state and
local law provided that the amounts giving rise to such deductions
and exemptions were paid by the Executive and reasonable proof
thereof is submitted to CHC. In addition, the Executive will be
granted the benefit of a hypothetical itemized deduction for the
amount of hypothetical state and local tax charged to him. The
Hypothetical Tax will be calculated by applying to the Hypothetical
Income the effective tax rate determined taking into consideration
any Personal Income and the benefits described above. This approach
is intended to fairly allocate the benefit of the graduated tax
structure and applicable deductions between the Executive and
CHC.



 



 


(f)


During the
year, CHC will withhold an estimated Hypothetical Tax from the
Executive’s compensation instead of the federal income tax
withholdings which would have been applicable to his Hypothetical
Income (“Estimated Hypothetical Tax Amount”). CHC will
be liable for and pay on the Executive’s behalf all actual
taxes due in the U.S. and Canada with respect to his Hypothetical
Income.

(g)


The
Executive’s tax equalization calculation will be prepared by
the tax professionals selected as specified in paragraph 3.10 above
after completion of the Executive’s U.S. and foreign income
tax returns. This calculation is intended to reconcile any
difference between the Executive’s final Hypothetical Tax and
the Estimated Hypothetical Tax that was withheld from the
Executive’s compensation during the year. If the Estimated
Hypothetical Tax exceeds the final Hypothetical Tax, the Executive
shall be entitled to a reimbursement from CHC. If the final
Hypothetical Tax exceeds the Estimated Hypothetical Tax, CHC shall
be entitled to a reimbursement from the Executive.



 



4.


EXPENSES




CHC shall promptly reimburse the
Executive for:

4.1 All reasonable expenses paid or
incurred by the Executive in connection with the performance of the
Executive’s duties and responsibilities hereunder, upon
presentation of expense vouchers or other appropriate
documentation.

4.2 All reasonable professional
expenses, such as licenses and dues and professional educational
expenses, paid or incurred by the Executive during the
Term.

4.3 The costs of a personal

Executive’s residence, including the monthly fees related to
such devices.

4.4 CHC shall reimburse the
Executive the reasonable costs of relocating his family and
household to Metro Vancouver or a proximate location in the State
of Washington. Alternatively, the Executive may elect to have CHC
retain the services of a relocation company at its expense to
manage said relocation. In addition, CHC shall pay to the Executive
a one time, payment of US$250,000, net of all taxes (including
without limitation U.S. and Canadian income taxes) resulting from
such payment, to cover any additional costs associated with
relocation.

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.

purpose of this paragraph the following terms shall have the
following meaning:

(a) “ Cause ”
shall mean:

(i) the Executive’s continued
failure (other than due to the Executive’s mental or physical
incapacity) to substantially perform all of the duties and
responsibilities of Executive’s position;

(ii) the Executive’s failure
to comply with any of the material provisions of this
Agreement;

(iii) an act of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Executive in the performance
of the duties and responsibilities of the Executive’s
position;

(iv) the commission by the Executive
of any act constituting fraud, breach of fiduciary duty,
dishonesty, or misappropriation and that causes material damage to
the property or business of Heli-One or CHC; or

(v) the Executive’s admission
or conviction of any offence that, in the judgment of the Board,
adversely affects the reputation of Heli-One and/or CHC or the
Executive’s ability to carry out the Executive’s
responsibilities under this Agreement.

(b) “ Good Reason
” shall mean:

(i) the Executive is assigned duties
inconsistent with the Executive’s position or duties
hereunder and which result in a material reduction in the nature or
scope of the powers, authority, functions, or duties of the
Executive; or

(ii) a material decrease in the
Executive’s compensation under this Agreement (other than a
decrease generally applicable to other similarly situated
Executives) or a failure by Heli-One to pay any material amounts
due to the Executive hereunder or otherwise comply with any of the
material provisions of this Agreement.

(c) “ Notice of
Termination ” shall mean a written notice which
(i) indicates the specific termination provision in this

termination of the Executive’s employment under the provision
so indicated and (iii) specifies the proposed termination
date.

(d) “ Total Disability

Executive is substantially unable to perform those duties that the
Executive would otherwise be expected to perform and the
non-performance of such duties has continued for any one hundred
and twenty (120) consecutive days or one hundred and eighty
(180) non-consecutive days in any twelve (12) consecutive
months.
 
4



5.2 Accrued Benefits . Upon
termination of the Executive’s employment for any reason, the
Executive (or the Executive’s estate, if applicable) shall be
entitled to receive within thirty (30) days after the
termination date: (a) earned but unpaid Base Salary through
the termination date; (b) payment for any earned but unused
vacation days; and (c) reimbursement for all business expenses
properly incurred prior to the termination date, submitted in
accordance with Heli-One policy no later than ten (10) days
after the termination date, and not yet reimbursed. Except as
otherwise provided in this paragraph 5.2, Employee shall have no
further rights to any compensation or benefits under this
Agreement. All other accrued and vested benefits, if any, due the
Executive following the Executive’s termination of employment
shall be determined and paid in accordance with the plans,
policies, and practices of Heli-One.

5.3 Termination for Cause .
The Executive’s employment under this Agreement may be
terminated by Heli-One for Cause by giving the Executive Notice of
Termination. If the sole basis for termination is subparagraph
(a)(i) of paragraph 5.1, the Executive shall have ten
(10) business days after such Notice of Termination is
received (or such longer period as may be prescribed by the Notice
of Termination) to cure the deficiency or deficiencies identified.
If the Executive’s employment is terminated under this
paragraph 5.3, Heli-One shall provide to the Executive the accrued
benefits described in paragraph 5.2, including any death or
disability benefits due, and shall have no further compensation and
benefits obligations to the Executive under this
Agreement.

5.4 Termination for Death or
Disability . The Executive’s employment under this
Agreement shall terminate upon the death of the Executive or upon
the date specified by Heli-One in a Notice of Termination in
connection with the Executive’s Total Disability. Although
Heli-One will attempt to accommodate any disability suffered by the
Executive, Heli-One and the Executive recognize it is a fundamental
term of this Agreement that the Executive be able to attend
meetings and conduct business in British Columbia (or future
locations of a CHC head office) and to engage in reasonable
business travel globally. The Executive acknowledges and agrees
that, given the nature of Heli-One’s and CHC’s business
and the critical importance of the Executive’s position in
the operations of Heli-One and CHC, it would constitute an
unreasonable accommodation on the part of Heli-One to operate
without the services of the Executive for more than one hundred and
twenty (120) consecutive days or for more than one hundred and
eighty (180) non-consecutive days in any twelve
(12) consecutive months. Further, the Executive acknowledges
that it would be impractical for Heli-One to hire a replacement for
the Executive, unless the replacement is hired on a permanent
basis. If the Executive’s employment is terminated under this
paragraph 5.4, Heli-One shall provide to the Executive (or to the
Executive’s estate in the event of death) the accrued
benefits described in paragraph 5.2, including any death or
disability benefits due, and shall have no further compensation and
benefits obligations to the Executive under this
Agreement.

5.5 Termination by Heli-One Other
than for Cause, Disability or Death .

(a) Heli-One may terminate the
employment of the Executive for reasons other than for Cause or
death or Total Disability by providing the Executive Notice of
Termination, and upon such termination Heli-One shall provide to
the Executive, in addition to the accrued benefits described in
paragraph 5.2:

(i) A lump sum amount in lieu of any
bonus payable under the STIP for the year of termination,
determined as set forth below and prorated based upon the number of
days in the plan year prior to the termination date, divided by
365, to be paid the same time any STIP Bonus for such plan year
would have been paid had the Executive’s employment
continued. The prorated bonus shall be based on the average bonus
earned by the Executive under the STIP in each of the two years
immediately preceding the year in which the termination occurred.
In the event the Executive is terminated prior to completing two
years of service, the prorated bonus shall be calculated based on
the prior year bonus under the STIP and in the event the Executive
is terminated prior to completing one year of service, the
pro-rated bonus shall be based on the target bonus under the STIP
for the uncompleted year of service;
 
5



(ii) a lump sum severance payment
equal to twelve (12) months of the Executive’s then Base
Salary, payable sixty (60) days following the termination
date;

(iii) payment on the
Executive’s behalf of the applicable premium for health care
continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA for a period of twelve
(12) months or until the Executive ceases to be eligible for
COBRA continuation coverage, if earlier.

(b) The Executive understands and
agrees that prior to receiving the payments and benefits described
in this paragraph 5.5, the Executive must sign within fifty
(50) days of the termination date, and not revoke, a
separation agreement in a form satisfactory to Heli-One, including
a general release of claims; provided, that if such fifty (50)-day
period spans more than one taxable year of the Executive, any
payments set forth above will be made in the second of such taxable
years.

5.6 Termination by Executive for
Good Reason . Upon the occurrence of a Good Reason event, at
the Executive’s election, of which the Executive shall advise

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
