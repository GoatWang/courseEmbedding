Education















About










What I Do






I’m comfortable with all stages of product dev, but I love defining the problem and distilling a complicated concept into a simple one. As someone who has previously worked in business/ops, I always keep the overall ecosystem of a product in mind and consider what each user action triggers.


Describe what you have done, what you are doing, and the kinds of things you are interested in.









Achievements






I led the launch of the first ZeroCater satellite office in New York City. I worked with the heads of each department to coordinate the launch and then led the six-person San Francisco based launch team to New York to get operations up and running before leaving it in the hands of the replacement team we hired and trained. I also worked with the engineering team to add in new features that would enable us to operate in multiple timezones and additional types of client inputs. By the time we wrapped up in New York, we had doubled the amount of servings month to month to end up at 12,000 servings a month, and we had won over major accounts such as Buzzfeed and Foursquare from our competitors.


Describe the most impressive thing you've done.

Alfred Hitchcock playfully explores the role of the voyeur in one of his best-loved suspense thrillers. After breaking his leg during a shoot, photo-journalist L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is forced to spend a humid summer recuperating in his Greenwich Village apartment. The wheelchair-bound Jeff whiles away his time observing his neighbours through a telephoto lens, bestowing them with nicknames and growing familiar with their daily routines. However, his society girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) is exasperated and then alarmed when Jeff becomes obsessed with the notion that Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who lives in the apartment opposite, has murdered his wife. A 53-minute making of feature, 'Rear Window Ethics', is also included.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsWonderful film, taking place on the same set throughoutByMargaret Kon 17 March 2015Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseWonderful film, taking place on the same set throughout, like a stage play. None the worst for this though.very menacing at times, style introduced by Grace Kelly, what dresses! What a cool blonde! Only thing I have against her is that she plays the same character in every film, and with amazing woodeness not achieved by any other actor before or since. Nice to look at and she makes her male lead work harder than they ever had to do before. Great film thoughRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA unic gemByMr. T. Molnardon 17 January 2014Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseRear window proves that there's no need to rush at 160 miles per hour to make a good thriller. The main character, played by James Stewart, has a broken leg in plaster (courtesy of Hitchcock at the end of the film he has both legs broken...), so his movements are more than limited, still the film will keep you excited and delighted. Grace Kelly has never been more beautiful.Full of Hitchcock's humour.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByAmazon Customeron 5 June 2017Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseGreat product excellent price many thanks BrianRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsAnother Film that I really enjoyed, James Stewart plays a great partByMrs Whiscombeon 19 March 2016Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseAnother Film that I really enjoyed, James Stewart plays a great part, I just love it. it's got a good story line a great film to watch with your feet up on a Sunday afternoonRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByAmazon Customeron 5 June 2017Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseSlow but a great film.

Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
