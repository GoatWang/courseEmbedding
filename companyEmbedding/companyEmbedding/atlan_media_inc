Letter from The Chairman
WOULD THEY KNOW US?
Our Boston Beginning
On a Tuesday afternoon, May 5, 1857, magazine publisher Moses Phillips convened a five-hour meeting of some consequence – to us – of New England’s leading literary minds. Gathered at the Parker House Hotel were, among a few others, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. With their concept, and Phillips’ capital, the group decided to launch The Atlantic Monthly magazine.

In part, the men (later joined by Harriet Beecher Stowe) sought a national publication for their writings against slavery. More generally, and in the words of The Atlantic’s modern-era editor, Cullen Murphy, the magazine was “an attempt to define and create a distinctly American voice: to project an American stance, to promote something that might be called the American Idea.”
In the Pantheon
The Atlantic founders are in the pantheon of great American minds of the 19th century. And, drafting a founding “Declaration,” they were about high purpose: “In politics, The Atlantic Monthly will be the organ of no party or clique, but will honestly endeavor to be the exponent of what its conductors believe to be the American Idea… It will not rank itself with any sect of anties: but with that body of men which is in favor of Freedom, National Progress, and Honor…”
…and, in the Fray
How much do I concede in admitting that, at least, my work at Atlantic Media feels some many rungs down life’s ladder – less pantheon, more fray. At its founding, The Atlantic Monthly weighed in on the great issues of the era at the stately pace of 11 articles per month. Across our several titles – more digital than print – (The Atlantic, CityLab, National Journal, Government Executive, Quartz, Defense One) Atlantic Media now publishes 220 articles and posts every day. At a rate of 80,000 pieces per year, some are about freedom, national purpose and honor. http://www.atlanticmedia.com/about/ http://www.atlanticmedia.com/about/ http://www.atlanticmedia.com/about/Some, less so. Writing high, writing low, writing for the moment and, on occasion, for all time, Atlantic Media feels very much in the bustle of life of its 22 million global readers.
So, Would They Know Us?
Were Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, and Holmes to return for a term, would they recognize their mark in us? Would they click on our sites and mark them as favorites?
Well, there is this. As in 1857, The Atlantic – and now its sister titles – writes for the single most-educated readership in the United States. And, our Atlantic Media writers hold, as close to religious faith, two tenets that date to our founding:
(1) That, considering issues honestly, wholly on their merit, we are in service of “no party or clique;” and
(2) That in our writing, as in the nation’s life more broadly, it is ideas that matter most.
So, would they know us? Well, some of us more than others; likely, I’d be out, calling on advertisers.  But we would know them and, mostly proud, want to walk them through our work.

The principal purposes of our initial public offering are to create a public
market for our common stock and thereby enable future access to the public
equity markets by us and our employees, obtain additional capital, and
facilitate an orderly distribution of shares for the selling stockholders. We
intend to use the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes; however we do not have any
specific uses of the net proceeds planned.
 
Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.05. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $500,000 as
anticipated. The Company current has cash on hand sufficient to meet all
anticipated expenses for at least twelve months.


Our closest competition is a company called OpenX. OpenX is a Real Time Bidding
Exchange. The difference between us and OpenX is that our platform includes all
features in one offering. OpenX breaks up different ad types and charges a
minimum spend for each type (mobile, desktop, video). Atlan Media™ will takeaway
a lot of business from OpenX for this reason alone.


Company Description
We are a development stage company with operations and assets consistent with
our age, with a focus on early-stage business activities such as proof of
concept development, and promoting our new technology. Since incorporation,
management has developed a detailed business plan and capitalized the


 Company
with a cash infusion of $1,633,484. On May 6, 2016, our platform exited Beta
testing and became operational and available for purchase. At this time we have
6 paying clients.

Digital Media Buyers & Sellers are hungry for options that are fast, reliable,
flexible, fully managed, with tools and support to effectively and efficiently
run successful campaigns. Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost per 1000 Impressions
(CPM) premium traffic is in demand. The strong demand for our product as
highlighted herein is based on management beliefs, our experience and knowledge
within the marketplace, and feedback by potential clients via social networking
properties such as Linkedin and Crunchbase, for a complete product with complete
features without the additional expense of paying for ad serving. Management
have also surmised there is a need for our platform versus current offerings as
it includes all typical features found in advertising technology, within one
platform, and without the presence of any upfront cost or lock in contract.

Our new service and web-based advertising management platform offers Agencies,
Media Buyers, and Corporates access to over 70% of comScore top 100 websites of
the world in one easy to use platform. We achieve this via exchange partnerships
with Google, Epom, OpenX, and more.  These exchange partnerships do not require
a separate Contract, and are applied for and approved directly through the
websites of each exchange partner. They are agreed by “ticking” a button when
joining the programs. Below are the URL links to each website, and their General
Terms & Conditions:

1. Google: https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms

3. OpenX: http://openx.com/legal/ad-exchange-terms-conditions/

We expect our strongest market segments to be large Online Digital Media
Agencies in Major World centres including New York City, Sydney, London, Hong
Kong, Dubai. According to our research there is more than 1200 Agencies in these
five cities alone.

Atlantic Media, Inc. Company Profile

   Atlantic Media's truth is marching on. Atlantic Media Company's flagship publication,
   
    The Atlantic
   
   , was founded in Boston in 1857 by a group of writers that included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and was the first to publish the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Consultant David Bradley bought the magazine from publisher and real-estate magnate Mort Zuckerman in 1999 and installed Michael Kelly as editor. Kelly shifted the magazine from a literary to a news focus. He was killed covering Iraq in 2003. In order to cut costs, in 2005 Bradley moved operations from Boston to Washington, DC, home of his National Journal Group, which now operates under Atlantic Media.

The principal purposes of our initial public offering are to create a public
market for our common stock and thereby enable future access to the public
equity markets by us and our employees, obtain additional capital, and
facilitate an orderly distribution of shares for the selling stockholders. We
intend to use the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes; however we do not have any
specific uses of the net proceeds planned.
 
Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.05. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $500,000 as
anticipated. The Company current has cash on hand sufficient to meet all
anticipated expenses for at least twelve months.


Our closest competition is a company called OpenX. OpenX is a Real Time Bidding
Exchange. The difference between us and OpenX is that our platform includes all
features in one offering. OpenX breaks up different ad types and charges a
minimum spend for each type (mobile, desktop, video). Atlan Media™ will takeaway
a lot of business from OpenX for this reason alone.


Company Description
We are a development stage company with operations and assets consistent with
our age, with a focus on early-stage business activities such as proof of
concept development, and promoting our new technology. Since incorporation,
management has developed a detailed business plan and capitalized the


 Company
with a cash infusion of $1,633,484. On May 6, 2016, our platform exited Beta
testing and became operational and available for purchase. At this time we have
6 paying clients.
---

Digital Media Buyers & Sellers are hungry for options that are fast, reliable,
flexible, fully managed, with tools and support to effectively and efficiently
run successful campaigns. Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost per 1000 Impressions
(CPM) premium traffic is in demand. The strong demand for our product as
highlighted herein is based on management beliefs, our experience and knowledge
within the marketplace, and feedback by potential clients via social networking
properties such as Linkedin and Crunchbase, for a complete product with complete
features without the additional expense of paying for ad serving. Management
have also surmised there is a need for our platform versus current offerings as
it includes all typical features found in advertising technology, within one
platform, and without the presence of any upfront cost or lock in contract.

Our new service and web-based advertising management platform offers Agencies,
Media Buyers, and Corporates access to over 70% of comScore top 100 websites of
the world in one easy to use platform. We achieve this via exchange partnerships
with Google, Epom, OpenX, and more.  These exchange partnerships do not require
a separate Contract, and are applied for and approved directly through the
websites of each exchange partner. They are agreed by “ticking” a button when
joining the programs. Below are the URL links to each website, and their General
Terms & Conditions:

1. Google: https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms
                                                          
2. Epom: https://epom.com/terms-service
                                        
3. OpenX: http://openx.com/legal/ad-exchange-terms-conditions/

We expect our strongest market segments to be large Online Digital Media
Agencies in Major World centres including New York City, Sydney, London, Hong
Kong, Dubai. According to our research there is more than 1200 Agencies in these
five cities alone.
