An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement that will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization and also provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments.
But, as with most things in life, an annuity does have limitations. If you decide to take your money out early, you may face fees called surrender charges. Plus, if you're not yet age 59½, you may also have to pay an additional 10% tax penalty on top of ordinary income taxes. Naturally, if you do take an early withdrawal, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced. 
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal. 
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company and it’s sold by prospectus. While it may take some time, you should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you.  Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees, and the expense of the underlying investment options.  
Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase. 
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.

It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.The value of an investment in the variable account is measured in units. The value of each unit will rise or fall each business day depending on the investment performance. The value reflects all investment performance, management advisory fees, portfolio expenses, charges for insurance and administration, as well as automatic reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. For fixed annuities, the unit value is based on the annual effective yield.Compare unit value information with the performance reports on this website.NFW-6065AO

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.The value of an investment in the variable account is measured in units. The value of each unit will rise or fall each business day depending on the investment performance. The value reflects all investment performance, management advisory fees, portfolio expenses, charges for insurance and administration, as well as automatic reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. For fixed annuities, the unit value is based on the annual effective yield.Compare unit value information with the performance reports on this website.NFW-6065AO

General
  Information and History
�
The
  Nationwide Variable Account-II is a separate investment account of Nationwide
  Life Insurance Company ("Nationwide"). Nationwide is a member of the Nationwide
  group of companies. All of Nationwide's common stock is owned by Nationwide
  Financial Services, Inc. ("NFS"), a holding company. NFS has two classes of
  common stock outstanding with different voting rights enabling Nationwide
  Corporation (the holder of all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock) to
  control NFS. Nationwide Corporation is a holding company, as well. All of its
  common stock is held by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (95.2%) and
  Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (4.8%), the ultimate controlling
  persons of the Nationwide group of companies. The Nationwide group of companies
  is one of America�s largest insurance and financial services family of
  companies, with combined assets of over $158 billion as of December 31,
2005.
�
Services
�
Nationwide,
  which has responsibility for administration of the contracts and the variable
  account, maintains records of the name, address, taxpayer identification number,
  and other pertinent information for each contract owner and the number and
  type
  of contract issued to each contract owner and records with respect to the
  contract value.
�
The
  custodian of the assets of the variable account is Nationwide. Nationwide will
  maintain a record of all purchases and redemptions of shares of the underlying
  mutual funds. Nationwide, or affiliates of Nationwide, may have entered into
  agreements with either the investment adviser or distributor for the underlying
  mutual funds. The agreements relate to administrative services furnished by
  Nationwide or an affiliate of Nationwide. Some of the services provided include
  distribution of underlying fund prospectuses, semi-annual and annual fund
  reports, proxy materials and fund communications, as well as maintaining the
  websites and voice response systems necessary for contract owners to execute
  trades in the funds. Nationwide also acts as a limited agent for the fund for
  purposes of accepting the trades. For these services the funds agree to pay
  Nationwide an annual fee based on the average aggregate net assets of the
  variable account (and other separate accounts of Nationwide or life insurance
  company subsidiaries of Nationwide) invested in the particular fund.

�
Nationwide
  takes these anticipated fee payments into consideration when it determines
  the
  charges that will be assessed under the contracts. Without these payments,
  contract charges would be higher. Only those underlying mutual funds that agree
  to pay Nationwide a fee will be offered in the contract. Generally, Nationwide
  expects to receive somewhere between 0.10% to 0.45% (an annualized rate of
  the
  daily net assets of the variable account) from the funds it offers in the
  contracts. What is actually received depends upon many factors, including but
  not limited to the type of fund (i.e., money market funds generally pay less
  revenue than other fund types) and the actual services rendered to the fund
  company. Nationwide does not consider these fee payments when determining fund
  availability associated with any of the optional benefits offered in the
  contract.
�
Distribution,
  Promotional, and Sales Expenses
�
In
  addition to or partially in lieu of commission, Nationwide may pay the selling
  firms a marketing allowance, which is based on the firm�s ability and
  demonstrated willingness to promote and market Nationwide's products. How any
  marketing allowance is spent is determined by the firm, but generally will
  be
  used to finance firm activities, such as training and education, that may
  contribute to the promotion and marketing of Nationwide's products. Nationwide
  makes certain assumptions about the amount of marketing allowance it will pay
  and takes these assumptions into consideration when it determines the charges
  that will be assessed under the contracts. For the contracts described in the
  prospectus, Nationwide assumed 0.50% (of the daily net assets of the variable
  account) for marketing allowance when determining the charges for the contracts.
  The actual amount of the marketing allowance may be higher or lower than this
  assumption. If the actual amount of marketing allowance paid is more than what
  was assumed, Nationwide will fund the 
�
�
�

















difference.
  Nationwide generally does not profit from any excess marketing allowance if
  the
  amount assumed was higher than what is actually paid. Any excess would be spent
  on additional marketing for the contracts. For more information about marketing
  allowance or how a particular selling firm uses marketing allowances, please
  consult with your registered representative.

  27.�Number

The
  number of Contract Owners of Qualified and Non-Qualified Contracts as of
  February 14, 2006 was 15,397 and 9,254 respectively.
�
�
Item
  28.�Indemnification
�
Provision
  is made in Nationwide�s Amended and Restated Code of Regulations and expressly
  authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio, for
  indemnification by Nationwide of any person who was or is a party or is
  threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
  suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
  by
  reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee
  of
  Nationwide, against expenses, including attorneys fees, judgments, fines and
  amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person
  in
  connection with such action, suit or proceeding, to the extent and under the
  circumstances permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
  Ohio.
�
Insofar
  as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933
  ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
  Nationwide pursuant to the foregoing provisions, Nationwide has been informed
  that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
  indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
  therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
  such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
  or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
  successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
  director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
  registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
  has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
  jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
  policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
  of
  such issue.

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.
