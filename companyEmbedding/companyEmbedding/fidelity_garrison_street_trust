	The One Fund You Should Own in Your 401k
Plus, we look at a couple other Fidelity funds that can augment your existing portfolio

The 12 Best Fidelity 401k Funds to Own


						View All Posts
					








Funds You Should Buy for Your 401k
My aim is to deliver a lot more than a “will suffice” or “better than none” solution. My top picks for any investor’s 401k plan are:
Fidelity Strategic Dividend & Income Fund (MUTF:FSDIX)
Strategic Dividend & Income is a top pick, whether you can only own one fund (not likely), or as the one fund I’d suggest adding to your existing mix to better cover your growth and income bases.
FSDIX provides lead manager Joanna Bewick a lot of investing leeway: roughly 50% common stocks, 15% REITs or other real estate investments, 15% convertibles and 20% preferred stocks. Foreign investments make up 4.5% of the holdings.
From a sector breakdown, financials (28.6%), information technology (10.7%) and healthcare (10.6%) get the heaviest weights, though the top two individual weights go to energy stocks Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).
FSDIX has been a stalwart performer for years, ranking in the top five of all category funds in one-, three- and five-year performance, according to Morningstar. Meanwhile, expenses are 0.77%, or $77 annually for every $10,000 invested.
Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX)
Manager Eddie Yoon invests in companies involved in the design, production, sale and servicing of everything under healthcare’s sun — pharmaceuticals, biotechs, medical supplies and technology, hospitals and more. Eddie invests with an eye on the necessary demographic trends of aging boomers here and globally, but he is also keyed into the often overlooked trend of emerging markets minting new classes of consumers demanding not just better food and shelter, but better healthcare products and services.
Top holdings include a little bit of everything, from biopharma outfit Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) to diversified pharma Allergan, Inc. (NYSE:AGN) to devices maker Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX).
Lower risk and higher returns are the hallmark of healthcare’s growth stock lot: FSPHX has roughly doubled the S&P 500 over every meaningful time period. And like FSDIX, Fidelity Select Health Care charges 0.77% in fees.
Fidelity Strategic Real Return (MUTF:FSRRX)
Primary manager Joanna Bewick (yup, she also manages FSDIX above) again uses an investment allocation guide for this fund.
Bewick invests in approximately 30% inflation-protected, 25% floating-rate, 25% commodity, and 20% REITs or other real estate investments — all exclusively domestic. The top five bond issuers are the United States Treasury, Fidelity Garrison Street Trust, Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), Stanley Martin Communities, and Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE:BXP).
This fund will complement a core diversified bond fund like Pimco Total Return Fund (MUTF:PTTAX), Fidelity Total Bond (MUTF:FTBFX) or Vanguard’s Total Bond Index (MUTF:VBMFX).
Think of FSRRX as a kind of a hedge against inflation; correlating more with a basket of commodities (definitely not just oil, but think more broadly of cattle, corn, soy beans, cocoa, coffee) prices than either stocks or bonds, making it a unique diversifier for most 401k portfolios.
FSRRX also charges 0.77% in fees.

Fund Basics
Investment Details

Investment Objective

Money Market Central Fund seeks to obtain a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.

Principal Investment Strategies

Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (FIMM) invests the fund's assets in U.S. dollar-denominated money market securities of domestic and
foreign issuers and repurchase agreements. FIMM also may enter into reverse repurchase agreements for the fund.

FIMM will invest more than 25% of the fund's total assets in the financial services industries.

In buying and selling securities for the fund, FIMM complies with industry-standard requirements for money market funds regarding the quality, maturity,
and diversification of the fund's investments. FIMM stresses maintaining a stable $1.00 share price, liquidity, and income.

Description of Principal Security Types

Money market securities are high-quality, short-term securities that pay a fixed, variable, or floating interest rate. Securities are often specifically
structured so that they are eligible investments for a money market fund. For example, in order to satisfy the maturity restrictions for a money market
fund, some money market securities have demand or put features, which have the effect of shortening the security's maturity. Money market securities
include bank certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, bank time deposits, notes, commercial paper, and U.S. Government securities.

A repurchase agreement is an agreement to buy a security at one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreed-upon price.

Principal Investment Risks

<R>Many factors affect the fund's performance. The fund's yield will change daily based on changes in interest rates and other market conditions.
Although the fund is managed to maintain a stable $1.00 share price, there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to do so. For example, a major
increase in interest rates or a decrease in the credit quality of the issuer of one of the fund's investments could cause the fund's share price to decrease.
</R>

The following factors can significantly affect the fund's performance:

Interest Rate Changes. Money market securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general, the price of a money market
security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall. Securities with longer maturities and the securities of issuers in the
financial services sector can be more sensitive to interest rate changes. Short-term securities tend to react to changes in short-term interest rates.

Foreign Exposure. Issuers located in foreign countries and entities providing credit support or a maturity-shortening structure that are located in
foreign countries can involve increased risks. Extensive public information about the issuer or provider may not be available and unfavorable
political, economic, or governmental developments could affect the value of the security.

Financial Services Exposure. Financial services companies are highly dependent on the supply of short-term financing. The value of securities of
issuers in the financial services sector can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and to economic downturns in the
United States and abroad.

Issuer-Specific Changes. Changes in the financial condition of an issuer, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a
particular type of issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an issuer's securities.
Entities providing credit support or a maturity-shortening structure also can be affected by these types of changes. If the structure of a security fails
to function as intended, the security could decline in value.

Fundamental Investment Policies

The policy discussed below is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by shareholder approval.

Prospectus

Fund Basics - continued

Money Market Central Fund seeks to obtain a high level of current income consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.

Valuing Shares

The fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.

The fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. Fidelity normally calculates the fund's NAV as of the close of business of the
NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. However, NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the NYSE is restricted or as permitted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund's assets are valued as of this time for the purpose of computing the fund's NAV.

To the extent that the fund's assets are traded in other markets on days when the fund is not open for business, the value of the fund's assets may be
affected on those days. In addition, trading in some of the fund's assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business.

The fund's assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information
Buying and Selling Shares

Buying Shares

The fund offers its shares to other investment companies and accounts managed by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) or its affiliates.
Shares of the fund are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any "public offering" within the meaning of Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933 Act). Investments in the fund may be made only by a limited number of institutional investors including
investment companies, banks, insurance companies, and certain other "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act.
This registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any shares of the fund.

The price to buy one share of the fund is the fund's NAV. The fund's shares are sold without a sales charge.

Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form.

The fund reserves the right to reject any specific purchase order. Purchase orders may be refused if, in FIMM's opinion, they would disrupt
management of the fund.

The fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently.

When you place an order to buy shares, note the following:


All of your purchases must be made by federal funds wire; checks and Automated Clearing House System (ACH) payments will not be accepted.
All wires must be received in proper form by Fidelity at the applicable fund's designated wire bank before the close of the Federal Reserve Wire
System on the day of purchase or you could be liable for any losses or fees the fund or Fidelity has incurred or for interest and penalties.

Selling Shares 

The price to sell one share of the fund is the fund's NAV.

Your shares will be sold at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form.

When you place an order to sell shares, note the following:


Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next business day, but may take up to seven days to <R>be</R> process<R>ed</R> if making
immediate payment would adversely affect the fund.
Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE
is restricted, or as permitted by the SEC.
Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather than in cash if FIMM determines it is in the best interests of the fund.

Account Policies

Policies

The following policy applies to you as a shareholder.


Fidelity will send monthly account statements detailing account balances and all transactions completed during the prior month.

Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions

The fund earns interest, dividends, and other income from its investments, and distributes this income (less expenses) to shareholders as dividends.
The fund may also realize capital gains from its investments, and distributes these gains (less losses), if any, to shareholders as capital gain
distributions.

Distributions you receive from the fund consist primarily of dividends. The fund normally declares dividends daily and pays them monthly.

As a non-publicly offered registered investment company, the fund may be required to report distributions of "phantom income" to affected
shareholders.

Earning Dividends

Shares begin to earn dividends on the day of purchase.

Prospectus

Shareholder Information - continued

Shares earn dividends through the day prior to the day of redemption.

Distribution Option 

Your dividends and capital gain distributions, if any, will be paid in cash or, at your election, automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund.

Tax Consequences

As with any investment, your investment in the fund could have tax consequences for you.

Distributions you receive from the fund are subject to federal income tax, and may also be subject to state or local taxes.

For federal tax purposes, <R>certain of </R>the fund's <R>distributions, including </R>dividends and distributions of short-term capital <R>gains,
</R>are taxable to you as ordinary income, while <R>certain of </R>the fund's <R>distributions, including </R>distributions of long-term capital
gains, if any, are taxable to you generally as capital gains.

Any taxable distributions you receive from the fund will normally be taxable to you when you receive them; however, you will receive certain December
distributions in January, but those distributions will be taxable as if you received them on December 31.

Fund Services
Fund Management

Money Market Central Fund is a mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders' money and invests it toward a specified goal.

FIMM is the fund's manager.

As of January 31, 2001, FIMM had approximately $300 billion in discretionary assets under management. FIMM's principal business address is One
Spartan Way, Merrimack, New Hampshire.

As the manager, FIMM is responsible for choosing the fund's investments and handling its business affairs.

From time to time a manager, analyst, or other Fidelity employee may express views regarding a particular company, security, industry, or market
sector. The views expressed by any such person are the views of only that individual as of the time expressed and do not necessarily represent the views
of Fidelity or any other person in the Fidelity organization. Any such views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and
Fidelity disclaims any responsibility to update such views. These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for
a Fidelity fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Fidelity fund.

Pursuant to the fund's management contract with FIMM, FMR, on behalf of the fund, pays FIMM a management fee. The management fee is
calculated and paid to FIMM every month.

For each fund (other than a fund for which FIMM serves as sub-adviser) that invests in the fund in a given month, FMR pays FIMM a fee equal to
50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that FMR receives from the investing fund, multiplied by the
average net assets invested by that fund in the fund for the month. The fee is reduced to reflect any expenses paid by FMR on behalf of an investing
fund pursuant to an all-inclusive fee management contract, but is not reduced to reflect any fee waivers or expense re-imbursements made by FMR.



FMR may, from time to time, agree to reimburse the fund for other expenses above a specified limit. FMR retains the ability to be repaid by the fund if
expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal year. Reimbursement arrangements, which may be discontinued by FMR at any time,
can decrease the fund's expenses and boost its performance.

As of September 30, 2001, 100% of the fund's total outstanding shares was held by mutual funds managed by FMR or an FMR affiliate.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS

The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in Part A of the registration statement. Unless otherwise noted, whenever an
investment policy or limitation states a maximum percentage of the fund's assets that may be invested in any security or other asset, or sets forth a policy
regarding quality standards, such standard or percentage limitation will be determined immediately after and as a result of the fund's acquisition of such
security or other asset. Accordingly, any subsequent change in values, net assets, or other circumstances will not be considered when determining
whether the investment complies with the fund's investment policies and limitations.

The fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be changed without approval by a "majority of the outstanding voting
securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)) of the fund. However, except for the fundamental investment
limitations listed below, the investment policies and limitations described in this Part B of the registration statement are not fundamental and may be
changed without shareholder approval.

The following are the fund's fundamental investment limitations set forth in their entirety. The fund may not:

(1)  purchase the securities of any issuer, if, as a result, the fund would not comply with the applicable diversification requirements for a money
market fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules thereunder, as such may be amended from time to time;

(2)  issue senior securities, except in connection with the insurance program established by the fund pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the
Securities and Exchange Commission or as otherwise permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940;

(3)  borrow money, except that the fund may (i) borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes (not for leveraging or investment) and
(ii) engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose; provided that (i) and (ii) in combination do not exceed 33 1/3% of the fund's total
assets (including the amount borrowed) less liabilities (other than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed this amount will be reduced
within three days (not including Sundays and holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;

(4)  underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities or in connection with investments in other investment companies;

(5)  purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its agencies or
instrumentalities, or securities of other investment companies) if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested in the
securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry, except that the fund will invest more than 25% of its total assets in
the financial services industry;

(6)  purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent the fund from
investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in the real estate business);

(7)  purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments; or

(8)  lend any security or make any other loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other parties, but this limitation
does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements, or to acquisitions of loans, loan participations or other forms of debt
instruments.

The following investment limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.

(i)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase a security (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities, or securities of other money market funds) if, as a result, more than 5% of its total assets would be invested in securities
of a single issuer; provided that the fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in the first tier securities of a single issuer for up to three business days.

(ii) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short, unless it owns or has the right to obtain securities equivalent in kind and amount to
the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures contracts and options are not deemed to constitute selling securities short.

(iii)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin, except that the fund may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary
for the clearance of transactions, and provided that margin payments in connection with futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall not
constitute purchasing securities on margin.

(iv) The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves
as investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with any party.

(v)  The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in securities that
are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be sold or disposed of in the
ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued.

(vi) The fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than securities to other parties, except by lending money (up to 15% of the fund's net
assets) to a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser. (This limitation does not apply to
purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements.)

For purposes of limitation (i), certain securities subject to guarantees (including insurance, letters of credit and demand features) are not
considered securities of their issuer, but are subject to separate diversification requirements, in accordance with industry standard requirements for
money market funds.

With respect to limitation (v), if through a change in values, net assets, or other circumstances, the fund were in a position where more than 10% of its
net assets were invested in illiquid securities, it would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity.

The following pages contain more detailed information about types of instruments in which the fund may invest, strategies Fidelity Investments
Money Management, Inc. (FIMM) may employ in pursuit of the fund's investment objective, and a summary of related risks. FIMM may not buy all
of these instruments or use all of these techniques unless it believes that doing so will help the fund achieve its goal.

Affiliated Bank Transactions. A fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are, or may be considered to be, "affiliated
persons" of the fund under the 1940 Act. These transactions may involve repurchase agreements with custodian banks; short-term obligations of, and
repurchase agreements with, the 50 largest U.S. banks (measured by deposits); municipal securities; U.S. Government securities with affiliated financial
institutions that are primary dealers in these securities; short-term currency transactions; and short-term borrowings. In accordance with exemptive
orders issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable
to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions.

Asset-Backed Securities represent interests in pools of mortgages, loans, receivables, or other assets. Payment of interest and repayment of
principal may be largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the assets backing the securities and, in certain cases, supported by letters of
credit, surety bonds, or other credit enhancements. Asset-backed security values may also be affected by other factors including changes in interest
rates, the availability of information concerning the pool and its structure, the creditworthiness of the servicing agent for the pool, the originator of the
loans or receivables, or the entities providing the credit enhancement. In addition, these securities may be subject to prepayment risk.

Borrowing. The fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) or its affiliates,
or through reverse repurchase agreements, and may make additional investments while borrowings are outstanding.

Cash Management. A fund can hold uninvested cash.

Central Funds are money market or short-term bond funds managed by FMR or its affiliates. The money market central funds seek to earn a high
level of current income (free from federal income tax in the case of a municipal money market fund) while maintaining a stable $1.00 share price. The
money market central funds comply with industry-standard requirements for money market funds regarding the quality, maturity, and diversification
of their investments. The short-term bond central funds seek to obtain a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital.

 Domestic and Foreign Investments include U.S. dollar-denominated time deposits, certificates of deposit, and bankers' acceptances of U.S.
banks and their branches located outside of the United States, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, and foreign branches of foreign banks.
Domestic and foreign investments may also include U.S. dollar-denominated securities issued or guaranteed by other U.S. or foreign issuers,
including U.S. and foreign corporations or other business organizations, foreign governments, foreign government agencies or instrumentalities, and
U.S. and foreign financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, and real estate investment
trusts, as well as banks.

The obligations of foreign branches of U.S. banks may be general obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing branch, or may be limited
by the terms of a specific obligation and by governmental regulation. Payment of interest and repayment of principal on these obligations may also be
affected by governmental action in the country of domicile of the branch (generally referred to as sovereign risk). In addition, evidence of ownership
of portfolio securities may be held outside of the United States and a fund may be subject to the risks associated with the holding of such property
overseas. Various provisions of federal law governing the establishment and operation of U.S. branches do not apply to foreign branches of U.S.
banks.

Obligations of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may be general obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing branch, or may
be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by federal and state regulation, as well as by governmental action in the country in which the
foreign bank has its head office.

Obligations of foreign issuers involve certain additional risks. These risks may include future unfavorable political and economic developments,
withholding taxes, seizures of foreign deposits, currency controls, interest limitations, or other governmental restrictions that might affect repayment
of principal or payment of interest, or the ability to honor a credit commitment. Additionally, there may be less public information available about
foreign entities. Foreign issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation and supervision than U.S. issuers. Foreign issuers also generally are
not bound by uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. issuers.

Illiquid Securities cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued. Difficulty
in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund. Under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, FIMM determines the liquidity of a
fund's investments and, through reports from FIMM, the Board monitors investments in illiquid securities. In determining the liquidity of a fund's
investments, FIMM may consider various factors, including (1) the frequency and volume of trades and quotations, (2) the number of dealers and
prospective purchasers in the marketplace, (3) dealer undertakings to make a market, and (4) the nature of the security and the market in which it trades
(including any demand, put or tender features, the mechanics and other requirements for transfer, any letters of credit or other credit enhancement
features, any ratings, the number of holders, the method of soliciting offers, the time required to dispose of the security, and the ability to assign or
offset the rights and obligations of the security).

<R>Interfund Borrowing and Lending Program. Pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, a fund may lend money to, and borrow
money from, other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates. A fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the
cost of bank loans, and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase
agreements. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight, but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one
day's notice. A fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed. Any delay in repayment to a
lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs. </R>

Money Market Securities are high-quality, short-term obligations. Money market securities may be structured to be, or may employ a trust or
other form so that they are, eligible investments for money market funds. For example, put features can be used to modify the maturity of a security or
interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance price stability. If a structure fails to function as intended, adverse tax or investment
consequences may result. Neither the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) nor any other regulatory authority has ruled definitively on certain legal issues
presented by certain structured securities. Future tax or other regulatory determinations could adversely affect the value, liquidity, or tax treatment of
the income received from these securities or the nature and timing of distributions made by the fund.

Municipal Securities are issued to raise money for a variety of public or private purposes, including general financing for state and local
governments, or financing for specific projects or public facilities. They may be issued in anticipation of future revenues and may be backed by the full
taxing power of a municipality, the revenues from a specific project, or the credit of a private organization. The value of some or all municipal
securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or
the rights of municipal securities holders. A municipal security may be owned directly or through a participation interest.

Put Features entitle the holder to sell a security back to the issuer or a third party at any time or at specified intervals. In exchange for this benefit, a
fund may accept a lower interest rate. Securities with put features are subject to the risk that the put provider is unable to honor the put feature
(purchase the security). Put providers often support their ability to buy securities on demand by obtaining letters of credit or other guarantees from
other entities. Demand features, standby commitments, and tender options are types of put features.

Repurchase Agreements involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreed-upon price.
The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased
security. As protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation, the securities are held in a separate account at a bank,
marked-to-market daily, and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount. The value of the security
purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security. In addition, delays or losses could result if
the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent. The fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose
creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FIMM.

Restricted Securities are subject to legal restrictions on their sale. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to a fund. Restricted
securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the 1933
Act), or in a registered public offering. Where registration is required, the holder of a registered security may be obligated to pay all or part of the
registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a
security under an effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, the holder might obtain a less
favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security.

Reverse Repurchase Agreements. In a reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells a security to another party, such as a bank or broker-dealer, in
return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreed-upon price and time. The fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with
parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FIMM. Such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value
of fund assets and a fund's yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage.

Short Sales "Against the Box" are short sales of securities that a fund owns or has the right to obtain (equivalent in kind or amount to the
securities sold short). Short sales against the box could be used to protect the net asset value per share (NAV) of the fund in anticipation of increased
interest rates, without sacrificing the current yield of the securities sold short. If a fund enters into a short sale against the box, it will be required to set
aside securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short (or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities) and will be
required to hold such securities while the short sale is outstanding. The fund will incur transaction costs in connection with opening and closing short
sales against the box.

Sources of Liquidity or Credit Support. Issuers may employ various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements, including letters of credit,
guarantees, puts, and demand features, and insurance provided by domestic or foreign entities such as banks and other financial institutions. FIMM may
rely on its evaluation of the credit of the liquidity or credit enhancement provider in determining whether to purchase a security supported by such
enhancement. In evaluating the credit of a foreign bank or other foreign entities, FIMM will consider whether adequate public information about the
entity is available and whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments, currency controls, or other government
restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its commitment. Changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the enhancement could affect the
value of the security or a fund's share price.

Stripped Securities are the separate income or principal components of a debt security. The risks associated with stripped securities are similar to
those of other money market securities, although stripped securities may be more volatile. U.S. Treasury securities that have been stripped by a
Federal Reserve Bank are obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury.

Privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a U.S. Treasury security or other U.S. Government security with a
custodian for safekeeping. The custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment, which the dealer then sells.

Because the SEC does not consider privately stripped government securities to be U.S. Government securities for purposes of Rule 2a-7, a fund
must evaluate them as it would non-government securities pursuant to regulatory guidelines applicable to money market funds.

Variable and Floating Rate Securities provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security. Variable rate securities provide
for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate, while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a
designated benchmark rate or the issuer's credit quality. Some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to
demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries.

When-Issued and Forward Purchase or Sale Transactions involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined
price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security. Typically, no interest accrues to
the purchaser until the security is delivered.

When purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions, the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership, including the risks of
price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated. Because payment for the securities is not required until the
delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a fund's investments. If a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a
purchase is outstanding, the purchases may result in a form of leverage. When a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions, the fund
does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security. If the other party to a delayed-delivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for
the securities, a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss.

A fund may renegotiate a when-issued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery, which may result in capital
gains or losses for the fund.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the fund by FIMM pursuant to authority contained in the
management contract. FIMM may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other investment companies and investment
accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion. In selecting brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FIMM), FIMM generally
considers: the execution price; the size and type of the transaction; the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold; the
execution efficiency, settlement capability, and financial condition of the firm; the execution services rendered on a continuing basis; the
reasonableness of any commissions; and the provision of additional brokerage and research products and services.

Purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for their services.

Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees.

Ordinarily commissions are not charged on over-the-counter (OTC) orders because the fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the
security, and is the difference between the dealer's cost and the cost to the fund. When the fund executes an OTC order with an electronic
communications network, an alternative trading system, or a non-market maker, a commission is charged because there is no spread on the trade.

The fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that provide products and services. These products and services may include:
economic, industry, or company research reports or investment recommendations; subscriptions to financial publications or research data
compilations; compilations of securities prices, earnings, dividends, and similar data; computerized databases; quotation equipment and services;
research or analytical computer software and services; products or services that assist in effecting transactions, including services of third-party
computer systems developers directly related to research and brokerage activities; and effecting securities transactions and performing functions
incidental thereto (such as clearance and settlement). The receipt of these products and services has not reduced FIMM's normal research activities in
providing investment advice to the fund. FIMM's expenses could be increased, however, if it attempted to generate these additional products and
services through its own efforts.

Certain of the products and services FIMM receives from brokers or dealers are furnished by brokers or dealers on their own initiative, either in
connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services. In addition, FIMM may request a broker or dealer to provide a specific
proprietary or third-party product or service. While FIMM takes into account the products and services provided by a broker or dealer in determining
whether commissions are reasonable, neither FIMM nor the fund incurs an obligation to the broker, dealer, or third party to pay for any product or service
(or portion thereof) by generating a certain amount of commissions or otherwise.

Brokers or dealers that execute transactions for the fund on an agency basis may receive commissions that are in excess of the amount of
commissions that other brokers or dealers might have charged, in recognition of the products and services they have provided. Before causing the fund
to pay such higher commissions, FIMM will make a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the
products and services provided viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or FIMM's overall responsibilities to the fund or other
investment companies and investment accounts. Typically, these products and services assist FIMM or its affiliates in terms of its overall investment
responsibilities to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts; however, each product or service received may not benefit the
fund.

FIMM is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the distribution of shares of the fund
or other Fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that have provided such assistance. FIMM may place trades with
certain brokers with which it is under common control, including National Financial Services LLC (NFS) and Fidelity Brokerage Services (Japan)
LLC (FBSJ), provided it determines that these affiliates' products, services, and costs are comparable to those of non-affiliated, qualified brokerage
firms. FIMM may also place trades with REDIBook ECN LLC (REDIBook), an electronic communication network (ECN) in which a wholly-owned
subsidiary of FMR Corp. has an equity ownership interest, if the commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions charged by
non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms for similar services.

FIMM may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FIMM) who have entered into arrangements with FIMM
under which the broker-dealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the reduction of that fund's expenses. The transaction
quality must, however, be comparable to that of other qualified broker-dealers.

The Trustees of the fund periodically review FIMM's performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions
on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to
the benefits to the fund.

The fund may pay both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions. For the fiscal years ended September
30, 2001 and 2000, the fund paid no brokerage commissions.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the fund paid no brokerage commissions to firms for providing research services.

The Trustees of the fund have approved procedures in conformity with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act whereby a fund may purchase securities that
are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of FMR participates. These procedures prohibit the fund from directly or indirectly benefiting an
FMR affiliate in connection with such underwritings. In addition, for underwritings where an FMR affiliate participates as a principal underwriter,
certain restrictions may apply that could, among other things, limit the amount of securities that the fund could purchase in the underwritings.

From time to time the Trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the fund of some portion of the brokerage commissions or
similar fees paid by the fund on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable. The fund seeks to recapture soliciting broker-dealer fees on
the tender of portfolio securities, but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect. The Trustees intend to continue to review whether
recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and, if so, to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be
advisable for the fund to seek such recapture.

Although the Trustees and officers of the fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by FMR or its affiliates, investment
decisions for the fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts managed by FMR or its affiliates. The same security is
often held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts. Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and
investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser, particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more
than one fund or investment account.

When two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security, the prices and amounts are allocated in
accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable for each fund. In some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the
price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the fund to participate in volume transactions will
produce better executions and prices for the fund. It is the current opinion of the Trustees that the desirability of retaining FIMM as investment adviser
to the fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions.

VALUATION

The fund's NAV is the value of a single share. The NAV of the fund is computed by adding the value of the fund's investments, cash, and other
assets, subtracting its liabilities, and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding.

Portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost. This technique involves initially valuing an instrument at its cost as
adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value. The amortized cost value of an instrument may be
higher or lower than the price the fund would receive if it sold the instrument.

Securities of other open-end investment companies are valued at their respective NAVs.

At such intervals as they deem appropriate, the Trustees consider the extent to which NAV calculated by using market valuations would deviate
from the $1.00 per share calculated using amortized cost valuation. If the Trustees believe that a deviation from the fund's amortized cost per share
may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders, the Trustees have agreed to take such corrective action, if any, as they deem
appropriate to eliminate or reduce, to the extent reasonably practicable, the dilution or unfair results. Such corrective action could include selling
portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity; withholding dividends; redeeming
shares in kind; establishing NAV by using available market quotations; and such other measures as the Trustees may deem appropriate.

PERFORMANCE

The fund may quote performance in various ways. The fund's yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors.

Yield Calculations To compute the yield for the fund for a period, the net change in value of a hypothetical investment in one share reflects the
value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and any additional
shares. The net change is then divided by the value of the investment at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return. This base period
return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield. The fund also may calculate an effective yield by compounding the base period return over a
one-year period. In addition to the current yield, the fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical seven-day period. Yields for the fund
are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds, as required by applicable regulation.

Yield information may be useful in reviewing the fund's performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives.
However, the fund's yield fluctuates, unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time. When comparing investment
alternatives, investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to
consider.

Investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates the fund's yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates,
and in periods of rising interest rates the fund's yield will tend to be somewhat lower. Also, when interest rates are falling, the inflow of net new money
to the fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the fund's holdings,
thereby reducing the fund's current yield. In periods of rising interest rates, the opposite can be expected to occur.

Return Calculations. Returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of the fund's return, including the effect of reinvesting dividends and
capital gain distributions, and any change in the fund's NAV over a stated period. A cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period
of time. Average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in the fund over a
stated period, and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline
in value had been constant over the period. For example, a cumulative return of 100% over ten years would produce an average annual return of
7.18%, which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal 100% growth on a compounded basis in ten years. While average annual returns are a
convenient means of comparing investment alternatives, investors should realize that the fund's performance is not constant over time, but changes
from year to year, and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual year-to-year performance of the fund.

In addition to average annual returns, the fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment
over a stated period. Average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount, and may be calculated for a single
investment, a series of investments, or a series of redemptions, over any time period. Returns may be broken down into their components of income
and capital (including capital gains and changes in share price) to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return. Returns
may be quoted on a before-tax or after-tax basis. After-tax returns reflect the return of a hypothetical investment after payment of federal and/or state
taxes using assumed tax rates. After-tax returns may assume that taxes are paid at the time of distribution or once a year or are paid in cash or by selling
shares, that shares are held through the entire period, sold on the last day of the period, or sold at a future date, and distributions are reinvested or paid in
cash. Returns, yields and other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table, graph, or similar illustration.

The following table shows the income and capital elements of the fund's cumulative return. The table compares the fund's return to the record of
the Standard & Poor's 500SM  Index (S&P 500®), the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM  (DJIASM ), and the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer
Price Index (CPI), over the same period. The S&P 500 and DJIA comparisons are provided to show how the fund's return compared to the record of
a market capitalization-weighted index of common stocks and a narrower set of stocks of major industrial companies, respectively, over the same
period. Because the fund invests in short-term debt securities, common stocks represent a different type of investment from the fund. Common
stocks generally offer greater growth potential than the fund, but generally experience greater price volatility, which means greater potential for
loss. In addition, common stocks generally provide lower income than an investment such as the fund. The S&P 500 and DJIA returns are based on
the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and, unlike the fund's returns, do not include the effect of brokerage commissions or other costs of
investing.

During the period from July 24, 2000 (commencement of operations) to September 30, 2001, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in Money Market
Central would have grown to $10,683, assuming all distributions were reinvested. Returns are based on past results and are not an indication of future
performance. Tax consequences of different investments have not been factored into the figures below.

Explanatory Notes: With an initial investment of $10,000 in the fund on July 24, 2000, the net amount invested in fund shares was $10,000. The
cost of the initial investment ($10,000) together with the aggregate cost of reinvested dividends and capital gain distributions for the period covered
(their cash value at the time they were reinvested) amounted to $10,683. If distributions had not been reinvested, the amount of distributions earned
from the fund over time would have been smaller, and cash payments for the period would have amounted to $662 for dividends. The fund did not
distribute any capital gains during the period.

Performance Comparisons. The fund's performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in general, or to the
performance of particular types of mutual funds. These comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by Lipper Inc. (Lipper), an
independent service located in Summit, New Jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds. Generally, Lipper rankings are based on return,
assume reinvestment of distributions, do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration, and are prepared without regard to tax
consequences. Lipper may also rank based on yield. In addition to the mutual fund rankings, the fund's performance may be compared to stock, bond,
and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by Lipper or other organizations. When comparing these indexes, it is important to
remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment. For example, while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns,
they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility. Likewise, money market funds may offer greater stability of principal, but generally do not
offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds.

From time to time, the fund's performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and
periodicals. For example, the fund may quote Morningstar, Inc. in its advertising materials. Morningstar, Inc. is a mutual fund rating service that rates
mutual funds on the basis of risk-adjusted performance. Rankings that compare the performance of Fidelity funds to one another in appropriate
categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising.

The fund may be compared in advertising to Certificates of Deposit (CDs) or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions.
Mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects. For example, the fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than CDs,
the fund does not guarantee an investor's principal or return, and fund shares are not FDIC insured.

Fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand their investment goals and explore various financial strategies. Such
information may include information about current economic, market, and political conditions; materials that describe general principles of investing,
such as asset allocation, diversification, risk tolerance, and goal setting; questionnaires designed to help create a personal financial profile; worksheets
used to project savings needs based on assumed rates of inflation and hypothetical rates of return; and action plans offering investment alternatives.
Materials may also include discussions of Fidelity's asset allocation funds and other Fidelity funds, products, and services.

Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois (Ibbotson) provides historical returns of the capital markets in the United States, including common
stocks, small capitalization stocks, long-term corporate bonds, intermediate-term government bonds, long-term government bonds, Treasury bills,
the U.S. rate of inflation (based on the CPI), and combinations of various capital markets. The performance of these capital markets is based on the
returns of different indexes.

Fidelity funds may use the performance of these capital markets in order to demonstrate general risk-versus-reward investment scenarios.
Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment in any of these capital markets. The risks associated with the
security types in any capital market may or may not correspond directly to those of the funds. Ibbotson calculates returns in the same method as the
funds. The funds may also compare performance to that of other compilations or indexes that may be developed and made available in the future.

The money market fund may compare its performance or the performance of securities in which it may invest to averages published by
iMoneyNet, Inc. of Westborough, Massachusetts. These averages assume reinvestment of distributions. iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT
AVERAGES/All Taxable, which is reported in iMoneyNet's MONEY FUND REPORT, covers 1,102 taxable money market funds.

In advertising materials, Fidelity may reference or discuss its products and services, which may include other Fidelity funds; retirement investing;
brokerage products and services; model portfolios or allocations; saving for college or other goals; and charitable giving. In addition, Fidelity may
quote or reprint financial or business publications and periodicals as they relate to current economic and political conditions, fund management,
portfolio composition, investment philosophy, investment techniques, the desirability of owning a particular mutual fund, and Fidelity services and
products. Fidelity may also reprint, and use as advertising and sales literature, articles from Fidelity Focus®, a quarterly magazine provided free of
charge to Fidelity fund shareholders.

The fund may present its fund number, Quotron® number, and CUSIP number, and discuss or quote its current portfolio manager.

As of September 30, 2001, FMR advised over $44 billion in municipal fund assets, $197 billion in taxable fixed-income fund assets, $198 billion
in money market fund assets, $446 billion in equity fund assets, and $17 billion in international fund assets. The fund may reference the growth and
variety of money market mutual funds and the adviser's innovation and participation in the industry. The equity funds under management figure
represents the largest amount of equity fund assets under management by a mutual fund investment adviser in the United States, making FMR
America's leading equity (stock) fund manager. FMR, its subsidiaries, and affiliates maintain a worldwide information and communications network
for the purpose of researching and managing investments abroad.

In addition to performance rankings, the fund may compare its total expense ratio to the average total expense ratio of similar funds tracked by
Lipper. The fund's total expense ratio is a significant factor in comparing debt and money market investments because of its effect on yield.

BUYING AND SELLING INFORMATION

Shares of the fund are not offered to the public and are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any "public offering"
within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the fund may be made only by a limited number of institutional investors, including
investment companies, banks, insurance companies, and certain other entities that are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D
under the 1933 Act. This registration statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any "security" within the
meaning of the 1933 Act.

The fund may make redemption payments in whole or in part in readily marketable securities or other property pursuant to procedures approved by
the Trustees if FIMM determines it is in the best interests of the fund. Such securities or other property will be valued for this purpose as they are valued
in computing the fund's NAV. Shareholders that receive securities or other property will realize, upon receipt, a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will
incur additional costs and be exposed to market risk prior to and upon sale of such securities or other property.

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES

Dividends. Because the fund's income is primarily derived from interest, dividends from the fund generally will not qualify for the
dividends-received deduction available to corporate shareholders. Short-term capital gains are taxable as dividends, but do not qualify for the
dividends-received deduction. A portion of the fund's dividends derived from certain U.S. Government securities and securities of certain other
investment companies may be exempt from state and local taxation.

Capital Gain Distributions. The fund may distribute any net realized capital gains once a year or more often, as necessary.

Tax Status of the Fund. The fund intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code so that it will not be liable for federal tax on income and capital gains distributed to shareholders. In order to qualify as a regulated investment
company, and avoid being subject to federal income or excise taxes at the fund level, the fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized capital gains within each calendar year as well as on a fiscal year basis, and intends to comply with other tax rules applicable to
regulated investment companies.

Other Tax Information. The information above is only a summary of some of the tax consequences generally affecting the fund and its
shareholders, and no attempt has been made to discuss individual tax consequences. It is up to you or your tax preparer to determine whether the sale of
shares of the fund resulted in a capital gain or loss or other tax consequence to you. In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to
state and local taxes on fund distributions, and shares may be subject to state and local personal property taxes. Investors should consult their tax advisers
to determine whether a fund is suitable to their particular tax situation.

*****  Messrs. McDonough and Williams served on the Board of Trustees through December 31, 2000.

A  Information is for the calendar year ended December 31, 2000 for 247 funds in the complex. Compensation figures include cash, amounts
required to be deferred, and may include amounts deferred at the election of Trustees. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2000, the
Trustees accrued required deferred compensation from the funds as follows: Ralph F. Cox, $111,000; Phyllis Burke Davis, $111,000; Robert
M. Gates, $111,000; Donald J. Kirk, $111,000; Ned C. Lautenbach, $111,000; Marvin L. Mann, $111,000; William O. McCoy, $111,000;
Gerald C. McDonough, $141,000; and Thomas R. Williams, $111,000. Certain of the non-interested Trustees elected voluntarily to defer a
portion of their compensation as follows: Ralph F. Cox, $39,768; Ned C. Lautenbach, $46,296; William O. McCoy, $39,768; and Thomas R.
Williams, $46,296.

Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and amended in November 1996 and January 2000 (the Plan), non-interested
Trustees must defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of, their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the
Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a cross-section of Fidelity funds including funds in each major
investment discipline and representing a majority of Fidelity's assets under management (the Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately received by
the non-interested Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the investment performance of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in
accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's assets, liabilities, and net income per share, and will not obligate a fund to retain the
services of any non-interested Trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the non-interested Trustee. A fund may invest in the Reference
Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.

As of September 30, 2001, 100% of the fund's total outstanding shares was held by mutual funds managed by FMR or an FMR affiliate.

CONTROL OF INVESTMENT ADVISER

FMR Corp., organized in 1972, is the ultimate parent company of FIMM. The voting common stock of FMR Corp. is divided into two classes.
Class B is held predominantly by members of the Edward C. Johnson 3d family and is entitled to 49% of the vote on any matter acted upon by the
voting common stock. Class A is held predominantly by non-Johnson family member employees of FMR Corp. and its affiliates and is entitled to 51%
of the vote on any such matter. The Johnson family group and all other Class B shareholders have entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under
which all Class B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of Class B shares. Under the 1940 Act, control of a company is presumed
where one individual or group of individuals owns more than 25% of the voting stock of that company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting
common stock and the execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to form
a controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.

At present, the primary business activities of FMR Corp. and its subsidiaries are: (i) the provision of investment advisory, management,
shareholder, investment information and assistance and certain fiduciary services for individual and institutional investors; (ii) the provision of
securities brokerage services; (iii) the management and development of real estate; and (iv) the investment in and operation of a number of emerging
businesses.

The fund and FIMM have adopted a code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act that sets forth employees' fiduciary responsibilities regarding
the fund, establishes procedures for personal investing, and restricts certain transactions. Employees subject to the code of ethics, including Fidelity
investment personnel, may invest in securities for their own investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by the fund.

MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

The fund has entered into a management contract with FIMM, pursuant to which FIMM furnishes investment advisory and other services.

Management Services. Under the terms of its management contract with the fund, FIMM acts as investment adviser and, subject to the
supervision of the Board of Trustees, directs the investments of the fund in accordance with its investment objective, policies and limitations. FIMM
also provides the fund with all necessary office facilities and personnel for servicing the fund's investments, compensates all officers of the fund and
all Trustees who are "interested persons" of the trust or of FIMM, and all personnel of the fund or FIMM performing services relating to research,
statistical and investment activities.

In addition, FIMM or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services necessary
for the operation of the fund. These services include providing facilities for maintaining the fund's organization; supervising relations with custodians,
transfer and pricing agents, accountants, underwriters and other persons dealing with the fund; preparing all general shareholder communications and
conducting shareholder relations; maintaining the fund's records and, if necessary, the registration of the fund's shares under federal securities laws and
making necessary filings under state securities laws; developing management and shareholder services for the fund; and furnishing reports, evaluations
and analyses on a variety of subjects to the Trustees.

Management-Related Expenses. Under the terms of the fund's management contract, the fund pays all of its expenses other than those
specifically payable by FIMM. FIMM, either itself or through an affiliate, pays all fees associated with transfer agent and pricing and bookkeeping
services. Expenses payable by the fund include interest and taxes, brokerage commissions (if any), fees and expenses of the non-interested Trustees,
legal expenses, fees of the custodian and auditor, costs of registering shares under federal securities laws and making necessary filings under state
securities laws, expenses for typesetting, printing, and mailing proxy materials to shareholders and all other expenses of proxy solicitations and
shareholder meetings, the fund's proportionate share of insurance premiums, if any, and Investment Company Institute dues, and such non-recurring
expenses as may arise, including costs of any litigation to which the fund may be a party, and any obligation it may have to indemnify its officers and
Trustees with respect to litigation.

Management Fees. For the services of FIMM under the management contract, FMR, on behalf of the fund, pays FIMM a monthly management
fee. For each fund (other than a fund for which FIMM serves as sub-adviser) that invests in the fund in a given month, FMR pays FIMM a fee equal to
50% of the monthly management fee rate (including performance adjustments, if any) that FMR receives from the investing fund, multiplied by the
average net assets invested by that fund in the fund for the month. The fee is reduced to reflect any expenses paid by FMR on behalf of an investing
fund pursuant to an all-inclusive fee management contract, but is not reduced to reflect any fee waivers or expense reimbursements made by FMR.

FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of the fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes, brokerage
commissions, and extraordinary expenses), which is subject to revision or discontinuance. FMR retains the ability to be repaid for these expense
reimbursements in the amount that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal year.

Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase the fund's returns and yield, and repayment of the reimbursement by the fund will lower its returns
and yield.

TRANSFER AND SERVICE AGENT AGREEMENTS

The fund has entered into a transfer agent agreement with Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC), an affiliate of
FIMM. Under the terms of the agreement, FIIOC performs transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services for the fund.

FIIOC receives no fees for providing transfer agency services to the fund.

FIIOC pays out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing transfer agent services. In addition, FIIOC bears the expense of typesetting,
printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional information, and all other reports, notices, and statements to existing shareholders, with
the exception of proxy statements.

The fund has entered into a service agent agreement with Fidelity Service Company, Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FIMM. Under the terms of the
agreements, FSC calculates the NAV and dividends for the fund and maintains the fund's portfolio and general accounting records.

For providing pricing and bookkeeping services, FSC receives a monthly fee based on the fund's average daily net assets throughout the month.

FIMM, either itself or through an affiliate, bears the cost of pricing and bookkeeping services under the terms of its management contract with the
fund.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST

Trust Organization. Fidelity Money Market Central Fund is a fund of Fidelity Garrison Street Trust, an open-end management investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust on April 23, 1986. On April 20, 2000, Fidelity Garrison Street Trust changed its name from Fidelity
Advisor Series V to Fidelity Garrison Street Trust. Currently, there are two funds in the trust: Fidelity Money Market Central Fund and Fidelity
Ultra-Short Central Fund. The Trustees are permitted to create additional funds in the trust and to create additional classes of the fund.

The assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, subject to the
rights of creditors, are allocated to such fund, and constitute the underlying assets of such fund. The underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be
charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund. Any general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or
more of the funds.

Shareholder Liability. The trust is an entity commonly known as a "Massachusetts business trust." Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of
such a trust may, under certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust.

The Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses of the trust or
fund. The Declaration of Trust provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of
shares and requires that each agreement, obligation, or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the Trustees relating to the trust or to a fund
shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets. The Declaration of Trust
further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund.

The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of each fund's property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable
for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for
some other reason. The Declaration of Trust also provides that each fund shall, upon request, assume the defense of any claim made against any
shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of
shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which a fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations. FMR believes that, in view of the above,
the risk of personal liability to shareholders is remote.

Voting Rights. Each fund's capital consists of shares of beneficial interest. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset
value you own. The voting rights of shareholders can be changed only by a shareholder vote. Shares may be voted in the aggregate, by fund, and by
class.

The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. Shares are fully paid and nonassessable, except as set forth under the heading "Shareholder
Liability" above.

The trust or a fund or a class may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to, or merger with, another open-end management investment company,
series, or class thereof, or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets. Generally, the merger of the trust or a fund or a class with another operating
mutual fund or the sale of all or a portion of the assets of the trust or a fund or a class to another operating mutual fund requires approval by a vote of
shareholders of the trust or the fund or the class. The Trustees may, however, reorganize or terminate the trust or a fund or a class without prior
shareholder approval. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the trust, shareholders of each of its funds are entitled to receive the underlying
assets of such fund available for distribution. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of a fund or a class, shareholders of that fund or that class are
entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund or class available for distribution.

Custodian. The Chase Manhattan Bank, 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York, is custodian of the assets of the fund. The custodian is
responsible for the safekeeping of the fund's assets and the appointment of any subcustodian banks and clearing agencies. The Bank of New York,
headquartered in New York, also may serve as a special purpose custodian of certain assets in connection with repurchase agreement transactions.

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, Members of the Advisory Board, and Members of the Board of Trustees may, from time to
time, conduct transactions with various banks, including banks serving as custodians for certain funds advised by FMR. Transactions that have
occurred to date include mortgages and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of FMR, the terms and conditions of those transactions
were not influenced by existing or potential custodial or other fund relationships.

Auditor. Deloitte & Touche LLP, 200 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts, serves as independent accountant for the fund. The auditor
examines financial statements for the fund and provides other audit, tax, and related services.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Item 24.  Trusts Controlled by or under Common Control with this Trust

  The Board of Trustees of the Trust is the same as the board of other Fidelity funds, each of which has Fidelity
Management & Research Company, or an affiliate, as its investment adviser. In addition, the officers of the Trust are substantially
identical to those of the other Fidelity funds.  Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it is not under common control with
other Fidelity funds because the power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as the result of an official position with
the respective trusts.

Item 25.  Indemnification

  Article XI, Section 2 of the Declaration of Trust sets forth the reasonable and fair means for determining whether
indemnification shall be provided to any past or present Trustee or officer. It states that the Trust shall indemnify any present
or past trustee or officer to the fullest extent permitted by law against liability, and all expenses reasonably incurred by him or
her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which he or she is involved by virtue of his or her service as a
trustee or officer and against any amount incurred in settlement thereof. Indemnification will not be provided to a person
adjudged by a court or other adjudicatory body to be liable to the Trust or its shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance,
bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or her duties (collectively, "disabling conduct"), or not to have acted in
good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interest of the Trust. In the event of a settlement, no
indemnification may be provided unless there has been a determination, as specified in the Declaration of Trust, that the
officer or trustee did not engage in disabling conduct.



  Pursuant to the agreement by which Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. ("FIIOC") is
appointed transfer agent, the Registrant agrees to indemnify and hold FIIOC harmless against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) resulting from:

  (1)  any claim, demand, action or suit brought by any person other than the Registrant, including by a
shareholder, which names FIIOC and/or the Registrant as a party and is not based on and does not result from FIIOC's willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of duties, and arises out of or in connection with FIIOC's
performance under the Transfer Agency Agreement; or

  (2)  any claim, demand, action or suit (except to the extent contributed to by FIIOC's willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence or reckless disregard of duties) which results from the negligence of the Registrant, or from FIIOC's acting
upon any instruction(s) reasonably believed by it to have been executed or communicated by any person duly authorized by
the Registrant, or as a result of FIIOC's acting in reliance upon advice reasonably believed by FIIOC to have been given by
counsel for the Registrant, or as a result of FIIOC's acting in reliance upon any instrument or stock certificate reasonably
believed by it to have been genuine and signed, countersigned or executed by the proper person.
