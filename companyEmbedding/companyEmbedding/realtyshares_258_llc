About RealtyShares
Founded by Nav Athwal, RealtyShares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in pre-screened and professionally managed residential, commercial, retail, and mixed-use projects. Not only does RealtyShares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments, but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments.
How Does RealtyShares Claim To Work?
By now, you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, GoFundMe, and Booster.com, which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs. Using these websites, all you have to do is list your project, and if other people are interested in helping you out, they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with.
Recently though, a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like RealtyShares, which claims to serve two primary purposes: 1) to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects, and 2) help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders.
Since coming online in late 2013, RealtyShares has garnered quite a lot of media attention, having been featured on the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, CNN Money, Business Times, and more, due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms, and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently.
In short, RealtyShares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects. And according to the company, they give you the ability to make real estate investments in 5 simple steps:

Sign up for a RealtyShares account.
Browse investments securely. If you find one you’re interested in, you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering, including “financials, property information, legal and financial documents and investment manager bios.”
Finalize your investment directly through the RealtyShares website. The company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using DocuSign and funds can be transferred via Balanced.
Next, each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share. While you’re waiting for this to occur, your money will be held in an FDIC insured escrow account. And if this goal isn’t reached, then 100% of your money will be refunded.
All RealtyShares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents. You’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email, and tax documents are provided once per year.

You’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions, and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest, but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time, or are just a passing fad. After all, you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hard-earned money.
But is RealtyShares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions? Consider the following:
You Have Options When it Comes to Real Estate Investing
First and foremost, if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website, keep in mind that RealtyShares isn’t your only option, as other sites such as Fundrise, Realty Mogul, CrowdStreet, Collaperty, and many more are vying for your business.
With this said, according to RealtyShares’ CEO, the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees, complete transparency, a seamless investment process, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities.
How Much Risk Are You Willing to Take On?
Next, like any other type of investment, real estate projects come with a certain level of risk, so you’re not guaranteed to make any money. In fact, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up losing your entire investment.
Also, remember that real estate investments are not liquid, which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time. As such, you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it.
RealtyShares’ Investor Guidelines
If you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on RealtyShares, the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an Accredited Investor. According to the RealtyShares FAQ, this means you must be “a natural person with (1) a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding $1 million, not including the value of the primary residence, and / or (2) annual income of $200,000 in each of the two most recent years, or joint income with a spouse exceeding $300,000 for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year.”
On top of this, you must have a minimum of $5,000 to contribute to a project, although some investments may go as low as $1,000. There is no maximum investment amount, and you can even qualify as a foreign investor.
RealtyShares’ Investment Options
If you qualify as an investor, you’ll have two options: Debt investment and equity investment.
Debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project, and depending on your level of investment, your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account. On the other hand, an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis, or on the profits if the project is sold.
Regardless of the type, each investment will come with its own ‘hold period,” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold. This information will be available on the project’s Investment Overview page, and can last anywhere from less than 6 months to more than 5 years.
RealtyShares’ Company Guidelines
According to the company’s website, RealtyShares only provides loans (e.g. debt investments) for 1-4 unit residential properties, and some commercial properties, such as apartment buildings. Specifically, the website’s FAQ states projects must be:

Cash-flowing/Value-Add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes;
Equity investments in Fix & Flips located in high demand/low supply markets;
Loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.

On top of this, borrowers must have a minimum 650 credit score, a loan to purchase price of less than 80%, and an “estimated loan to after repair value (once the property is rehabbed) less than 65%.” As such, the RealtyShares will not work for construction or ground-up development projects.
On top of this, RealtyShares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed, including background and credit checks, comps, projected returns, geography, property type and quality, investment structure, a knowledgeable team, and a proven track record.
Although RealtyShares doesn’t guarantee successful funding, the company claims that most projects listed are funded within 5-7 days. However, for any projects listed on RealtyShares, companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with Regulation D Rule 506(b).
Finally, RealtyShares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors, since all funds are pooled into a single LLC.
The Difference Between RealtyShares & REITs
When compared to REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), RealtyShares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in, whereas REITs traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography. In addition, RealtyShares claims to charge substantially lower fees than REITs (we’ll talk more about this in a moment).
What Are Other Investors Saying About RealtyShares?
RealtyShares, Inc. has only been in business since late 2013, and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research.
However, most professional reviews from large websites such as Forbes and TechCrunch seem to be favorable, not just for RealtyShares, but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general.
RealtyShares Pricing
RealtyShares is free to sign up for an account, whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding. However, according to the company’s FAQ, they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment,” although the specific fee for each investment can vary, and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement.
After a project has been funded, the money is pooled and moved into an individual LLC, which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment. As such, you will be a shareholder in this LLC.
Compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites, RealtyShares accepts Bitcoin for investments, either through Coinbase or your Bitcoin Address, although distributions will be paid in US Dollars.
In order to ask questions about fees, payments, or anything else, you can contact RealtyShares’ customer service department at 866-202-2023.
Can RealtyShares Help You Wisely Diversify Your Investment Portfolio?
Chopping to the Point: Considering the fact that RealtyShares has received a fair amount of positive media attention, that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase, and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company, they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects.

Very positive experience. I've always wanted to invest in real estate, but there haven't been many great options. I was able to invest in 10 different investments (with as little as $5,000) and get exposure to diverse markets and product types.
The user experience is simple, and everything is streamlined.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

I invested two years ago in few offerings and so far, everything is in deep red. "Triwest" who sponsored 12954 Blairwood Dr & 12090 Chalon Rd. investment and Paragon who sponsored 1651 Gilbert Road, have stopped making payments. They have given lame excuses for delays. 
They are running a Ponzi scheme to dupe investors and RealtyShares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors. Don't get caught in this poor dealings.


Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend

TriWest certainly has been a disaster. Fortunately, they managed to sell the property I had investments in and made some money, but nothing like their claimed return. Even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate.
I agree that RealtyShares does minimal due diligence. What is shocking is you can't get access to the agreement with the sponsor, only the RealtyShares LLC., you are investing in, so the real terms and conditions aren't available.
They are also easy to dupe, they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered. RealtyShares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities.
A strong buyer beware. Not only does RealityShares do little to no due diligence, but they make it impossible for you to do so either. Go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at RealityShares and they won't answer.
I went back to making my own hard money loans so I have access to the property, the borrower and can track things closely.

It seems natural to approach with caution, since most people don't have much experience with this specific concept. My experience has been very positive. RealtyShares has been very professional and responsible. Any real estate project has risks by default, but I have had no issues after making more than 35 investments using the RealtyShares platform. RealtyShares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors; because of that, projects that might include underfunded developers, crackpots, slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform. The return/risk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered. I would - and have - recommended RealtyShares to good friends.


Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend this to a friend

RealtySharesSign Up for RealtySharesBack to PlatformsSimilar Real Estate Crowdfunding PlatformsAcquireRealCrowdiFundingRealtyShares ReviewAverage Rating:  2 reviewsSummaryRealtyShares has some strong points including adequate capital, support from savvy backers, a user-friendly website and some good press. Investors also like its low minimums ($1,000 for your first deal, generally $5,000 thereafter) and hold periods as short as six months. It is also trying some innovative things such as accepting Bitcoin and providing market-specific products aimed at its core investor base among IT professionals in five cities.
But the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips, a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators. The site does have some funds and multi-family/commercial projects, but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the RE crowdfunding universe.
Investors who like the deals it offers will find RealtyShares a likeable and easy to navigate platform. But it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved.
BACKGROUND
Founded in Q2 2013 by CEO Nav Athwal, RealtyShares has received $11.9 million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including $10 million in a Series A funding in April 2015. Its backers include well known venture capitalists Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst Partners and 500 Startups.
Menlo Ventures’ Managing Director John Jarve, who sits on the board of hot automated investing service Betterment, is on the RealtyShares board.
RealtyShares has been compared to a Lending Club for real estate, offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects. It funds about 10 to 20 projects a month.
The inspiration for Athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development. Those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on RealtyShares. After the financial crisis of 2007, traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access.

PROS

Low minimum of $1,000 for first investment (otherwise usually $5,000), focus on deals with short lifecycles



CONS

Deal quality is not high, weighted to single family home flip market, only for accredited investors, high fees



BOTTOM LINE
RealtyShares is a smaller player in the real-estate crowdfunding arena. It has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments. But its deal flow includes many single family home flips, which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms. Its fees are considered higher than average too.
PHILOSOPHY
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal says that RealtyShares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served, especially small real estate developers and house flippers. The process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the 2007 economic crisis. They often will not lend to individuals without W2 income.
Crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns. In one case covered by CNBC, Chicago house flipper Ben Walhood said he can get full funding from RealtyShares in as little as an hour. Investors in his deals would earn around 11% vs loans around 4% if backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in traditional financing.
RealtyShares is “able to provide quicker, more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards. Banks just aren’t meeting that need,” Athwal said.
TYPICAL PROJECTS AND GEOGRAPHY
At the time of our test, there were five live deals on the site including a fund, two single family flips and two apartment buildings. Three were in California and the others in New York and Florida. RealtyShares has done transactions in 18 states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from Florida, California, Illinois and Texas.
The deals we saw ranged in size from $160,000 to $1.6 million for the RealtyShares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions. Minimum investment ranged from $2,000 to $25,000 and hold terms from eight months to five years.
RealtyShares says it welcomes cash-flowing/value add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments, retail, office and pools of single family homes; equity investment in fix and flips in high demand/low supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate.
TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC
RealtyShares is only open to accredited investors, meaning those with net worth of $1 million or income of $200,000 a year. The platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the $2 million to $30 million range and all types of cash-flowing residential and commercial projects.
RealtyShares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years.
Many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model. RealtyShares said in 2014 that 10 to 15% of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate.
INTEREST IN INNOVATION
Athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities. Unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms, the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities. It is creating market-specific products to enable developers in Seattle, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Chicago to raise funding from local investors.
RealtyShares’ interest in innovation led it in 2014 to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment. The platform says this is a more cost-effective and streamlined way for investors to send money, especially if they are abroad, because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers.
WEBSITE POPULARITY
As of June 2015, RealtyShares has an estimated 90,000 monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about 4 minute on the site with 4.04 page views.  About 92% of the traffic is from the United States. As of mid-May 2015, RealtyShares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the United States.
LEADERSHIP TEAM
RealtyShares’ founder Athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer. He worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing California and national developers and REITs in the San Francisco Bay area. He doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid.
The management team is rounded out by eight specialists with hands-on experience in operations, transactions, engineering and other disciplines. Again, they have strong resumes but not high name recognition. RealtyShares’ leadership earned a B grade in one review.
WHAT DO THE EXPERTS THINK?
RealtyShares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as 500 Startups, so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform. But it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites, and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin.
Blogger Mark Robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on RealtyShares. While he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays, he said they have met or beat expectations.
SUMMARY
RealtyShares looks like a solid platform with long-term potential. While its low minimum investments are attractive, it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees. It is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals, especially fix and flip single family home projects. It’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or second-position loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of 8-12% annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period and/or a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property.
HOW DOES REALTYSHARES SCREEN INVESTMENTS?
RealtyShares reviews the sponsors first, looking for companies with experience. It says it runs background and credit checks. Then it reviews proposed transactions including financials, geography, property type and quality, and investment structure.
“While each investment includes risk and RealtyShares cannot guarantee results, our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform,” it says. “Once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform, investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity, and if so, how much.”
So, like other crowdfunded real estate sites, it’s up to you to do your due diligence.
UNDERWRITING/DEAL FLOW
CEO Athwal said that as of spring 2015 RealtyShares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about 1 in 10 properties that are offered to it.  “I think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property,” he said.
However, the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips. These are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators, and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lower-quality deals than bigger budget projects.
FEES
RealtyShares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications. But the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement. The ones we viewed were 40-plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher.
As best we could tell, the ongoing fees to RealtyShares as manager of the transaction LLC amounted to 1% a year. RealtyShares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals.
This article says RealtyShares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of 2 percent to 3 percent. It also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment (including providing investors with tax documents and distributions) through the platform. A RealtyShares presentation for a funding round in February 2014 showed it earning fees of 3-5%.
That is comparatively high among RE crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment.
EASE OF USE
RealtyShares has a more involved sign-up process than other platforms we have test driven. While some sites initially ask only for an email address and password, RealtyShares seeks your phone number, address, employer, amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you.
If you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment, that might make you leery. But it also suggests RealtyShares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests, so it could be a plus for some. It offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with 11-14% return, 6-9 month hold, unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals.
After signing up, you see a countdown clock on the 30-day cooling off period. You are also directed to a helpful eight-minute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it. We liked this feature a lot.
LISTINGS
The page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow. There’s a deal dashboard, and tabs allow you to view an overview, financials, documents, photos, background on management and FAQs. One closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project, which provided a wealth of information.
WHAT AM I BUYING ON REALTYSHARES?
RealtyShares explains what you are actually buying this way: RealtyShares sets up a separate Limited Liability Company (LLC), for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform.  That LLC in turn will make a loan on a real estate property (in the case of a debt investment) or hold equity in an LLC or LP that in turn owns real estate property (in the case of an equity investment).  When you invest through RealtyShares, you own shares in that LLC.  Using this structure, you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level.
If you invest in a debt deal, the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments.  A share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.  If you invest in an equity investment opportunity (usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties), the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents and/or a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold. As with debt investments, a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account.
HOW SAFE IS MY MONEY?
As we’ve said before, real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices, and that holds even truer for RealtyShares. Experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals. Real estate by its nature can be a risky investment, and RealtyShares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals.
While offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum, RealtyShares could do a much better job of making its site transparent. It says it is currently affiliated with WealthForge, a registered broker-dealer with FINRA and member of SIPC (both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors), and that WealthForge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyShares.
But it’s unclear if SIPC protections apply to RealtyShares investments. Even if they do, they do not protect against loss in value, liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors. They would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer.
In truth, it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter, and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate.

There are various pluses and minuses with the service, but RealtyShares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors. Crowdfunding generally democratizes investing, making it available to even the smallest investors. The accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals. We’ll give RealtyShares a rating of 4.0 out of 5.0 stars, with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative.


Crowdfunding Website Reviews

We have singled out RealtyShares for the purpose of our first Real Estate Crowdfunding Site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye. Not the least of which is their forward-thinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using BitCoin. We love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments. This move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing, the Tech Crowd.

Terms of Service
Last Updated June 27, 2016
Introduction
Thank you for visiting the RealtyShares website, owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. ("RealtyShares" or the "Company"). Please read these Terms of Service (this "Agreement" or the "Terms") carefully before using the services offered by RealtyShares. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website at www.realtyshares.com, all other sites owned and operated by RealtyShares that redirect to www.realtyshares.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”). By accessing, browsing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Site or contributing content, information, or other materials or services to the Site, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, RealtyShares' Privacy Policy, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published by RealtyShares from time to time on the Site (collectively, the “Published Information”), each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by RealtyShares from time to time without notice to you. In order to access the Site and the Service, you must accept these Terms, the Privacy Policy and any Published Information.

Your use of the Site and Service is governed by the then current version of the Agreement in effect on the date of such use. RealtyShares may, at its sole discretion, modify and replace the Agreement at any time and without prior notice to you by posting the updated Agreement on the Site. By using and accessing the Service, you acknowledge and agree to review the then current version of the Agreement prior to each such use. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications to the Terms have been published on the Service or otherwise provided to you constitutes your acknowledgement of, and binding agreement to, the then current Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and RealtyShares will be governed by the Terms in effect at the time the events giving rise to such dispute occurred. RealtyShares further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site at any time and for any reason. You agree that RealtyShares and its subsidiaries and affiliates will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance.

Please also note that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are in addition to any other agreements between you and RealtyShares, including any customer, account or marketing agreements, and any other agreements that govern your use of products, services, content, tools, and information available on the Site. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with RealtyShares, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, for the Service or otherwise. If you do not agree to all the terms of this Agreement, RealtyShares’ Privacy Policy and/or any Published Information, you are not eligible to participate in RealtyShares’ Service or otherwise use this Site. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site or Service, including investment managers ("Managers"), investors, including Accredited Investors, as defined by SEC Regulation D Rule 501 (collectively, "Investors"), and visitors to the Site, who in any way use the Site or Service provided by RealtyShares (in each case, a "User"). Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be deemed to confer rights on Users or third parties.

Authorized User
The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old (and at least the legal age in your jurisdiction). You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are at least 18 years old and of legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. RealtyShares may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity. The Service is not available to any Users suspended or removed from the Site or Service by RealtyShares. By using the Service, you represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Site or Service.

Some of our services, and certain web pages of the Site, are available only to those Users who have been authorized by us to access those services and web pages. Only Users of the Service who are Accredited Investors as defined in Regulation D Rule 501 adopted pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (“Accredited Investors”) with a valid User ID and password are authorized to access such services and web pages. In general, to qualify as an Accredited Investor, individuals must have a net worth of more than $1 million (excluding their primary residence), or gross income for each of the last two years of at least $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with their spouse) with the expectation of a similarly qualifying income during the current year. The authorization for such Accredited Investors may require completion of an Accredited Investor questionnaire and satisfactory background information screening and/or identification verification. By registering for, accessing, browsing, and/or otherwise using the services and/or web pages for which access is restricted to Accredited Investors, you represent and agree that you are an Accredited Investor. Should you cease to be an Accredited Investor at any time, you agree to immediately notify RealtyShares and to refrain from accessing such restricted portions of the Site and/or Service. Further, because access to the restricted portions of the Site is limited by applicable law to Accredited Investors, you agree that you will not allow anyone to access such restricted portions of the Site, or share or disclose any information obtained through restricted portions of the Site with anyone, regardless of whether you believe such person or entity to also be an Accredited Investor.

As part of RealtyShares’ authorization process, each user shall be required to provide, among other things, a valid email address. In providing your email address and agreeing to these Terms of Service, each authorized user consents to receiving email notifications from RealtyShares concerning offerings. In some cases, users of the restricted portions of the Site may be required to confirm their status as an Accredited Investor. In order for RealtyShares to confirm that your representation regarding your status as an Accredited Investor is accurate when made and continues to be accurate from time to time, you agree to provide RealtyShares with all information and documentation reasonably required by RealtyShares to verify your status as an Accredited Investor, including (without limitation) delivering a completed Accredited Investor questionnaire, tax returns, brokerage statements, bank statements, resumes and other private financial information. Should you fail to provide any requested information and documentation that confirms your status as an Accredited Investor, RealtyShares may immediately suspend, block or otherwise discontinue your access and use of the Site or Service. RealtyShares may change its eligibility criteria at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice.

Persons who are resident outside of the United States are allowed access to such investment opportunities only if such access does not violate the laws of their country of residence. Our services (and certain pages of the Site) that relate to the viewing of actual investment opportunities or to making investments in the securities offered therein may not be used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction where the provision or use thereof would be contrary to applicable laws, rules or regulations of any governmental authority or where RealtyShares or North Capital is not authorized to provide such information or services.

Securities Offerings; No Professional Advice Provided
The Service and securities offerings on this Site are available only to Accredited Investors who understand economic and investment risk and are willing to bear the consequences of that risk. Additionally, the securities offerings on this Site are only suitable for Accredited Investors who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with private real estate investments. By using the Site or Service, you represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. You acknowledge and agree that you have significant experience investing in investments of the type offered through the Site, including, without limitation, real estate, equities, notes and other securities, you understand that all of the investments offered through the Service are inherently very risky, and you understand the risks associated with the investments offered through the Site, and you are comfortable with the risk of losing your entire investment invested through the Service. You further acknowledge and agree that investing in private placements carries with it low liquidity concerns and long-term commitments and that the securities sold through private placements are not publicly traded. Additionally, Investors may receive restricted stock that may be subject to holding period requirements. For those reasons, these offerings may be made availabile only to certain institutional investors and high net worth individuals and entities. If you are using the Site on behalf of any entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on such entity’s behalf, and that such entity agrees to indemnify RealtyShares for violations of this Agreement.
You further represent and agree that you understand that RealtyShares does not guarantee the performance of any offerings made through the Site or Service and any and all projections, estimates, and expectations for investments offered through the Site or Service are merely opinions and should not be relied on for any purpose whatsoever. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. The contents of this Site do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Investors are solely responsible for conducting any legal, accounting or due diligence review. You acknowledge and agree that RealtyShares is not a registered Investment Company or Investment Advisor within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, respectively. You should obtain investment and tax advice from your advisers before deciding to invest. Investment products are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and there is no bank guarantee.
The securities offered on the Site have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D and Rule 506, and/or Regulation S, promulgated thereunder. Securities sold through private placements are restricted and not publicly traded, and are therefore illiquid. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved, passed upon or endorsed the merits of any offering on this Website.
RealtyShares is not a registered broker-dealer, funding portal, or investment advisor and does not conduct any activity that would require such registration. Equity securities are offered through North Capital Private Securities Corporation(“North Capital”), member FINRA/SIPC. Individual personnel of RealtyShares may become registered representatives of North Capital. North Capital has developed a business continuity plan on how they will respond to events that significantly disrupt business. North Capital is located at 2825 E. Cottonwood Pkwy, Suite 500, Salt Lake City, UT 84121, tel: (888) 841-9984.

Investment overviews on the Site contain summaries of the purpose and principal business terms of the investment opportunities. Such summaries are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to be complete, and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed discussions contained in the investor document package relating to such investment opportunity. The information contained in the Website has been prepared by RealtyShares without reference to any particular user's investment requirements or financial situation, and potential investors are encouraged to consult with professional tax, legal and financial advisors before making any investment.


You may not become a beneficial owner of 20% or more of any issuer's outstanding voting equity securities (an “Issuer Covered Person”) without becoming subject to certain “bad actor” disqualifying events described in Rule 506(d) (a “Disqualifying Event”). You represent that you are not subject to a Disqualifying Event and that you will promptly notify RealtyShares in writing should any Disqualifying Events be applicable to you. RealtyShares is not liable or responsible for making Rule 506(e) disclosures, nor for determining whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a Disqualifying Event.

RealtyShares can become your company’s capital-raising partner. Please contact us at raise@realtyshares.com to discuss your particular project.
What kind of real estate investments can be listed on RealtyShares?
RealtyShares lists investment opportunities involving a variety of real estate property types, including
        multi-family residential, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, and hospitality facilities.
        Single-family residences being used for investment purposes (not owner-occupied) are also the subject of
        many investment opportunities. We generally prefer to finance properties in or near a significant
        metropolitan area, but it all depends on the particular situation.
RealtyShares also offers several different types of financing options. We can do secured real estate
        loans (both first- or second-lien positions); equity financing, usually for properties involving in-place
        cash flow that provide an income component to the investment; and/or “preferred equity” investments
        involving a preferential position in the equity capital structure but with only limited potential upside
        (so that sponsors retain most of the appreciation). If there is a specific property or financing type you
        might be interested in, let us know
        here.
What criteria does RealtyShares have for debt financing?
RealtyShares, through its lending subsidiary RS Lending, Inc., provides business-purposes loans (i.e., no
        owner-occupied properties) secured by both conventional residential properties (such as single-family
        residences) as well as commercial properties (e.g., larger apartment buildings, retail centers, office
        buildings, etc.). We can provide both short-term (usually, 36 months or less) 1st-lien and 2nd-lien debt
        financing on residential properties. We can also provide both bridge or permanent debt financing on
        commercial properties.
RealtyShares looks at a number of criteria in underwriting potential loan opportunities. Generally, we
        look for certain minimum loan-to-cost (LTC) or loan-to-after-repair-value (ARV) criteria. We also like to
        understand the operating plan for the project, and we verify borrower credit and background history.
Each of these criteria vary slightly by situation and loan product; please contact us here to discuss your particular project.
How do you keep my personal information secure?
We go to great lengths to ensure the security of all of our members and our data and use Secure Sockets
        Layer. SSL is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and
        a browser. We use 128-bit encryption, which is the same level of encryption used by top national banks. We
        are also regularly audited by third party security firms to ensure compliance with the most rigorous
        security standards.
For added protection, we never store your banking information on our servers and we automatically log you
        out of your account after 30 minutes of inactivity.
How do you choose which real estate companies can raise money through RealtyShares?
We’re looking for companies with a knowledgeable team and a proven strategy and track record. Among other
        diligence inquiries, we will run background and credit checks on the principals of your company, and will
        perform a more thorough review of each project that is initially thought to be a suitable fit for our
        platform. Once we are comfortable with your team and the investment, we can proceed to the details of
        getting your project listed on our platform.
Currently, we list only a relatively small percentage of all of the prospective projects that are
        brought to us.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
