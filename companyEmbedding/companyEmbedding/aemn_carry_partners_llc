 About Us
 Welcome World Wellness
 What is wellness? We ask ourselves this question multiple times a day. Why? Because we believe that focusing our attention shapes our world. So we focus on wellness. We anticipate its arrival. And we welcome its physical, mental and emotional manifestations in our business and in our lives.
At Natural Partners, wellness is an evolving process of achieving an increasingly full, healthy life. In fact, walk through our doors and you’ll see enhancing different forms of wellness is behind everything we do:

 Providing professional products backed by solid science
 Lending a listening ear
 Expediting, tracking and following up on everything order related
 Advancing and automating technology to simplify patient care
 Bringing together a community of key medical influencers
 Helping each other achieve healthy outcomes
 Supporting a more personalized approach to wellness
 Educating patients on ingredients, products and health benefits
 Breaking into song for no reason whatsoever

If it advances world wellness, we welcome it.
 We'll help with that
 Our company first came into being as a resource for integrated healthcare practitioners who were so busy caring for their patients, they had no time left in the day for the logistics of ordering products and managing inventory. If they had to choose between caring for a patient and providing products, they chose the patient. Yet they understood that welcoming wellness often requires the support of general and condition-specific supplements. That's when our founder, Tye Smith, offered: “Let us handle that. You focus on your patients and your practice.” And Natural Partners was born.
How we help
 Natural Partners is a resource for practitioners who strive to improve patient wellness by providing education and professional-grade products. Since 1995, we’ve researched brands with trusted product lines and welcomed them into our family of wellness. Why? So we can offer practitioners the quality products they need—in a way that they love—to help them provide personalized care for their patients.
 And while you may have heard how seriously good we are at having fun, we’re equally as good at handling logistics and operational processes. We currently provide over 14,000 premium products from over 170 trusted brands. We work with hundreds of healthcare practitioners every week to help them set up and maintain an efficient, seamless ordering system that ensures their patients get the supplements they need when they need them.
 We know caring for patients takes a tribe. And we think that sharing the caring makes it joyful. That together we can make an even bigger difference in people’s health.
 Core Values

Treat others as you would like to be treated
Work with a sense of integrity at all times
Get the job done with teamwork and cooperation
Win others over and provide excellence in client services
Constantly grow and learn
Be innovative
Create a positive company atmosphere
Be bigger than our business
Find a way to create a healthy environment
Embrace positive change



NSF Certification
 

 Maintaining the quality of products and services is at the core of Natural Partners. As a distributor of professional-grade supplements we demonstrate our commitment to public safety by adhering to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as described by NSF.
 We are pleased to announce that our Lancaster, PA distribution center has been registered in compliance with GMP as set forth in NSF/ANSI Standard 173-2013, Dietary Supplements, Section 8. We are in the process of registering our Scottsdale, AZ distribution center.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Record-Breaking CO2 Well Stimulation Yields Outstanding Results  







Middle Montney well achieves top-tier 1,768 Boe/d production test results with largest CO2 stimulation. 
CALGARY, AB February 4, 2016 – Ferus Inc. (Ferus), the leading provider of off-road cryogenic fluids for the energy industry, is proud to be a major service provider for Blackbird Energy Inc. (TSX VENTURE:BBI), the emerging Canadian Exploration and Production company that recently completed and achieved exceptional top-tier production test results on a well located in the Middle Montney formation. The well completion method, which contributed to the outstanding results, was an energized CO2 foam frac using record-breaking volumes of CO2.
Ferus was the sole provider of CO2 and the associated logistics for the complex job. The integrated effort included Ferus demand planning staff and field supervisors managing on-site operations to safely pump the product and effectively implement the completion.
Production
          The CO2-based completion produced 1,768 Boe/d, exceeding Blackbird’s gas rate and total Boe/d type curve by 109% and 80% respectively. The Middle Montney well at Elmworth 2-20-70-7W6 was completed using sliding sleeve frac technology and an energized CO2 foam fracture with 70 individual stages. A total of 10,531 m3 (88,317 Bbls) of load fluid and 9,226 m3 of CO2 distributed an average of 31.75 tonnes of proppant per stage over the 70 stages.
“Only through working with Ferus were we able to implement this type of completion for our 2-20 well,” stated CEO of Blackbird Energy Inc., Garth Braun in his Executive Letter, January 2016. “One reason we chose to use CO2 was its superior viscosity and therefore its ability to place sand more effectively. In addition, CO2 has also been proven to carry proppant deeper into a reservoir, which leads potentially to lower decline rates, higher recovery rates and better productivity overall. Furthermore, the switch to CO2 allowed us to demonstrate deliverability of the Middle Montney at an earlier stage than a slickwater frac would allow under a testing scenario.”
Based upon long-term forecasting of reserves recovery between slickwater and CO2 foams (SPE 168632), Ferus estimates the incremental reserves of the well are approximately 25 to 30 per cent higher than an equivalent slickwater well.
Water Savings 
          Fracturing with CO2 foam fluid also provides environmental benefits by significantly reducing the water volume needed to complete the fracturing treatment.
“We believe the estimated equivalent of slickwater usage, had the well been completed that way instead of with CO2, would have been 30,000 m3,” said Murray Reynolds, Director of Technical Services at Ferus. “By fracturing the well with CO2, not only did Blackbird achieve significantly higher production, it also reduced water usage by approximately two thirds, which represents responsible resource stewardship. Furthermore, the use of CO2 meant fewer pumpers required onsite and reduced land footprint due to less water storage needs.”        
Additional Benefits of CO2 Well Stimulations:

Reduced Truck Traffic – Incremental total truck traffic reduction, at an estimated 21,500 m3 per truck, equates to 322 less trucks on the lease and on the highway.


Reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

Less truck traffic reduces GHG emissions and community impacts.
Ferus sources its Canadian CO2 from industrial waste stacks which would otherwise be emitted, and turns pollution into a commercial product.
Wells stimulated with energized fluids also require less horsepower to perform the hydraulic fracturing treatment; another source of decreased GHG emissions.



“Ferus is proud to be a partner on the well completions with an innovative company like Blackbird Energy,” said Tyler Dahlseide, VP Energized Fluids at Ferus. “The production test results of the 2-20 well demonstrate to the energy sector that CO2 is an effective fracture fluid alternative that achieves both economic and environmental objectives.”

Carried Interest

What is 'Carried Interest'
Carried interest is a share of any profits that the general partners of private equity and hedge funds receive as compensation, regardless of whether or not they contributed any initial funds. This method of compensation seeks to motivate the general partner (fund manager) to work toward improving the fund's performance.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Carried Interest'
      Traditionally, the amount of carried interest comes out to around 20 to 25% of the fund's annual profit. While all funds tend to charge a small management fee, it is meant to only cover the costs of managing the fund with the exception of compensating the fund manager. Carried interest serves as the primary source of income for the general partner. However, the general partner must ensure that all the initial capital that the limited partners contribute is returned along with some previously agreed upon rate of return.How Carried Interest WorksThe general partner is compensated through an annual management fee, which typically amounts to 2% of the fund’s assets. The larger portion of compensation is generated through the general partner's share of the fund's profit, which is called carried interest. The carried interest portion, which typically amounts to 20% of the net profits, is vested over a number of years and received as earned after that point. The private equity industry has always maintained that this is a fair compensation arrangement because the general partner invests a tremendous amount of time and resources towards building the companies in their portfolio to profitability. Much of the general partner's time is spent in developing strategy, working to improve management performance and company efficiencies, and maximizing the value of a company in preparation for its sale or initial public offering (IPO).Profit or Salary?Carry is not automatic; it is only created when the fund generates profits that exceed a specified return level known as the hurdle rate. If the hurdle rate of return is not achieved, the general partner does not receive carry, although the limited partners continue to receive their proportionate share. Carry can also be clawed-back if the fund underperforms over time. For example, if the limited partners are expecting a 10% annual return, and the fund only returns 7% over a period of time, a portion of the carry paid to the general partner could be returned to cover the deficiency. The clawback provision, when added to the other risks the general partner undertakes, leads private equity industry advocates to their justification that carried interest is not a salary; instead, it is an at-risk return on investment that is only payable based on performance achievement.Carried interest is classified under the tax code as capital gains, which are taxed at the more favorable capital gains tax rate. Critics of carried interest want it to be reclassified as ordinary income to be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. Private equity advocates that the increased tax will subdue the incentive to take the kind of risk that is necessary to invest in and manage companies to profitability.

How Limited is Limited Liability?
One of the key advantages of a limited liability company (LLC) over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners (members) of the LLC are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business.  Normally, that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier, lender, landlord or other creditor, that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the LLC.  The members may lose their entire investment in the business, but their other assets - car, home, and personal bank accounts - are safe from the creditors of the business.
Or are they?  In truth, there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability. Many LLC members will find that, due to the way the business was operated, the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful.
How Personal Liability Arises
A member of an LLC can be held personally liable for many different types of claims, but they typically arise under four different scenarios:

Claims arising out of an act or omission by the member, such as the member's own negligence, fraud or illegal act
Claims arising out of a contract, particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member
Claims based on the concept of "piercing the veil" of the LLC
Liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the LLC's operating agreement or the applicable LLC statute

These claims are not a result of choosing an LLC as a form of entity.  All of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and, in fact, the exceptions were developed first under corporate law.
Actions of a Member
Every member who actively participates in the business of the LLC runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability.  This is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service.  If you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone, your LLC is not going to protect you.  
Similarly, if you make promises about your product or service that are not true, the first claim may be against the LLC for breach of contract, but if the LLC cannot perform or pay damages, the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action.
Even if you have an employee who committed the action, you may not be out of the woods.  If you personally hired the employee, the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee.
A special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an LLC is failure to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.  To protect these so-called "trust fund taxes," any person who had the ability to prevent the non-payment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes.  The IRS applies this provision broadly, so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didn't, you are probably liable.
Claims Based on Contract
Another, and probably more common, source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability, usually by means of a personal guarantee.  For many small businesses, particularly new businesses with no credit history, obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible.  Landlords, too, often insist on a personal guarantee, particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as build-outs that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease.
Suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit, especially after the business is up and running.  Getting payment terms out of the gate, however, often requires a personal guarantee.
Even when the creditor isn't seeking a personal guarantee, a member of the LLC can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role. If she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the LLC, it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract. Every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the LLC (full name!) and should indicate the role of the person who is signing (member or manager).
Piercing the Veil of the LLC
Even if a member avoids personal guarantees, he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as "piercing the corporate veil." Although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice.
In almost all cases of piercing the veil, there is either commingling or diversion of assets.  Some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include: 

Inadequate capitalization
Failure to issue stock
Failure to observe corporate formalities
Nonpayment of dividends
Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time
Non-functioning of other officers or directors
Absence of corporate records
Commingling of funds
Diversion of assets
Failure to maintain arm's length relationships among related entities
Whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders

A possible benefit of an LLC over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors (failure to issue stock, failure to observe corporate formalities, and absence of corporate records) have no real counterparts in an LLC.  However, as case law develops, the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors.
Distributions in Violation of Law or Agreement
LLC Acts typically prohibit an LLC from making certain distributions.  For example, the final draft of the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution: (1) the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities; or (2) the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.
A member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution  is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions. In addition, a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the Act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper.
Is Limited Liability an Illusion?
Although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule, the LLC offers excellent protection from many types of 
liabilities.  For example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud, the LLC should shield you from personal liability.  If you sell a product that, without your knowledge or fault, is defective, you should not have personal liability.  Trade creditors who deal with the LLC without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment.
Shoring up Limited Liability
There are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the LLC:
Business insurance.  Carrying adequate business insurance won't change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence, but it can help by providing a source for payment.  You might also consider a personal umbrella policy.
Avoid personal guarantees.  Not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee.  In many cases, landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided.  Learn to question the request.
Capitalize the business adequately.  Provide adequate capital for the entity's intended purposes and document the capital infusion.
Keep the LLC separate from your personal business.  No matter how small the business is, it should have its own bank account.  Don't pay personal expenses from the business account.  Instead, write yourself a check (called a draw) on the LLC account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses.  Likewise, don't use personal checks to pay LLC bills.  If the LLC needs funds, make a capital contribution or loan.  And account for everything.
Act ethically.  Don't attempt to mislead the LLC's creditors about the financial condition of the business.
Do not divert assets.  If the business looks like it is going down, don't attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the LLC.  That will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets.
If you act responsibly and take a few precautions, the limited liability of the LLC is still a major benefit over a sole proprietorship or general partnership.
