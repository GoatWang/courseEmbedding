National Bank Holdings Corporation About Us










About Us
 
National Bank Holdings Corporation is a bank holding company created to build a leading community bank franchise delivering high quality client service and committed to shareholder results. National Bank Holdings Corporation operates a network of 86 banking centers located in Colorado, the greater Kansas City region and Texas. Through the Company's subsidiary, NBH Bank, it operates under the following brand names: Bank Midwest in Kansas and Missouri, Community Banks of Colorado in Colorado, and Hillcrest Bank in Texas.
 
Our Beliefs
 
Common sense has never been common. If it were, the world would be a different place.
Things would run smoothly and on time. People would do what they say and say what they do. Everything would be fair, without all the small type.
And banks would only sell you what you need. When your banker looked at you they wouldn't just see a number, they'd see a dad or a mom or a graduate or a business owner. They'd understand the complexities of people's lives and offer simple solutions.
That's why we bank with common sense and we invite you to do the same.
That means straight talk, personal attention, and sensible, clear decisions from real people. No jibber jabber, no smoke and mirrors and no passing the buck. And no making you talk to a machine when what you need is a person.
If that makes sense to you, then you might be right for us.
And we might be right for you.
Where Common Sense Lives.
For more information, please view the video below.


 
Our Community Service
 
We've been told time again that getting the fundamentals right is the best way we can help the community. But we're not satisfied with that answer. We'd like to help in other ways too. That's why as a bank and as individuals, we put aside some time and money to help out. Here are a few things we do.
We help people understand money.
It's just common sense that people who understand what they're signing make better decisions, so we dedicate a portion of our time to providing financial education to our clients and the public. We also support institutions and other efforts in the community to improve people's understanding of financial products and how they work.
We help people find work.
If you want to work, we think you should be able to work. So we are dedicated to helping those who want to work get the jobs they are looking for. Not only do we hire a diverse range of local people ourselves, but we also volunteer for and support organizations that help people get back on their feet and move forward with their plans.
We help people find quality housing.
Without affordable housing, it's hard for people to get back on their feet and find the jobs they're looking for. That's why, in addition to providing financing for individual homes and developments, we also support organizations that provide quality low-income housing.

National Bank Holdings Stock Sees Short Interest Plummet 52%
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 12/31/2015 settlement date, which shows a 696,411 share decrease in total short interest for National Bank Holdings Corp , to 644,512, a decrease of 51.94% since 12/15/2015. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.
