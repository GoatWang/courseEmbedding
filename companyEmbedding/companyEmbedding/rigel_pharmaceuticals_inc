rigel fostamatinib ITP



























































 























Fostamatinib – ITP








Fostamatinib

Oral SYK Inhibitor for ITP:


Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood.  The result - abnormally low platelet counts. 
There are two forms of ITP: acute thrombocytopenic purpura, which is most commonly seen in young children; and chronic thrombocytopenic purpura, which requires continual follow up care with a hematologist.
There are approximately 60,000 to 125,000 patients with ITP in the U.S., and it qualifies as an orphan disease.
Rigel is focusing its Fostamatinib ITP program on the chronic form of this disorder targeting the underlying autoimmune cause of the disease rather than stimulating platelet production.
Antibodies, usually of the IgG type, mediate platelet destruction in ITP. Fostamatinib has a novel mechanism of action, blocking IgG receptor signaling in both macrophages and B cells via SYK kinase.
Rigel completed and reported results from the FIT Phase 3 clinical program of fostamatinib in ITP in 2016.
Rigel submitted an NDA to the FDA for fostamatinib in patients with chronic or persistent ITP in April 2017.

Rigel Pharmaceuticals Receives Approval from Food and Drug Administration for Tavalisse as Proprietary Name for Fostamatinib in the United States
Apr 27 17
Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conditionally accepted the proprietary name Tavalisse™ for the company's investigational product candidate, fostamatinib disodium, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor. In addition, Rigel has applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain federal registration of the Tavalisse mark. The name Tavalisse (pronounced - ta vah lees') was developed based on the FDA's Guidance for Industry, Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names. Created with the help of experts in this field, the proprietary name development included input from prescribers, pharmacists, linguists and employees to create a unique and approachable name. Earlier this month, the company announced that it submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Tavalisse in patients with chronic and persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The FDA previously granted Orphan Drug designation to Tavalisse for the treatment of patients with ITP. The NDA is supported by data from the Phase 3 clinical program for Tavalisse in ITP, which was comprised of three studies, two randomized placebo-controlled studies (Studies 047 and 048) and an open-label extension study (Study 049). In total, 163 ITP patients have been treated with Tavalisse and included in the NDA submission. Across all indications, Tavalisse has been evaluated in over 4,600 subjects.
