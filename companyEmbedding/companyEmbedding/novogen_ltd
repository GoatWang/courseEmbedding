Novogen has two drug technology platforms (the Superbenzopyran (SBP) technology and Anti-tropomyosin (ATM)) yielding various drug candidates across a range of oncology indications. The Company's product candidates include Cantrixil (TRX-E-002-1), Anisina (ATM-3507) and Trilexium (TRX-E-009-1). The Company's target indication for Cantrixil is ovarian cancer, and Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) for Trilexium. The initial target pediatric indication for Anisina is neuroblastoma.Cantrixil (TRX-E-002-1)Cantrixil is the lead development candidate arising from its SBP technology. Cantrixil has been designed to be injected into the peritoneal cavity with the focus of inducing cell death in both differentiated cancer cells and cancer initiating cells, those cells thought to be primarily responsible for cancer recurrence post chemotherapy. The Company focuses on the Phase I study of intra-peritoneal Cantrixil to assess its pharmacokinetics in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.Anisina (ATM3507)Anisina is an approach to chemotherapy that targets the cancer cells' actin cytoskeleton. Anisina is an ATM small molecule targeting a protein component of actin microfilaments called tropomyosin Tpm3.1. Tpm3.1 as an onco-target, which focuses on the tumor cell survival. Novogen manufactures both the active candidate drug substance and candidate drug product using various methodologies. Anisina is in the pre-clinical development-stage. Anisina manages the anti-cancer activity used chemotherapeutics agents, such as the microtubule targeting compounds belonging to the taxanes and vinca alkaloid families.Trilexium (TRX-E-009-1)The Company's product, Trilexium (TRX-E-009-1), is its second lead SBP drug candidate. It is a therapy in early-stage pre-clinical development with application across a range of various cancer types.
