Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

Variable Annuities

The opportunity for market appreciation with tax-deferral






























Variable annuities provide the opportunity for market appreciation — through a variety of investment options — with tax-deferral and future income. Variable annuities are designed for people willing to take on more risk in exchange for greater growth potential. While there is risk associated with a variable annuity, many offer guarantees of principal and downside protection at an additional cost and depending on contract rider availability. However, these guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or amounts held in the variable investment options.













Investment Edge®
Defers current taxes when trying to accumulate wealth and provides tax-efficient distributions, adding powerful tax advantages to a diversified portfolio.


BENEFITSDiversificationTax-efficient Tax deferralDeath Benefit





Retirement Cornerstone®
A single tax-deferred platform comprised of two separate accounts with distinct features that help address different goals - offering the ability to not only accumulate, but also protect retirement income.


BENEFITSInvestment opportunityGuaranteed incomeDeath benefit guarantees





Structured Capital Strategies®
Several investment options, some of which allow participation in the upside potential of indices, up to a cap, that track certain domestic, international and commodities markets, and which have a built-in partial protection feature.
 


BENEFITSUpside potential up to a capPartial protectionTax deferral





The Accumulator® Series
A long-term retirement product that allows the ability to invest for growth potential on a tax-deferred basis. Also provides for guaranteed benefits through optional riders available for an additional fee.


BENEFITSInvestment Lifetime incomeDeath benefit






















Important Note AXA believes that education is a key step toward addressing your financial goals, and we've designed this material to serve simply as an informational and educational resource.  Accordingly, the information on this website does not offer or constitute investment advice and makes no direct or indirect recommendation of any particular product or of the appropriateness of any particular investment-related option.  Your needs, goals and circumstances are unique, and they require the individualized attention of your financial professional.
Annuities are long-term financial products designed for retirement purposes. In essence, annuities are contractual agreements in which payment(s) are made to an insurance company, which agrees to pay out an income or a lump sum amount at a later date. There are contract limitations and fees and charges associated with annuities, administrative fees, and charges for optional benefits. A financial professional can provide cost information and complete details. Variable annuities are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk, including loss of principal.
Withdrawals from annuities are subject to normal income tax treatment and if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to an additional 10% federal income tax penalty. Withdrawals may also be subject to a contractual withdrawal charge.
Please consider the charges, risk, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before purchasing a variable annuity. For a prospectus containing this and other information, please contact a financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY,NY).
Variable annuities are issued by AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (NY, NY) and co-distributed by affiliates AXA Distributors, LLC and AXA Advisors, LLC (members FINRA, SIPC).GE-92925 (10/2016)

PART B - CONTRACT CHARGES SCHEDULE                                              
PROGRAM EXPENSE CHARGE (CONTRACT SECTION 9.01)                                  
There will be an annual program expense charge; equal to the amount in          
subsections (a), plus the amount in subsection (b) of this Section 9.01, which  
shall be paid to AXA Equitable from the Funding Accounts in the Members         
Retirement Program.                                                             

(a)      A "Percentage Charge" consisting of the sum of the amounts derived by  
      multiplying the following percentages times the aggregate balance of
  the Funding Accounts in the Members Retirement Program as of the
immediately preceding January 31:                             
     (i)    [ 0.51%] of the first $500 million of the aggregate balance;
(ii)   [ 0.41%] of the next $500 million of the balance;      
(iii)  [0.318%] of the balance in excess of $1 billion.       
(b)      An [$80] per participant charge that will be adjusted annually with the
Consumer Price Index                                          

The Program expense charge may be changed as of any May 1 as communicated to the
Owner. The maximum Program Expense Charge will not exceed 1.00%.                

The program expense charge is calculated as of each January 31. One twelfth of  
the program expense charge will be charged to Participants' account balances    
computed on an equivalent daily basis during each of the 12 consecutive months  
beginning May 1 of the same calendar year.                                      

In the case of a Funding Account that is not valued every Business Day, a pro   
rata portion of the then applicable program expense charge will be charged to   
Participants' Accounts in such Funding Account on each Business Day for which a 
value is established.                                                           

On the date each GRA is opened, AXA Equitable will determine a pro rata portion 
of the then applicable program expense charge for amounts held in such GRA,     
which shall constitute the program expense charge for that GRA until its        
maturity. The net interest rate declared by AXA Equitable on a GRA will reflect 
the compounded effect of the then applicable program expense charge.            

ENROLLMENT FEE (CONTRACT SECTION 9.03)                                          
An enrollment fee of $25 shall be paid to AXA Equitable upon the enrollment of  
each new Participant. Unless the Participant's Employer pays the fee directly to
AXA Equitable, it shall be charged against the first contribution made on behalf
of the participant. AXA Equitable may, in its sole discretion, waive the        
enrollment fee from time to time for marketing purposes.                        

RECORD MAINTENANCE AND REPORT FEE  (CONTRACT SECTION 9.04)                      
A record maintenance and report fee of $3 shall be charged quarterly against    
each Participant's aggregate account balances in the Master Trust and Volume    
Submitter Trust and paid to AXA Equitable; such fee shall be $1 for account     
balances in the Pooled Trust which are not participating in a prototype plan    
offered through AXA Equitable. The fee shall be deducted from each Participant's
accounts, and within those accounts from the Participant's balance in each      
Funding Account, in accordance with the ordering rule.                          

WITHDRAWAL CHARGE- A withdrawal by a participant from the plan is subject to IRS
regulations and if applicable a Redemption Fee (a fee to dissuade disruptive    
trading activity) or GRA interest rate adjustment. Withdrawals from GRAs are    
prohibited except as described below:                                           

A Participant may withdraw the balance of his interest in the GRAs provided by  
AXA Equitable before maturity without incurring an interest rate adjustment     
provided that the withdrawal is made as a result of the following events:       

   a) upon separation from service (including retirement) by a Participant other
than a dentist,                                                     
b) retirement after age 59-1/2 by a dentist under an annuity or           
installment of at least three years' duration,                      
c) upon receipt by AXA Equitable of due proof of death of the Participant,
d) upon the Participant's "Disability", as defined in Section 5.01 of the 
Contract, or                                                        
e) attainment of age 70-1/2 by the Participant.                           

A dentist may withdraw the balance of his GRAs provided by AXA Equitable upon   
retirement after 59-1/2 under a distribution option of less than three years'

AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION MEMBERS RETIREMENT PROGRAM
OPERATIONS AGREEMENT FOR GUARANTEED RATE ACCOUNTS 
I.       INVESTMENT CELL DEFINITION                                             
--------------------------                                    

      Each contract will consist of fifty-two class year investment cells.
        There will be a one-day lag between the open dates of the cells at AXA
        Equitable and the corresponding open dates at Principal. AXA Equitable
  open periods will run from Wednesday until the close of business
  Tuesday of the following week. The corresponding open periods at
        Principal will run from Thursday to the close of business Wednesday of
       the following week. Participant contributions will be made during the
      AXA Equitable open period (Wednesday - Tuesday) at the interest rate
    set by Principal for the corresponding open period. Similarly, all
         maturities will occur at AXA Equitable on a Tuesday and at Principal on
       the Wednesday, one business day later. The contract period will begin
        with the first cell established on Thursday, July 19, 2007 (for monies
        received at AXA Equitable from July 18, 2007 to July 24, 2007) and end
       with the last cell established on July 17, 2008, (for monies received
at AXA Equitable from July 9, 2008 to July 15, 2008).         

II.      INVESTMENT CELL IDENTIFICATION                                         
------------------------------                                

         A joint numbering system is essential for proper reconciliation between
        Principal and AXA Equitable. We have agreed, for each contract, that a
       number system from 1-52 will be used, assuming a one-year period. The
       first cell for the three-year GRA and the first for the five-year GRA
will, therefore, be identified as cell #1 under each contract.

III.     CASHFLOW ESTIMATE COMMUNICATION                                        
-------------------------------                               

        Each business day starting July 19, 2007, Valerie Wade or her designee
       at AXA Equitable, will call Linda Crawford at Principal to advise her
        of the net cash flows and maturities, if any, to be added to the three
       and five year GRAs. A worksheet will be faxed to Principal to confirm
         the information and provide the necessary detail by investment cell. As
      part of this transmission, AXA Equitable will clearly communicate to
        Principal which cells money is to be added to and which cells money is
     to be withdrawn from. Withdrawals will be administered on a last in
 first out basis from the various investment cells in which that
      participant's balances are held. This transmission of information to
        Principal will occur as early in the day as possible. Generally, it is
agreed this will occur before 11:00 a.m. EST.                 

       AXA Equitable will provide an estimate of the amount held in existing
       weekly GRAs scheduled for rollover to a new GRA. These estimates will
      be e-mailed to Principal on the Friday preceding each such maturity.

IV.      ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER FACILITY                                     
----------------------------------                            

       Each day there will be one wire transfer either from AXA Equitable to
  Principal or from Principal to AXA Equitable. Such transfer will
         combine transactions in the Three-Year and Five-Year GRAs and will be a
        net amount including contributions and withdrawals. If such net amount
      is positive, AXA Equitable will transfer the amount to Principal. If
        such is negative, Principal will send the amount to AXA Equitable. For
     disbursements, Principal agrees that it will wire funds on the same
      day, provided AXA Equitable gives notice before 11:00 a.m. All wires
      will be preceded by detailed faxed information from AXA Equitable to
Principal specifying contributions and withdrawals by cell.   

V.       INTEREST RATE ESTABLISHMENT                                            
---------------------------                                   

         Linda Crawford, or her designee at Principal, will establish the weekly
      interest rates in accordance with the pricing formula. Each Tuesday,
     Principal will determine the Three-Year and Five-Year Treasury Note
     constant maturity as reported in the WALL STREET JOURNAL. The yield
will be calculated in accordance with contract specifications.

         For the Three-Year Weekly GRAs the guaranteed pricing formula calls for
      Principal to guarantee a positive spread of 90 (Ninety) basis points
        over the three year Treasury Note rate. For the Five-Year Weekly GRAs,
        a guaranteed positive spread of 110 (One Hundred and Ten) basis points
    over the five year Treasury Note rate will apply. These guaranteed
        credited interest rates are net of Principal's administrative fees but
     do not reflect the deduction of AXA Equitable's Program Expense and
   Administration Charges which will be calculated by AXA Equitable,
         payable to AXA Equitable monthly as a withdrawal from each of the cells
       established under these contracts, and deducted by AXA Equitable from
the rate payable to participants.                             

    The interest rate to be credited will be an effective annual yield
        based on a 365-day year. AXA Equitable understands that, during a leap
        year, such as 2008, Principal will use daily interest factors based on
     a 366-day year, and Principal will credit interest for February 29.

    Principal's daily interest factors extend 9 (nine) places from the
 decimal point. AXA Equitable (the recordkeeper) will absorb any
     residual interest differences resulting from cash flow timing, leap
     year or from daily interest factors being slightly different at the
fund level.                                                   

VI.      INTEREST RATE COMMUNICATION TO AXA EQUITABLE                           
--------------------------------------------                  

      Each Tuesday, starting July 17, 2007, Linda Crawford or her designee
  from Principal, will e-mail Peter Tang at AXA Equitable with the
    current GRA rates for the three and five year offerings on Tuesday
        morning no later than 10AM EST. Peter's backups are Rick Argente and /
or Linda Humphrey.

VII.     INTEREST ADJUSTMENT CONTRIBUTIONS                                      
---------------------------------                             

       Principal credits interest on its GRAs from date of deposit up to but
       not including date of withdrawal. AXA Equitable accounts for interest
  beginning the date after deposit up to and including the date of
      withdrawal. For most deposit transactions, this will not produce any
      interest differences between AXA Equitable and Principal. However, a
difference in the amount of interest credited will exist on   
       contributions received on Fridays and on any business day preceding a
        holiday on which AXA Equitable or Principal is closed. For example, if
       AXA Equitable receives a deposit on Friday, interest will be credited
      to participants on Saturday and Sunday. Principal would receive this
same contribution from AXA Equitable on Monday and would begin
    crediting interest then. This will produce an interest difference,
     which, to some extent, will be offset by withdrawals being paid out
        Fridays. It is estimated the total difference will be not greater than
  $5,000 for both contracts at the end of the accumulation period.

  In order to reconcile this difference, AXA Equitable will make a
onetime payment to these contracts, or request a withdrawal,  
     representing the amount of difference. AXA Equitable will determine
    these amounts in July 2008 at the end of the last open period, and
         forward them in one wire per contract to Principal. A letter indicating
      the amount to be allocated to each cell will also be sent. Principal
         agrees to process these adjustments to the appropriate cells. Principal
will record this one time principal payment or withdrawal as a
contribution or withdrawal.                                   

VIII.    PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL PENALTY                                           
----------------------------                                  

    Certain types of withdrawals are subject to a premature withdrawal
    penalty. The plan provisions that govern these withdrawals and the
     penalty formula are described in the GRA specifications prepared by
William Mercer Asset Planning.                                

P-->EX-99.8H4th Page of 7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 4th
       AXA Equitable will calculate the premature penalty in its participant
     recordkeeping area in accordance with the formula. Principal agrees
that no penalties will be taken from contracts other than that
currently open for contributions.                             

    Valerie Wade will communicate the withdrawal and penalty amount to
        Principal. Principal will withdraw from the contract(s) the withdrawal
         amount and the penalty amount and, for fund balance reporting purposes,
         reduce the cell(s) by both amounts. However, only the withdrawal amount
       will actually be paid out to AXA Equitable. Principal will retain the
penalty amount.                                               

IX.      DEDUCTION OF AXA EQUITABLE FEES                                        
-------------------------------                               

        Principal acknowledges that fee deductions will be withdrawn from each
       of the cells established under both contracts. These fees include the
         Program Expense Charge, the investment accounting fee and certain other
         charges described in the Prospectus. These amounts will not be reported
         to Principal as a separate transaction, but will be combined with other
      benefit withdrawals. As with such withdrawals, Principal will reduce
    the cells by the appropriate amounts and wire these amounts to AXA
       Equitable the same day they are reported, if they are reported before
11:00 a.m.                                                    

X.       FUND BALANCE REPORTING                                                 
----------------------                                        

     Linda Crawford or her designee at Principal, will prepare a monthly
     fund balance statement for each investment cell under each contract
       (Once contributions have been added to all investment cells Principal
will prepare 104 fund balance statements).                    

     These reports will include: 1) beginning balance, 2) details of all
         transactions, 3) interest credited, 4) ending balance. The monthly fund
       balance information will be released to Valerie Wade, or her designee
   at AXA Equitable, by the third business day after the end of each
       reporting month. All questions concerning the fund balance statements
should be directed to Linda Crawford at Principal.            

XI.      INVESTMENT CELL MATURITY                                               
------------------------                                      

    For the 3-Year Contract, Principal will make payment of the entire
      balance in each investment cell on the Wednesday, which is 156 weeks
 after the close of the cell's contribution term. For the 5-Year
    Contract Principal will make payment of the entire balance in each
        investment cell on the Wednesday which is 260 weeks after the close of
the cell's contribution term.                                 

XII.     FORM 5500 REPORTING                                                    
-------------------                                           

   Principal will prepare its normal 5500 report for both contracts.
      Principal will record the one time interest adjustment contribution,
defined in item VII of this agreement, as a contribution. Fee 
deductions from each contract will be reported as

         withdrawals for Form 5500 reporting purposes. Form 5500 reports will be

XIII.    HOLIDAY PROCEDURES                                                     
------------------                                            

       If a Principal holiday or a state bank holiday prevents AXA Equitable
         from forwarding amounts to Principal and such delay results in a weekly
        cell having been closed, Principal agrees to treat those amounts as if
   they had been received for the cell, which would have been opened
except for the holiday closing. This will avoid increasing the
        differences in Principal's and AXA Equitable fund balances as a result
    of timing differences. Following is a list of the bank and company
         holidays. Note, if one of those holidays falls on a Saturday or Sunday,
    Principal will be open on either the preceding Friday or following
    Monday. The days in 2007 and 2008 on which Principal is closed are
noted.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

How can I change the beneficiary on my annuity contract?

The beneficiary can be changed at the written request of the contract owner.  Click here to print a request form and instructions.  After completing and signing, return to us at the address noted on the form.
Did this answer your question? Yes / No



Do I need spousal consent to change a beneficiary?

This only applies to certain plans. For TSA plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and all Non-Trusteed Keogh (HR-10) plans and contracts which were formerly trustee-owned: If the Annuitant is a current or former Annuitant in one of these plans, the spouse's consent is required for any payment other than in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor life annuity. 
Spousal Consent is required for loans, withdrawals or surrenders, as the spouse is entitled to benefits under the retirement plan according to the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA). For Trusteed (Corporate and Keogh (HR-10)) plans, the Trustee, by signing the disbursement request form as Contract Owner, certifies that either spousal consent will be received by the Trustee prior to distribution, or that the Annuitant is unmarried and that the notice required by the Internal Revenue Code will be or has been given to the Annuitant, or a former annuitant of a Qualified Retirement Plan.
If an Annuitant were naming someone other than his/her spouse as the beneficiary of a contract that is subject to ERISA, he/she would need to have his/her spouse's signature as well as his/her own. The spouse would be agreeing to have someone other than himself or herself assigned as the beneficiary, and would need to have their signature notarized. By their signature they are agreeing to forfeit their entitlement to the benefits of the contract. If the participant is not married, they would need to state that on the beneficiary request form and have their signature notarized.

Investment Information


How can I obtain investment information?

AXA-Equitable.com, your online information source for the status and current values of your AXA Equitable life and annuity contracts, does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios available to you.
Did this answer your question? Yes / No



How is the value of the investment options determined?

Amounts that you allocate under your variable annuity contract to any of the investment options are invested in a corresponding "Portfolio" that is part of EQ Advisors Trust. The value of your variable investment option is measured in "units".
Each unit has a "unit value". While the unit value relates to the net asset value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio, there is not a one-to-one correlation in the dollar amount. For example, if at the time of the portfolio's inception the net asset value of the portfolio was $10.00 per share, the unit value of the corresponding investment option may actually have been $100.00 per unit. If the portfolio's net asset value grew to $11.00 per share the next day, the unit value of the corresponding variable investment option would have increased proportionately, but not by the exact same dollar amount.
The value of each unit will increase or decrease each day and reflect all reinvested dividends and distributions from the corresponding Portfolio.  The daily unit value calculation will also take into account the deduction of any mortality and expense risk charges that apply under your contract/policy.
The number of your units in any variable investment option does not change, unless there is an event or transaction under your contract/policy that involves moving assets into or out of that option.  Whenever any amount is withdrawn or deducted from one of your contract/policy's variable investment options, we "redeem" the number of units that has a value equal to that amount, on the effective date of the redemption.  This happens, for example, when all or a portion of monthly deductions and transaction-based charges are allocated to that option, or when loans, transfers, withdrawals and surrenders are made from that option.
Your investment results in a variable investment option will depend on those of the related Portfolio.  Any gains will generally be tax deferred.
Daily Unit Values are available online, for most variable life and annuity contracts, through AXA-Equitable.com. From the Portfolio Summary screen, click on the contract number to view unit prices and account details.
The investment options available under your variable contract are not publicly traded mutual funds.  As such, they do not have security or ticker symbols like publicly traded mutual funds and cannot be accessed via public mutual fund lookup sites. 
Did this answer your question? Yes / No



What is the current Guaranteed Interest Option interest rate?

The current interest rate, and how long the interest rate is guaranteed, is displayed at the bottom of the Account Details screen in AXA-Equitable.com. To find out what the lifetime guaranteed minimum interest rate is for the Guaranteed Interest Option for your contract, please refer to your contract for details.
Did this answer your question? Yes / No






Performance Information


How can I obtain performance information?

AXA-Equitable.com displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within most of our variable life and annuity contracts.  Select the "View" link under "Performance Information" on the Portfolio Summary page. 
Performance information is a multiple page report, showing the month-end and the quarter-end-annualized rates of return of the EQ Advisors Trust Portfolios.  To ensure that you have a clear understanding of the numbers that are presented, it is essential that you read both of the reports and the footnotes on each.  Use the page down key or the scroll bar to view the second report.
Did this answer your question? Yes / No



What are key points on Performance Information reports?

Some information to keep in mind as you review the month-end and the quarter-end reports through AXA-Equitable.com:

Annualized rates of return are based on the percentage change in net asset value with dividends and capital gains reinvested
Investment Performance of the EQ Advisors Trust (the Trust is a registered investment company which holds portfolios that correspond to the investment options available under your variable annuity contract) is calculated after deduction of investment management fees and direct operating expenses of the Trust
The investment options available under your variable contract are not publicly traded mutual funds.  As such, they do not have security or ticker symbols like publicly traded mutual funds and cannot be accessed via public mutual fund lookup sites. 
Please note that while some of these investment options may have similar names, investment managers and investment objectives as publicly traded mutual funds, they are completely separate portfolios that are collectively administered through the EQ Advisors Trust.  In general, you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfolios.  Major factors that can contribute to these differences include:

the portfolio's underlying fee structure (management and administrative expenses)
insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses (not applicable to mutual funds)
the timing of the portfolio's purchase and sale of securities
differences in cash flows (new sales and redemptions)
other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes (not applicable to variable portfolios given their tax-deferred status)
Did this answer your question? Yes / No



Why does the rate of return differ, between different variable products, for the same investment option?

Annualized rates of return may differ because the fees and expenses associated with the particular investment option are different under the two products.  Check your policy/contract prospectus for details on the fees and expenses of the investment portfolios.
Note that Annualized Rates of Return are not representative of the actual return you would receive under your contract.  Changes in contract values depend not only on the investment performance of the various options, but also on applicable contract and administrative charges, applicable sales charges and the mortality and expense risk charges that are deducted.  Contributions made to your contract, as well as any loans or withdrawals, will also affect its values.
Did this answer your question? Yes / No

Depending on the type of contract you have and your individual circumstances, a withdrawal could disqualify your contract from special tax treatment, be taxable and/or subject to tax penalties. Equitable offers many different tax-deferred products, such as Tax Sheltered Annuities (TSA), IRAs and non-qualified annuities. We do not give tax and legal advice. We suggest that you contact a tax advisor to review your particular circumstances.

Will taxes be withheld on a withdrawal?

It depends on the type of contract and other factors. 
Distributions that are subject to 10% Federal Income tax withholding are:
Minimum Distributions from TSAs and Qualified Plans
Other Distributions from TSAs and Qualified Plans, which are not eligible rollover distributions, such as a death benefit to non-spouse 
Non-periodic distributions from all forms of IRAs, unless you are eligible and ask us not to withhold on your Request for Disbursement
The taxable amount of non-periodic distributions from Non-Qualified annuities, unless you are eligible and ask us not to withhold on your Request for Disbursement.
Distributions that are subject to 20% Federal Income Tax withholding are eligible rollover distributions from TSAs, Annuitant-Owned Keogh/HR-10 contracts or other Qualified Retirement plans (including non-transferable Annuities) paid to you and not rolled over.
Distributions to Foreign Nationals are subject to 30% Federal Income Tax withholding unless the payment is eligible for a lower tax treaty rate and the recipient properly documents eligibility before the disbursement is processed.

Do I need spousal consent for a withdrawal?

This only applies to certain plans. For TSA plans subject to the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and all Non-Trusteed Keogh (HR-10) plans and contracts which were formerly trustee owned: If the Annuitant is a current or former participant in one of these plans, the spouse's consent is required for any payment other than in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor life annuity. 
Spousal Consent is required for loans, withdrawals or surrenders, as the spouse is entitled to benefits under  the retirement plan according to the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA). For Trusteed (Corporate and Keogh (HR-10)) plans, the Trustee, by signing the disbursement request form as Contract Owner, certifies that either spousal consent will be received by the Trustee prior to distribution, or that the Annuitant is unmarried and that the notice required by the Internal Revenue Code will be or has been given to the Annuitant, or a former annuitant of a Qualified Retirement Plan.

Can I check the investment options in mutual fund listings?

The investment options available to you through your AXA Equitable variable annuity contract are not publicly traded funds and do not appear in the mutual fund listings that are published in many daily newspapers. Barron's, a financial weekly newspaper, does include a listing for variable annuities and life accounts in its "Market Week" section. The unit price, four-week percent total return and a 52- week percent total return is reported (as of a specified date) for the investment portfolios available for selected AXA Equitable variable annuities. The Wall Street Journal, every Monday, lists Variable Annuities in the "Money and Investing" section (Section C). Look for "AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company."

Can I download values into Quicken®?

Programs like Quicken® and Microsoft® Money use ticker symbols of publicly traded stocks and retail mutual funds to gather their data. Neither your AXA Equitable contracts nor the funds that back them are retail mutual funds and therefore do not have ticker symbols.  The investment portfolios that you have access to within your policy or contract do not have ticker symbols, so you won't be able to look them up on mutual fund sites to determine their most current price.

AXA-Equitable.com, your online information source for the status and current values of your AXA Equitable life and annuity contracts, does provide you with the most recent closing price for all the investment portfolios you have available to you. In addition, Online access also displays monthly and quarterly annualized rates of return for the portfolios available within our variable life and annuity contracts. 
Please remember that while several of your variable investment options do indeed have substantially similar investment strategies and policies of publicly traded mutual funds, they are subject to different management fees and expenses. Furthermore, the actual performance under your individual policy or contract reflects insurance and contract charges, which would not apply in a typical mutual fund.  In general, you should be aware of the differences when comparing performance of mutual funds and their variable annuity or variable life counterpart portfolios. Major factors that can contribute to these differences include: 

the portfolio's underlying fee structure (management and administrative expenses),
insurance and contract related charges in addition to management expenses (not applicable to mutual funds) 
the timing of the portfolio's purchase and sale of securities; differences in cash flows (new sales and redemptions); and, 
other strategies employed by the fund manager for tax purposes (not applicable to variable portfolios given their tax-deferred status)

Why do unit values for the same investment option differ between different variable products?

Unit values for the same investment option under different variable products may differ because:The types or level of charges deducted before the unit value is calculated may differ by product. Check your policy/contract prospectus for detail on charges for the particular product.
The policies/contracts were introduced in different years and a new set of unit prices was established.Note that although the two products may have different unit values for the same investment option, the annualized rates of return for the products may in fact be the same. You can access performance/rate of return information from the Portfolio Summary screen of AXA-Equitable.com.

Required Min Distribution


How has the calculation of the minimum required distribution amount changed?

The Proposed Treasury Regulations significantly simplified the "account-based" method     
of calculating the minimum required distribution amount.
Among other things, the regulations provide the use of a single life 
expectancy table based solely on the life of the participant for most situations when 
the participant reaches his or her required beginning date.  The only exception is when the sole primary beneficiary is a spouse who is more than ten years younger than the participant.  In this situation the Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy table may be used.
The individuals who are required to take minimum distributions will most likely be able to take smaller amounts from their account each year, allowing more of their assets the potential to grow.  The RMD amount and tax savings, if any, will depend on the age and value of the participant's retirement account.
A participant does not have to choose whether to recalculate or not to recalculate.  The factor to use in dividing the account value will depend upon the individual's age as of the year of the distribution. 
A person can change his/her beneficiary after age 701/2  without affecting his/her RMD.
