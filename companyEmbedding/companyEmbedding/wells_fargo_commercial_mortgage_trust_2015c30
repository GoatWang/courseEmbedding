      of July 16, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $8,329,000 class G, 
      $22,209,909 class H, $74,957,000 interest-only class X-B, $16,657,000 
      interest-only class X-FG, or the $22,209,909 interest-only class X-H 
      certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 101 loans secured by 111 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $740 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, 
      C-III Commercial Mortgage, LLC, Basis Real Estate Capital II, LLC, and 
      National Cooperative Bank, N.A.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 76.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 70.5%, and asset summary reviews on 73.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      and loan to value (LTV) are 1.44x and 104.9%, respectively. However, 
      excluding co-op collateral, the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.12x and 
      110.1%, respectively. This is slightly higher than other recent 
      Fitch-rated transactions. The 2014 and year-to-date (YTD) 2015 average 
      Fitch LTVs were 106.2% and 109.3%, respectively. The 2014 and YTD 2015 
      average Fitch DSCRs were 1.19x and 1.21x, respectively.
    

      Multifamily Concentration and Co-Op Collateral: Multifamily properties 
      comprise 34.6% of the pool, which is greater than the 2014 and YTD 2015 
      average multifamily concentration of 15.8% and 16%, respectively. 
      Multifamily has a below average probability of default in Fitch's 
      multiborrower CMBS model. Additionally, the pool contains 18 loans (6.5% 
      of the pool) secured by multifamily co-ops. All of the multifamily 
      co-ops are located in New York, within the New York City metro area. The 
      weighted average Fitch DSCR and LTV of the co-op collateral in this 
      transaction as rentals are 5.97x and 30.3%, respectively.
    

      Secondary Markets: Eight of the pool's top 10 loans are secured by 
      properties located in secondary or tertiary markets. Locations such as 
      Troy MI, Spokane, WA, Little Rock, AR, Columbus, OH, West Sacramento, 
      CA, and Slidell, LA are all represented by top 10 loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.6% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFCM 2015-C30 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in 
      which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence information was 
      provided on Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      101 mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the 
      ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary (RAC).

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
