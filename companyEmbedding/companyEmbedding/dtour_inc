Detour Graphic Design, Inc.












Award Winning  Advertising & Design
SINCE 1998






Big City Design
With Local Care






WE DON'T JUST DESIGN
We get results







Welcome to Detour!
Create a Different Route

Looking for a change in direction? At Detour Graphic Design we’re obsessed with your success. But we understand that achieving the end result is not always a straight shot. Sometimes you have to deviate from the norm and here we do just that! We create powerful messages by thinking in new and creative ways and we let our work speak for itself. The end result is innovative and effective, without losing sight of your bottom line. Get unstuck from the routine and come take the scenic route with us.   







The Purpose

Detour Graphic Design & New Media Inc. is a graphic design and photography studio headquartered in St. Charles, IL. We’ve been quietly earning a reputation for excellence since opening our doors in 1998. Our specialty is advertising, identity, packaging, print collateral and product/lifestyle photography.  








The Environment

At Detour Graphic Design we place absolute value on both creativity and originality. We believe that the right environment fosters creativity and outstanding design. So how do we separate ourselves from the pack? We hired world-renowned architect Keith Youngquist, of Dacre & Youngquist, to design our office. We promise just as much time and attention to detail in our work as we do our creative environment. We invite you to come check out both!







The Results

• Community Development Award - Office Design  
• Emerging Media Innovator - Web Design 
• Summit International Award - Identity 
• Marketing Effectiveness Award - Overall Branding 
• Summit International Award – Advertising 

These are just some of our recent awards. Our goal is to continue to provide superior, award winning quality work for our clients…which will make for a larger trophy case in our office!






Advertising
Impactful and Award Winning




Design Services
that stand out from the competition.  











Design

Do you like flipping through beautiful, high-gloss, textured brochures of advertising companies that seem way cooler than yours? Didn’t think so. Your products are better than theirs, your employees are better than theirs, and, hey, your products are of higher quality! So why aren’t you advertising the way your company deserves? Change things up and give us a call. We will work with you to create unique marketing pieces exclusive to both your industry and businesses’ needs. 













Photography

Photography is a critical aspect of successful marketing pieces, because, lets face it, you don’t read about beautiful design you see it. When it comes to photographing your products/business you could cut corners and hire someone with a DSLR and one semester of Photo 101 under their organic, fair-trade belt. Or you could call our team of expert photographers, retouchers and prepress professionals to capture everything from single-product to dynamic advertising shots and everything in between. Our photographers know a picture is worth 1,000 words; what will yours say?   













Marketing

Are you projecting the right image with your current brand and identity? Even if you haven’t fully fleshed it out, your brand is out there, right now, sending a message to potential clients/customers. In order to deliver a quality message, with a long-lasting impression, you have to utilize marketing materials people will associate with your products and services. Our design process implements research and refinement in order to achieve award-winning campaigns that are highly regarded by both our clients and peers. 








some words
from our clients





Detour Graphics Design takes a proactive approach to our marketing. They constantly remind us to stay consistent and focused; everything Detour creates for us “speaks” and they make sure that we don’t confuse our clients and prospects. They’ve helped us with branding, advertising and our web pages. They help us get base ideas off the ground and bring them to life. Simply put, Detour gets it done!

Kris Halverson, Excelsior Defense, Inc.





Detour has created Mikon International's corporate image as well as the Culinaire brand image. With their support and creativity our brand name is now known both nationally and internationally. Detour's vision and completion of our website, catalogs, advertising and sales flyer designs has positioned our company to compete with businesses many times larger than our company.

Mike Halles, Culinaire





Thanks to superb design ideas and excellent customer service Dave and his team at Detour Graphics Design and New Media, Inc. has taken Wagner Zip-Change, Inc. out off the dark ages! Our updated Logo was just the tip of the iceberg, our new website is exactly what we needed.

Laurie Crocetti, Wagner Zip










Top Projects
These are some of our favorite projects over the years






Hewlett Packard  Bag Design
We two different bags for 
                                       their events. This one was
                                       for their annual golf outing.









Rock N' Roll 5K
We created the iconic
                                       Rock N' Roll 5k logo and
                                       t-shirt design. 









Culinaire Website












Olcott Plastics
We were asked to get attention
                                       and we got it. The Jar Head
                                       campaign was a success.









Food Photography
We love to take photos
                                       that make peoples mouths
                                       water the moment they see them.











NOW Personal Care
We created not only a timeless
                                       campaign but an award winning 
                                       one as well. 









Petrol Performance
We created the identity and 
                                       branding for the Arizona based
                                       automotive performance company.











The Heart of Detour
exposed

Founder and Creative Director, David Enger, is no doubt the backbone of Detour. His unmatched ability to create under pressure and tireless work ethic are what helps separate us from the competition. Having over 20 years experience, a list of awards and numerous successful campaigns, you cannot be in better hands.
