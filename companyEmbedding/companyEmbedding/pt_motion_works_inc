[expand all][collapse all]



What is physical therapy?  

Physical therapy is a treatment approach for a variety of movement-related problems that make it hard for you to perform everyday activities. The goal of physical therapy is to restore your ability to return to all of the things you enjoy in life, both tasks around the house, caring for family, working, shopping, and participating in recreational and sporting activities. There are physical therapy techniques that help reduce pain, swelling, and scar tissue tightness, as well as restoring full joint range of motion, muscle flexibility, strength, and endurance. We also work on improving balance, gait (walking), getting in and out of bed, and going up and down stairs.Physical therapy is helpful after having a joint replaced, tendons or ligaments repaired or reconstructed, and if you have sustained a new or reoccurring injury to a nerve, tendon, joint, or muscle. Physical therapy can also be very helpful in conjunction with other medical treatments for diseases such as cancer, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spinal stenosis, and many others. Ask your physician if physical therapy may benefit you, or feel free to contact us at 920-215-2050 to discuss your medical condition. We will take the time to listen to your concerns to help determine whether or not we can help.  
 


What does a physical therapist do?  

Physical therapists tailor their treatment plan to the problems they find during your initial evaluation.  Treatment begins at the first appointment and may include modalities to reduce pain and swelling such as ice, ultrasound with medication, electrical stimulation with medication, and/or manual therapy (hands-on) techniques.  Manual therapy techniques may include soft tissue mobilization or massage, scar mobilization, joint mobilization, manipulation, and muscle energy techniques, among others.
Your physical therapist will also introduce specific exercises to help reduce pain and improve movement.  This home exercise program will be tweaked and modified throughout your physical therapy sessions, and they are the key to both short-term and long-term success.  Some exercises will help improve flexibility, while others may focus on balance, strengthening, general conditioning, and improving muscle endurance.
Physical therapy involves a lot of education regarding your diagnosis, issues, and treatment approaches to assist you in setting goals and taking charge of your own treatment plan.  At every visit you will receive some type of movement education as well to address your posture, ergonomics at home and work, home and/or work activity training and simulation, body mechanics training, and sport specific activities.
  
 


Do I need a physician referral?  

Provider referrals are always welcome, although the state of Wisconsin does not require a physician referral to attend physical therapy.  However, most insurance companies do still require a referral.  If you would like to find out for sure, you can contact your insurance company by calling the number on the back of your insurance card and asking them directly.  Most patients are already working with a nurse practitioner, chiropractor, physician, surgeon, podiatrist, or dentist who are more than willing to provide a script for physical therapy, many by just requesting this by phone.   Our office is happy to assist you with obtaining a referral and guiding you through this simple process.
  
 


Why choose MotionWorks Physical Therapy?  

MotionWorks Physical Therapy is a specialty, boutique provider of physical therapy services.  We focus on what we do best, our specialties of sports medicine and manual therapy for treatment of the spine and extremities, instead of providing average, full spectrum physical therapy services.  Our mission is to provide the highest level of personalized, one-on-one patient care, with appointment times that are convenient to you, close to where you live and work.  Our results speak for themselves, as we often can help those who have not seen a benefit from treatment provided elsewhere.
  
 


What insurance plans do you accept?  

The following list is not comprehensive, as we add new plans to the list all the time. If you do not see your insurance plan listed, please call us to check if we are an in-network provider for your health insurance. Call 920-215-2050.

What should I bring to my initial evaluation?  

Great question!  Please bring the referral form (prescription) from your physician, as well as your most recent insurance card, list of current medications, and a list of your medical history (if extensive).  If you have some imaging or test results, bring the testing report as well.  Also, if you use an assistive device such as a walker, cane, or crutches, please bring these to your appointment as well.
  
 


What will happen at my initial evaluation?  

Once you check in for your initial evaluation, you will be registered as a new patient.  This process includes answering a medical history questionnaire and providing a medication list, so your physical therapist can consider your medical history when developing your unique treatment plan.  After updating your physical therapist on your condition, related imaging or test results, current symptoms and problems, and previous treatments you have tried, your physical therapist will evaluate your condition.  This evaluation is specific to you and your diagnosis, but may include measurements of swelling, joint motion, strength, special tests, and functional tests as well as observation of posture and movement.
  
 


What should I wear for physical therapy appointments?  

Please wear some loose, comfortable clothes that you can move in and a pair of comfortable shoes.  It is also helpful to keep jewelry and perfume to a minimum.If you fall into one of these categories...You have a leg or knee injury: please bring or wear shortsYou are coming for any kind of sport, running, or movement assessment including custom orthotics: bring your walking, running, or sport specific performance shoes and bring or wear shorts and workout clothes!You have hair that is medium or long in length and we are treating your head, neck, and/or spine: bring an elastic band to put your hair upYou have an aquatic therapy appointment: please bring a towel, modest swimming suit, flip flops, and a cover-up  
 


Can I self pay for physical therapy services?  

Yes.  If we are not a preferred provider for your insurance plan, if you have a high deductible, or if your are seeking physical therapy services that are recreational or sports-related and not covered by your insurance plan, you may choose to self pay for physical therapy services.  We offer several payment and concierge service plans that serve as affordable payment options.
  
 


I have already tried physical therapy.  How will additional physical therapy at MotionWorks benefit me?  

The physical therapists at MotionWorks specialize in the tough to treat cases that may not be improving by the typical physical therapy approaches provided elsewhere.  We believe there is more to physical therapy than providing exercises and teaching you how to cope with your pain.  Our physical therapists provide thorough initial examinations as well as re-evaluations each visit to make sure we are on the right track to improve both your pain and function.  By finding and treating the source of the pain, and not just the symptoms, with a hands-on manual therapy approach, we have delivered success for patients who were struggling to improve.  We do not provide a magic bullet, but we will teach you how to manage any on-going symptoms with self-treatment techniques, modify activities including work-outs based on you feel each day, and make everyday postures and movements safely and more efficient without flaring your symptoms.
  
 


What are your specialties?  

Our physical therapists specialize in sports medicine and manual therapy (soft tissue mobilization, myofascial release, scar mobilization, joint mobilization and manipulation, and muscle energy techniques) for the treatment of sports injuries, spine, neck, and TMJ dysfunction, and tension headaches.

What is Manual Therapy?







Share This: 






Many patients, friends, and family all ask the same question when they hear the term “manual therapy.” What is it? Who does it? What is it good for? Why doesn’t everyone do it? We hope shed some light and answer these frequently asked questions right here.
Manual therapy is often defined slightly differently, depending on the medical professional’s scope of practice, whether an osteopathic doctor (DO), a chiropractor, or a physical therapist. In the physical therapy field, manual therapy is utilizing skilled, hands-on techniques, including but not limited to manipulation/mobilization, used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissue and joints to reduce pain, increase range of motion, decrease myofascial restrictions to improve muscle length, decrease swelling or inflammation, assist the body in muscle or soft tissue repair, extensibility and/or stability, and facilitate movement to improve function. (Whew! Thanks to Wikipedia for some assistance with that definition!)
That’s a whole lot of words, but manual therapy is really a large umbrella under which many specific hands-on techniques reside. Here’s a list of the manual therapy techniques we could come up with (we still may have missed a few):
Soft tissue techniques

Massage
Manual lymph drainage
Soft tissue mobilization
Functional mobilization
Scar mobilization
Myofascial release
Strain counterstrain
Craniosacral therapy
Active Release Technique (ART)
Feldenkrais
Graston

Joint techniques

Joint mobilization
Joint manipulation/thrust
Muscle energy techniques
Mulligan techniques
Traction


While some of these techniques are not as well-known or common as others, most of us have experienced some type of manual therapy in our lifetime. Getting a massage is one of the best self-rewarding treats you can give to most individuals. Anyone who has seen a chiropractor most certainly has experienced one of these types of manual therapy. And who hasn’t given someone a chair massage to reduce stress and headaches. If you think about it, frequently humans will unknowingly rub their skin or fidget some other way to self-soothe during a stressful moment during the day. Just ask a body language specialist.
Why is the sense of touch so soothing? We know that massaging premature babies improves their health, just like rubbing a fussy baby’s back can reduce the pain felt from gas, injury, or teething. When a toddler trips and falls, he gets up immediately and finds his mom for the all-important hug and kiss to make the boo-boo feel better. The benefits of touch are many, from soothing a hypersensitive nervous system, improving sleep patterns, and boosting the immune system. When manual therapy is used in a physical therapy setting, we know that scars become pain-free, soft tissue restrictions melt away, and joint motion improves. A physical therapist can help reduce edema, perform techniques to control lymphedema, and unload joints to reduce pain even during the most ordinary orthopedic treatment of stretching a joint to improve motion.
For what type of injuries or problems is manual therapy helpful?  Here's a partial list:

Neck Pain: disc pathology, muscle spasm, rib hypomobility, post-surgical neck pain
Low Back Pain: disc pathology, facet joint impingement/hypomobility, spinal stenosis, post-surgical back pain
Thoracic spine/Mid-back Pain
Headaches: tension headaches, migraines
TMJ Dysfunction
Hip Pain: hip impingement, myofascial hip pain in the buttock or lateral hip, hip bursitis, post-surgical hip replacements
Knee Pain: patellofemoral dysfunction, IT band tendonitis, post-surgical knees including total knee replacements
Ankle Pain: ankle sprains, chronic ankle pain, ankle arthritis, post-surgical ankle pain
Shoulder Pain: impingement syndrome, scapular dyskinesia, frozen shoulder/adhesive capsulitis, post-surgical shoulder
Fibromyalgia

Manual therapy is not just the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae when it comes to its importance in physical therapy treatment. Rather it is more like the spoon you need to eat your ice cream. You could try other ways to eat a sundae from a dish, but none of them would be as easy, smooth, enjoyable, or as effective as using a spoon. The same can be said for manual therapy. You can certainly find physical therapists who do not use this approach, but you will never know if you could have overcome your injury faster, or reached a higher level, without the assistance of a manual physical therapist. It’s kind of like trying to change the oil in your car without that all critical oil filter wrench to loosen the old and tighten the new filter. You’ll still have fresh oil, but it sure is a lot harder, takes a lot longer, and without a new filter, why just change the oil? It’s leaving the job incomplete. So is physical therapy without any hands-on techniques.
So why doesn’t every physical therapist do manual therapy techniques? I would venture to say that just about every physical therapist does some sort of manual therapy technique at one time or another. But why not use it whenever it could be of assistance in the rehabilitation process? It takes a lot of time, hands-on learning, and skill to become adept at performing the most complex manual therapy techniques. To be able to assess the problems with soft tissues and joints with your hands alone, without the assistance of imaging (soft tissue and joint restrictions are not typically visible in most imaging anyway, other than the new and rare tool of musculoskeletal imaging) takes a special ability to feel these difference in tissue consistency. This is both a gift and a combined motor and sensory skill that takes time and patience to master, that perhaps not every practitioner can or chooses to pursue.
This is one of the reasons why we tell patients to give MotionWorks Physical Therapy a try, even if you have not had success with physical therapy in the past. We do things quite a bit differently here, combining the best of hands-on, manual therapy techniques with functional strength and stability critical for not only reducing pain, but restoring your body to healthy and efficient movement patterns. Every physical therapist here is skilled and knowledgeable in this approach to physical therapy, and every patient receives best in class care by people who really care. Experience the difference that a hands-on approach to physical therapy can make at MotionWorks!

If we can’t help you, we’ll send you to someone who can.Our physical therapists and  insurance billing specialist take the time to complete all of the paperwork and phone calls necessary to assure the highest level of insurance reimbursement for the services we provide.  We take care of every detail, obtaining timely authorizations to prevent any delays in obtaining treatment, and filing reviews and appeals as needed on our patients' behalf.  At MotionWorks Physical Therapy, our patients are the boss, not insurance companies.  We provide appropriate therapy services to the extent necessary for you to meet your functional goals not limited by incentives offered by some local provider and insurance networks that make money by rationing the care you receive with a pre-determined limited number of visits, whether or not your have met your goals.MotionWorks Physical Therapy is a group of physical therapists dedicated to providing a premier level of care to our patients, utilizing the highest level of skilled services and personalized, hands-on care that only a boutique physical therapy practice can deliver. An increasing rarity in the current cost-cutting climate of healthcare, you will be treated by the same physical therapist who evaluated you, not by a PT assistant you’ve never met. After all, who knows what you need better than the person who assessed your movement pattern to begin with? If your physical therapist does happen to be out of the office for a day, your optimal physical therapy experience will be provided by another physical therapist who is equally skilled and just as dedicated to meeting your individual therapy needs as your primary provider. This is why our patients get better, faster. MissionWith specialties in sports medicine and manual physical therapy, MotionWorks Physical Therapy will be the provider of choice for exceptional quality orthopedic physical therapy services to improve the health and well-being of individuals in Neenah/Menasha and the greater Fox Valley community. VisionMotionWorks Physical Therapy is founded on the following principles:Patients will be thoroughly evaluated to accurately determine and treat the actual source of the problem, not just the symptoms, which will help reduce the risk of re-injury.By assisting clients to achieve efficient movement patterns and improved neuromuscular balance, optimal function will be attained in an expedited fashion.Patients are treated in a comprehensive manner, addressing the needs and goals of the whole person.Physical therapy will be provided in a clean, comfortable, relaxing, encouraging, and supportive environment to promote healing.Physical therapy staff continually strives to improve and update clinical skills by attending specialty education courses.Physical therapists function as part of a healthcare team that consists of local physicians, specialty physicians, and other health care providers to provide timely and effective injury management and healthcare utilization.Patients will receive the highest quality physical therapy services by physical therapists specifically trained to meet their needs.

The MotionWorks Story







Dr. Jill Murphy was very happy with the first decade of her career, having had an opportunity to practice as a physical therapist, licensed athletic trainer, and strength and conditioning specialist, and then "retire" to practicing as just a physical therapist in a friendly, hospital out-patient department when the first baby came along.  However, practicing part time without the ability to have a direct impact on changing and improving the care her patients received on a daily basis became a limitation.  Faced with the decision to continue with the status quo or move up into middle management and no longer treat patients hands-on, Dr. Murphy had to find another option that allowed for continuous improvement of the patient experience while still treating patients on a daily basis.While treating for ten years in several hospital systems' out-patient physical therapy departments, Dr. Murphy recognized that physical therapists could offer so much more to patients if not restrained by bureaucratic red tape that serves as a barrier to change in larger insitutions.  Things like being open early to treat patients at a time that won't make them late to work or force patients to use vacation time or lunch time to attend physical therapy.  Private treatment rooms and comforts like dimmer switches in rooms where patients are lying on their back staring into bright lights when being treated for things like migraines and chronic pain.  Care provided by one physical therapist for the whole visit and throughout the continuum of care, without pressure to hand off patients to other providers with less training and experience.  And what if a patient couldn't make it to the clinic on a weekday but needed to be seen?  What if the patient experience could be enhanced, with spa-like surroundings, relaxing music selected by the patient, and a play area too keep kids occupied if needed during mom or dad's visit?Better yet, what if the general public could learn more about what physical therapists have to offer?  What if moms knew that physical therapy could help eradicate daily headaches they have been suffering with for years? What if the general public knew that physical therapists provide a complete treatment plan for low back pain and neck pain, providing symptomatic relief and long-term solutions with manual therapy AND stabilization exercises and prescriptive exercises designed to correct movement dysfunction to get rid of pain and keep it from coming back?  What if people knew that physical therapits can treat TMJ dysfunction, balance issues, and vertigo, offering quick symptom relief and long term solutions?  What if a physical therapy clinic could offer an urgent headache care clinic to give patients with headaches and migraines a valid alternative to the "administer drugs and get patients out before the headache returns" approach of emergency rooms?So many little things, little changes, that could make physical therapy more available, accessible, and comfortable for patients - changes that just could not get done in larger physical therapy institutions - are what drove Dr. Murphy to create a new pardigm for physical therapy.  In a small, physical therapist owned private out-patient physical therapy practice, Dr. Murphy was able to improve access to care with initial appointments in 24 hours, enable marketing of unique services direct to consumers, and provide physical therapy in a comfortable environment specifically designed to promote healing- all while ensuring that every patient received the highest quality physical therapy services available in the Fox Valley.  At the same time, she also made many job shadowing and physical therapy student internships available for students wishing to learn more about the sports medicine and physical therapy profession.  Dr. Murphy's philosophy in business is to ask "Why not?" or "Why can't we?" instead of finding excuses for not improving patient care. Recognizing that pursuing excellence in care is an on-going endeavor, MotionWorks Physical Therapy is open to change and making continuous improvements to continue meeting our patients' highest expectations for their physical therapy care.Five years later, the Fox Valley community has discovered the unique, patient-centered physical therapy services that MotionWorks has to offer, recommending MotionWorks to friends and family, neighbors and co-workers, making MotionWorks Physical Therapy a resounding success. MotionWorks Physical Therapy patients love their physical therapy care and look forward to physical therapy visits, knowing they are trusting their care to the right hands and being treated in the right place.  Our physical therapists work every day to live up to these high expectations of individualized patient care and tailored treatments that go well beyond a simple protocol, making Dr. Murphy's idealistic dream of what physical therapy could be a workable reality right here in Neenah.  Thank you to our patients for entrusting us with the physical therapy needs for themselves and their families, and to the physicians who have discovered our high quality, personalized approach to patient care and and refer their patients, friends, and family for our unique physical therapy services.

Physical Therapy in Motion Inc is owned and directed by licensed physical therapist Coy Leverette III. Graduating with a BS in Microbiology from Howard University in 1989, Coy went on to graduate Magna Cum Laude with a BS in Health Science, and also earned a MS degree in Physical Therapy, both in 1999, again from Howard University.
"When I started my career in physical therapy, my aim was to help people improve their lives through correction of movement dysfunction... I find physical therapy's unique combination of science, art, and the hands-on nature of the profession compelling and most advantageous for the patient. I imagine each physical problem as a puzzle. And I believe it's important to engage my patients, their families, and doctors in solving that puzzle with me."
Coy is currently licensed in Georgia where he continues to practice as well as further his education. He has currently earned certifications in Peripheral Joint Mobilization, the Shoulder Complex, Successful Evaluation and Treatment of Low Back Pain, Manual Physical Therapy, and Anatomy and Biomechanics of the Foot and Ankle.
Coy LOVES his work, and his patients love Coy, as these testimonials will show.

Welcome to Motion Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Our innovative BalanceWear® technology is indicated for patients with mobility difficulties associated with loss of postural control and loss of balance. 
After 10 years of research, this non-invasive, torso-stabilizing therapy is now available. We developed BalanceWear® to help patients suffering losses of postural control, alignment or balance, which could be a side effect of a wide variety of neurologic and orthopedic disorders including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, Ataxia, Stroke, spinal disc dysfunction, and more.

About Motion Therapeutics
MTI provides innovative, non-invasive wearable postural control and stabilizing products for individuals with mobility and balance issues.  
The company's patented BalanceWear® series of Truncal Orthosis vests and patented Balance-Based Torso-Weighting Methodology (BBTW®) was developed to provide help to patients with a variety of mobility disorders including balance problems.
Many older individuals and those persons with neurological conditions may have a loss of postural control and compromised balance as a symptom of a medical condition. BalanceWear is indicated for such conditions.
NOTE:  BalanceWear is not a medical treatment for any disease and MTI does not represent that BalanceWear is a cure for any disease.
