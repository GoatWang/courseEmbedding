Gary Cantrell, Barkley Marathon Race Director
“Unforgiving.” That is one word used to describe The Barkley Marathon, it’s considered hands down the world’s toughest trail race. Since 1986 only 9 people have finished it. Leaving a wake of empty Gu packets, bloody socks and unrealized goals, we talk with the Barkley Marathon’s race director. We’ll talk about it’s history, the few that conquered it, the many it destroyed and why people line up at it’s start line every single year.

I am a young-ish inde filmmaker in Los Angeles.  I am interested in doing a documentary on The Barkley Marathons.  I read your work in The Believer (THE IMMORTAL HORIZON.) Without breaking a contract or trust is it possible to get contact information for an organizer of the race?  (Gary?)
Thank you

Worst beating I ever had took 96 consecutive hours. Was working on a jet engine that was to idle at 6800rpms but it would only come up to 5900 and hang right there. No matter what I did it would only do 5900rpms. My boss came up to me on my last attempt and asked me if I had it yet. Looking at him I broke into tears, dropped to my knees and cried like a baby saying I have never had a piece of metal beat me like this. Four days with no sleep, heaven knows how much coffee I had drunk or cigarettes smoked I was humbled. I do not believe the Barkley can make me feel any worse but I would like to try. If anybody knows how to get an invite please let me know.

Hi Wendy! So sorry I’m just getting to this. I have no idea where the podcast went. Very strange. Working on it, and I’ll let everyone know when it’s back up.
It was crazy hard getting hold of Laz in the first place, this only adds to the amusement.

I have a question for Lazarus Lake. I read a short article about the Barkley race and the Meth Lab Hill caught my attention. I’m not familiar with meth labs, especially au naturel ones, so I was wondering how much equipment the proprietors had to lug in and through what kind of terrain and what distance they had to travel. I imagine they had to do make the trip on a regular basis. It’s amazing what people will do when there’s real money at stake.

Gary Cantrell - Jabil - Insightive     IT LeadershipGary Cantrell speaks about digital innovation at Jabil January 17, 2017 by insightive.tv“IOT is one of those areas where I think there is a lot of hype, but I also think there is a lot of opportunities. We need to figure out where there is value for our customers. I think IT is in a great place, not only to find solutions for that but to provide ideas for the business about how we can go develop these opportunities into new business models.” Insightive.tv: Do you think IT is seen as an enabler or necessary cost — has there has been a change in this perspective recently? Gary: Over the last few years, I think the perspective has rapidly changed from cost to key enabler. Jabil has definitely undergone this transition. My boss, our COO, has developed an insatiable appetite for the transformation power the IT team can bring. The goal has really become to take a broad and strategic approach.The development and availability of technology has had an impact. But, as much as anything else, I think the change has come from an attitude shift within the IT team itself. We made a purposeful pivot to look at the new technologies and work with the business to figure out how to best leverage those technologies in innovative ways. It was the combination of realising the opportunities in the digital space and opening up a dialogue with the business leaders that has allowed us to have success. This has created a much more value based and strategic set of priorities than existed even a few years ago. Insightive.tv: What are some of the recent developments you have been working on? Gary: One large project involved working with our supply chain leaders to develop an intelligent digital supply chain. We have also done quite a bit around analytics within the production line and within our production facilities.We started working to implement digital analytics about two years ago — beginning with some specific tools like Microsoft Azure. We implemented these technologies within the product line to analyse how to improve our product quality. This also enabled us to run algorithms on production parts to predict failures before they showed up in the inspection processes. We can then look at all this information and improve some of our other operations. Things like machine maintenance operate on prescribed cycles, which, frankly, may or may not be optimal for what we are doing. So we are using analytics to improve those processes, and we are seeing some early success.To help cultivate the skills needed to engage in a digital culture we recently started our Citizen Data Scientist Program. This is a training program that takes internal subject matter experts through a curriculum on how to use analytical tools. Insightive.tv: If you look to the future, what are your plans in terms of transformation — what are your dream transformation projects? Gary: In our digital program we have three guiding principles. First, our digital efforts need to improve our customer experience. Second, we must focus on improving our operations. The third element is about using digital strategies to identify new business opportunities. Looking forward, it is that third aspect where I want to see IT get even more aggressive with our business partners in identifying and developing opportunities that can take technology and transform our business from a digital standpoint.IOT is one of those areas where I think there is a lot of hype, but I also think there is a lot of opportunities. We need to figure out where there is value for our customers. I think IT is in a great place, not only to find solutions for that but to provide ideas for the business about how we can go develop these opportunities into new business models.That is my long-term view. But this is challenging. We have to get the mindset right within the IT organisation to take that step of being business people — as opposed to just IT people. This creates a second challenge  —  developing business models requires a different skill set than we have had historically. We have had to go on a fairly aggressive talent development process over the last few years to bring in some of the new talents that have helped us make that transition.The other important piece of context that has to be taken into account during implementation is that we have to continue to take care of our operations while undertaking transformation projects. We are working very quickly on transforming to cloud infrastructure. That will allow us to reskill part of our IT force to start thinking about where we can provide new business opportunities, away from what we do on the operations side. That is where I get excited. Insightive.tv: In terms of the workforce, are you doing anything to increase manufacturing and production productivity? Gary: In the physical manufacturing of the products there are a number of initiatives we have where we are partnering with the operations teams. You get a lot of dialogue about IT/OT. Jabil is probably right in the middle of that pack in regards to having a lot of IT and OT. Over the last eighteen months, we have made some really good strides partnering with the operational teams to make both technical and strategic improvements to the shop floor.Part of that is a new MES systems that we are rolling out. This gives us better visibility and flexibility to tailor that system to what is needed. There has been a lot of work done around analytics and visibility on the shop floor, which is helping drive productivity. We have had a lot of success using analytics to improve the quality of our products and to catch early defects as items go through the assembly line.We are able to look at a lot of this information in real time. It varies a little by site, but what we are focusing on right now is taking the analytics work from the shop floor and figuring out where we can increase value. Insightive.tv: How do your transformation projects link into the supply chain — how big of a role do you see there in the future? Gary: We partner with our global supply chain and work a lot with them on their enablement. This relationship has actually kind of turned a corner in the last eight or nine months to where the supply chain partners are now asking us to take a look at the embedded capabilities in the systems we have and work with them on identifying opportunities to improve their processes. From that perspective, we work with them pretty tightly and I only see that improving in the future.We have to convince our IT guys to spend more time down on the shop floor, and with the supply chain leaders themselves. We have to understand these processes to be able to improve the capabilities and tools. This, again, is a challenge when we ask our guys to do this on top of their day job.Historically, IT has been a little bit of a response organisation, versus an organisation that pushes its ideas and advertises opportunities. Moving away from this is the big shift we are undertaking in all areas of the business. I see this developing in the future — it is the key to adding value.

Modern Wicca is a vibrant, uplifting nature religion practiced by hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone. But wearing "witchy" jewelry and casting a few spells does not make one a witch, for Wicca is a lifestyle and those who walk its path have solemnly dedicated themselves to the service of the Goddess and God. 

Wiccan Beliefs and Practices was written for the solitary witch or non-traditional small coven. Written by a Wiccan High Priest and retired aerospace engineer, Wiccan Beliefs & Practices includes crucial information not found in other introductory Wiccan books, including: 

 Ethics of a Witch, including the Code of Chivalry 
 How to write and develop your own spells and rituals; 
 The physically-challenged Witch
 Out of the broom closet: is it right for you?
 Know your rights: the legal protection of Wicca as a
    legitimate religion

Author Gary Cantrell speaks from personal experience with Wiccans of all ages and degrees of physical ability, bringing you an earnest examination of modern Wiccan beliefs and a practical guide to the Craft of the Wise.

In the following excerpt, the author explains why he chose to "come out of the broom closet." 

I elected to reveal my practice of witchcraft publicly simply because I personally feel that the time for intentionally hiding ourselves has come to an end. We are practitioners of a kind, gentle, and peace-loving religion. We are not the bloodthirsty or depraved, orgiastic fanatics all too often portrayed by the entertainment and news media. The general public has been misled about witchcraft for over a thousand years, and now with our numbers reaching an all-time high, possibly in excess of one million people worldwide, we need to stand up and set that record straight.

We are out there by the hundreds upon hundreds of thousands. We are in the arts, the sciences, and the humanities. We are law enforcement officers, engineers, builders, doctors, and farmers. We are a legally recognized religion under the protection of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and our isolation from the rest of the religious community should and must come to an end. With the phenomenal growth of witchcraft since the 1970s and with the free and easy interchange of information afforded to us by things like the Internet, that time will come to pass and it will happen soon. It may be happening now.

Spirits and witches go together like sunlight and solar panels.
