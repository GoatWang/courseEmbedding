(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   First Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016 (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2017 Fourth Quarter 2016 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,618 $ 281 $ 1,676 $ 319 Drilling 1,985 229 2,013 234 Production 2,187 110 2,203 128 Cameron 1,229 162 1,346 188 Eliminations & other (125 ) (25 ) (131 ) (59 ) Pretax operating income 757 810 Corporate & other (1) (239 ) (245 ) Interest income (2) 24 23 Interest expense (3) (126 ) (126 ) Charges and credits (4) (82 ) (675 ) $ 6,894 $ 334 $ 7,107 $ (213 )  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($5 million in 2017; $7 million in 2016).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($13 million in 2017; $13 million in 2016).  (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Reservoir Characterization Group  Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 3% sequentially primarily due to project completions in Testing & Process systems and lower SIS software license sales. These decreases were partly offset by Wireline revenue growth as a result of infrastructure-led exploration activity in North America.  Pretax operating margin of 17% decreased 170 basis points (bps) sequentially as the increased contribution from high-margin Wireline exploration activities was more than offset by reduced profitability in WesternGeco and lower contributions from SIS software license sales.  Drilling Group  Drilling Group revenue of $2.0 billion decreased 1% sequentially as strong directional drilling activity in North America land was more than offset by lower drilling activity and pricing pressure in the International Areas.  Pretax operating margin of 12% was essentially flat sequentially despite the slight revenue decline. This was due to pricing improvements in the US offset by pricing pressure in the international markets.  Production Group  Production Group revenue of $2.2 billion was 1% lower sequentially primarily due to a combination of decreased revenue on SPM projects in Ecuador, reduced hydraulic fracturing activity on land in the Middle East and lower Completions product sales. These decreases were partially mitigated by strong hydraulic fracturing activity and pricing recovery that led to a 19% growth in revenue in North America land.  Pretax operating margin of 5% decreased 78 bps sequentially as the positive effects of increased activity and pricing recovery on land in North America were more than offset by margin contraction from lower SPM revenue.  Cameron Group  Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9% sequentially driven by declining project volumes in OneSubsea and reduced product sales in Surface Systems. The revenue decline for OneSubsea was due to falling project volumes in Brazil and reduced activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. Surface Systems sales were lower in the Europe/CIS/Africa and Latin America Areas, which more than offset the double-digit revenue growth in North America land.  Pretax operating margin of 13% declined 80 bps sequentially as continued strong project execution in OneSubsea and tight cost control in Drilling Systems limited the impact of lower product volume in Surface Systems.   First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016 (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2017 First Quarter 2016 Income Income Before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,618 $ 281 $ 1,719 $ 334 Drilling 1,985 229 2,493 371 Production 2,187 110 2,376 206 Cameron 1,229 162 - - Eliminations & other (125 ) (25 ) (68 ) (10 ) Pretax operating income 757 901 Corporate & other (1) (239 ) (172 ) Interest income (2) 24 13 Interest expense (3) (126 ) (120 ) Charges and credits (4) (82 ) - $ 6,894 $ 334 $ 6,520 $ 622  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items. The first quarter of 2017 includes $63 million of intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the April 2016 acquisition of Cameron.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($5 million in 2017; $6 million in 2016).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($13 million in 2017; $13 million in 2016).  (4) Charges and credits recorded are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  First-quarter 2017 revenue of $6.9 billion increased 6% year-on-year. This included a full quarter of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses, which contributed revenue of $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of the Cameron acquisition, revenue declined 13% year-on-year. During the first-quarter of 2017 the North America land rig count returned to prior year levels. However, the international land rig count was lower by 8%, the North America offshore rig count was lower by 25%, and the International offshore rig count was lower by 18%. As a result, Drilling Group revenue decreased 20% while Production Group and Reservoir Characterization Group were lower by 8% and 6%, respectively. In addition to the impact of the rig count, revenue also declined year-on-year as a result of reduced activity levels in Venezuela following Schlumberger's decision in April 2016 to align activity with cash collections.  First-quarter 2017 pretax operating margin decreased 284 bps to 11%, as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing pressure internationally. The margin decrease was the highest in the Production Group, which contracted by 365 bps to 5%. Drilling Group pretax operating margin fell 334 bps to 12%, while the Reservoir Characterization Group decreased 206 bps to 17%, and the Cameron Group posted a pretax margin of 13%.  Reservoir Characterization Group  First-quarter 2017 revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-on-year primarily due to lower exploration and reduced discretionary spending by customers in the offshore markets which impacted Wireline and SIS software license sales as well as reduced activity in Venezuela. These decreases were partly offset by higher revenue from increased land seismic and multiclient activity in WesternGeco and increased revenue in Testing & Process relating to progress on early production facilities in the Middle East & Asia Area.  Year-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 206 bps to 17% due to reduced higher-margin Wireline activities partly offset by improved profitability in WesternGeco.  Drilling Group  First-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.0 billion decreased 20% year-on-year primarily due to the decline in the international and offshore North America rig counts and lower activity in Venezuela combined with pricing pressure.  Year-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 334 bps to 12% primarily due to a decline in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements combined with the impact of pricing pressure.  Production Group  First-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 8% year-on-year due primarily to the decline in international activity as well as decreased revenue on SPM projects in Ecuador. These decreases were partially offset by increased hydraulic fracturing activity in North America land.  Year-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 365 bps to 5% as a result of lower international activity and increased pricing pressure.  Cameron Group  On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cameron, a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. Schlumberger issued approximately 138 million shares of its common stock, which were valued at $9.9 billion at the time of closing, and paid cash of $2.8 billion. Prior to being acquired by Schlumberger, Cameron reported revenue of approximately $1.6 billion during the first quarter of 2016.  Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) First Quarter 2017 2016 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies $ 17 $ 25 Interest income 29 20 $ 46 $ 45  The decrease in earnings of equity method investments primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry, which has negatively impacted the majority of Schlumberger's investments in affiliates, particularly those in North America.  Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: First Quarter 2017 2016 Research & engineering 3.1 % 3.7 % General & administrative 1.4 % 1.7 %  Research & engineering and General & administrative costs have decreased $29 million and $12 million, respectively, as a result of cost control measures, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition.  The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 15% compared to 16% for the same period of the prior year. The charges described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements reduced the first-quarter 2017 effective tax rate by 0.4 percentage points. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016.  Charges and Credits  In connection with Schlumberger's acquisition of Cameron (See Note 4 - Acquisition of Cameron), Schlumberger recorded $82 million of pretax charges ($68 million after-tax) consisting of employee benefits, facility consolidation, and other merger and integration-related costs during the first quarter of 2017. This charge is classified in Merger & integration in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Second Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2017 (Stated in millions) Second Quarter 2017 First Quarter 2017 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,759 $ 299 $ 1,618 $ 281 Drilling 2,107 302 1,985 229 Production 2,496 221 2,187 110 Cameron 1,265 174 1,229 162 Eliminations & other (165 ) (46 ) (125 ) (25 ) Pretax operating income 950 757 Corporate & other (1) (242 ) (239 ) Interest income (2) 28 24 Interest expense (3) (128 ) (126 ) Charges and credits (4) (591 ) (82 ) $ 7,462 $ 17 $ 6,894 $ 334  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in the second quarter of 2017; $5 million in the first quarter of 2017).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($14 million in the second quarter of 2017; $13 million in the first quarter of 2017).  (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Reservoir Characterization Group  Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% sequentially primarily due to higher WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales in the international markets. Increased Testing & Process activity in the international markets and seasonal improvements in Wireline in Russia also contributed to the increase.  Pretax operating margin of 17% was essentially flat sequentially as the increased contribution from high-margin Wireline exploration activities was offset by reduced profitability in Testing & Process due to increased project costs.  Drilling Group  Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased 6% sequentially primarily due to the seasonal rebound in activity in the Russia & CIS and North Sea regions and strong directional drilling activity in US land.  Pretax operating margin of 14% increased 278 basis points (bps) sequentially due to increased volume and pricing improvements in US land.  Production Group  Production Group revenue of $2.5 billion was 14% higher sequentially as a result of strong hydraulic fracturing activity and a sustained pricing recovery in North America.  Pretax operating margin of 9% increased 382 bps sequentially due to the increased activity and pricing recovery on land in North America.  Cameron Group  Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially driven by higher Surface Systems and Valves & Measurement activity in US land.  Pretax operating margin of 14% improved 61 bps sequentially as increased project volumes and product sales in Surface Systems and Valves & Measurement and continued strong project execution in OneSubsea more than offset the impact of lower project activity in Drilling Systems.   Second Quarter 2017 Compared to Second Quarter 2016 (Stated in millions) Second Quarter 2017 Second Quarter 2016 Income Income Before Before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 1,759 $ 299 $ 1,586 $ 268 Drilling 2,107 302 2,034 171 Production 2,496 221 2,121 82 Cameron 1,265 174 1,525 250 Eliminations & other (165 ) (46 ) (102 ) (24 ) Pretax operating income 950 747 Corporate & other (1) (242 ) (241 ) Interest income (2) 28 24 Interest expense (3) (128 ) (136 ) Charges and credits (4) (591 ) (2,908 ) $ 7,462 $ 17 $ 7,164 $ (2,514 )  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($6 million in 2017; $6 million in 2016).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($14 million in 2017; $13 million in 2016).  (4) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $7.5 billion increased 4% year-on-year. North America land rig count increased more than 150% versus the same period last year while the international land rig count was flat. The North America offshore rig count decreased by 26%, and the international offshore rig count was lower by 12%. Driven by the accelerated land activity growth in North America, Production Group revenue increased 18% year-on-year while Reservoir Characterization Group revenue was 11% higher driven by increases in WesternGeco and Testing & Process. Drilling Group revenue increased by 4% while Cameron Group revenue declined 17%.  Second-quarter 2017 pretax operating margin increased 231 bps to 13%, as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups. As a result, Production Group pretax operating margin expanded 499 bps to 9% while Drilling Group increased 594 bps to 14%. Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 17% and the Cameron Group declined 260 bps to 14%.  Reservoir Characterization Group  Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $1.8 billion increased 11% year-on-year primarily due to higher WesternGeco and Testing & Process revenue on projects in the Middle East & Asia Area. Strong WesternGeco multiclient seismic license sales in the international markets also contributed to the increase.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 17% as increased revenue was offset by higher project costs in Testing & Process.  Drilling Group  Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.1 billion increased 4% year-on-year primarily due to higher demand for directional drilling technologies on land in North America.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 594 bps to 14% primarily due to improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing.  Production Group  Second-quarter 2017 revenue of $2.5 billion increased 18% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in North America that benefited the pressure pumping business.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 499 bps to 9% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing.  Cameron Group  Second-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion declined 17% year-on-year, primarily due to a declining backlog for the long-cycle businesses of Drilling Systems and, to a lesser extent, OneSubsea.  Pretax operating margin of 14% declined 260 bps primarily due the decline in high-margin Drilling Systems project volumes.   Six Months 2017 Compared to Six Months 2016 (Stated in millions) Six Months 2017 Six Months 2016 Income Income Before before Revenue Taxes Revenue Taxes Reservoir Characterization $ 3,377 $ 580 $ 3,305 $ 601 Drilling 4,092 531 4,527 542 Production 4,683 331 4,497 288 Cameron 2,494 336 1,525 250 Eliminations & other (290 ) (71 ) (170 ) (33 ) Pretax operating income 1,707 1,648 Corporate & other (1) (480 ) (414 ) Interest income (2) 52 37 Interest expense (3) (254 ) (256 ) Charges and credits (4) (674 ) (2,908 ) $ 14,356 $ 351 $ 13,684 $ (1,893 )  (1) Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  (2) Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($11 million in 2017; $12 million in 2016).  (3) Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments' income ($27 million in 2017; $26 million in 2016).  (4) Charges and credits recorded are described in detail in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain prior period items have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Six-month 2017 revenue of $14.4 billion increased 5% year-on-year. This included a full six months of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses versus one quarter of activity for the same period in 2016. Excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2017 declined 4% year-on-year.  Six-month revenue for the Drilling Group declined 10%, primarily driven by the 9% decline in the international rig count combined with Schlumberger's decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela in order to align operations with cash collections.  These decreases were slightly mitigated by higher activity in US Land. Production Group revenue increased 4% as accelerated North America land activity growth benefited the pressure pumping business. Reservoir Characterization Group revenue improved 2%.  Six-month 2017 pretax operating margin increased 168 bps to 12%, as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity growth that benefited the Production and Drilling Groups. As a result, Drilling Group pretax operating margin expanded 101 bps to 13% while the Production Group increased 66 bps to 7%. Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin declined 102 bps to 17% and the Cameron Group recorded a pretax operating margin of 13%.  Reservoir Characterization Group  Six-month 2017 revenue of $3.4 billion increased 2% year-on-year primarily due to higher WesternGeco and Testing & Process revenue on projects in the Middle East & Asia Area.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 102 bps to 17% due to reduced profitability in Testing & Process as project costs increased.  Drilling Group  Six-month 2017 revenue of $4.1 billion decreased 10% year-on-year primarily due to the drop in rig counts internationally and in offshore North America combined with pricing pressure. Revenue also declined as a result of Schlumberger's decision in April 2016 to reduce its activities in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 101 bps to 13% primarily due to improved profitability in North America land due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing; however this improvement in North America was partially offset by pricing pressure and activity declines internationally and the negative impact of reduced activity in Venezuela.  Production Group  Six-month 2017 revenue of $4.7 billion increased 4% year-on-year with most of the revenue increase attributable to the accelerated land activity growth in North America that benefited the pressure pumping product lines, which grew 15%. Lower production levels in Ecuador negatively impacted Schlumberger Production Management projects, which partially offset the revenue increase.  Year-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 66 bps to 7% as a result of improved profitability in North America due to accelerated land activity and improved pricing. This was offset by lower profitability in Schlumberger Production Management projects due to lower production in Ecuador.  Cameron Group  Cameron Group contributed six-month 2017 revenue of $2.5 billion. Cameron Group revenue for the six months of 2016 only reflected only one quarter of revenue following the acquisition closing in April 2016. Revenue in 2017 was impacted by a declining project backlog particularly for the long-cycle businesses of Drilling Systems and OneSubsea .  Year-on-year pretax operating margin of 13% was 260 bps lower as a result of lower Drilling Systems project volumes.  Interest and Other Income Interest & other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) Second Quarter Six months 2017 2016 2017 2016 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies $ 28 $ 24 $ 45 $ 49 Interest income 34 30 63 49 $ 62 $ 54 $ 108 $ 98  Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue, for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Second Quarter Six Months 2017 2016 2017 2016 Research & engineering 2.6 % 3.6 % 2.8 % 3.6 % General & administrative 1.5 % 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.6 %  Research & engineering costs for the second quarter of 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017 have decreased as compared to the same periods in 2016 by $61 million and $91 million, respectively, as a result of cost control measures, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition.  The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 590% as compared to 14.6% for the same period of 2016. The charges described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements increased the effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 by 571 percentage points, as the majority of these charges were not tax-effective. Excluding the impact of these charges, the effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of the change in the geographic mix of earnings as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period last year.  The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 42.1% as compared to 14.2% for the same period of 2016. The charges described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements increased the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 by 24.7 percentage points, as the majority of these charges were not tax-effective. Excluding the impact of these charges, the effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of the change in the geographic mix of earnings as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings in North America during the first six months of 2017 as compared to the same period last year.  Charges and Credits  Schlumberger recorded charges during the first and second quarters of 2017 which are fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a summary of the charges recorded during the first six months of 2017:  (Stated in millions)   Noncontrolling Pretax Tax Interests Net Promissory note fair value adjustment and other $ 510 $ - $ 12 $ 498 Merger & integration 164 31 - 133 $ 674 $ 31 $ 12 $ 631  During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger recorded $2.573 billion of asset impairment and workforce reduction charges and $335 million of charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron. These charges, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  (Stated in millions)   Pretax Tax Net Impairments & other Workforce reduction $ 646 $ 63 $ 583 North America pressure pumping asset impairments 209 67 142 Facilities impairments 165 58 107 Other fixed asset impairments 684 52 632 Inventory write-downs 616 49 567 Multiclient seismic data impairment 198 62 136 Other restructuring charges 55 - 55 Merger & integration Merger-related employee benefits 47 7 40 Professional fees 45 10 35 Facility closure costs 40 10 30 Other merger and integration-related 53 9 44 Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment 150 45 105 $ 2,908 $ 432 $ 2,476  There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Details of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow:  (Stated in millions)   Jun. 30, Jun. 30, Dec. 31, Components of Liquidity 2017 2016 2016 Cash $ 1,903 $ 2,947 $ 2,929 Short-term investments 4,315 8,245 6,328 Fixed income investments, held to maturity 13 386 238 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (2,224 ) (3,371 ) (3,153 ) Long-term debt (16,600 ) (18,252 ) (16,463 ) Net debt (1) $ (12,593 ) $ (10,045 ) $ (10,121 )  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Changes in Liquidity: Six Months Ended Jun. 30, 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 203 $ (1,623 ) Impairments and other charges 674 2,908 Depreciation and amortization (2) 1,975 2,080 Earnings of equity method investments, less dividends received (30 ) (30 ) Pension and other postretirement benefits expense 52 92 Stock-based compensation expense 180 145 Pension and other postretirement benefits funding (74 ) (83 ) Increase in working capital (3) (1,339 ) (250 ) Other (127 ) (397 ) Cash flow from operations 1,514 2,842 Capital expenditures (884 ) (998 ) SPM investments (328 ) (729 ) Multiclient seismic data costs capitalized (190 ) (333 ) Free cash flow (4) 112 782 Dividends paid (1,393 ) (1,255 ) Proceeds from employee stock plans 143 195 Stock repurchase program (770 ) (506 ) (1,908 ) (784 ) Business acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed (364 ) (3,790 ) Other (200 ) 76 Increase in net debt (2,472 ) (4,498 ) Net debt, beginning of period (10,121 ) (5,547 ) Net debt, end of period $ (12,593 ) $ (10,045 )  (1) "Net debt" represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.  (2) Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and SPM investments.  (3) Includes severance payments of approximately $230 million and $545 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  (4) "Free cash flow" represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.  Key liquidity events during the first six months of 2017 and 2016 included:   On July 18, 2013, the Schlumberger Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018. This program was completed during May 2017. On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock. Schlumberger had repurchased $1.8 million of shares under the new program as of June 30, 2017.  The following table summarizes the activity under these share repurchase programs:  (Stated in millions, except per share amounts)   Total cost Total number Average price of shares of shares paid per purchased purchased share Six months ended June 30, 2017 $ 770 10.2 $ 75.40 Six months ended June 30, 2016 $ 506 7.5 $ 67.65  Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Schlumberger does not believe that these estimates are reasonably likely to materially change in the foreseeable future, however, adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger's customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments.  In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it would reduce its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters. As of June 30, 2017 Schlumberger's net accounts receivable balance in Venezuela was approximately $0.5 billion, which excludes the $0.2 billion carrying value of the promissory notes described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Schlumberger continues to experience payment delays from certain other customers . . .  Jul 26, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

History[edit]




This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices






Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas


Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region in France as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction[11] and carbon capture and storage industries.[12]
The brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929, in Kern County, California. In 1935, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline & Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.[citation needed]
Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[13] That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry & Hutchinson in 1971.[14] Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.
Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould.[15]
The SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired in 1984, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.[citation needed]
In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.[16] In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.[citation needed]
Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems in 1992. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and www capability. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable & Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of Schlumberger's internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.[citation needed]
In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt.[17]
In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.[citation needed]
In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but Schlumberger's venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which later sold it to Credence.[citation needed]
In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched. Based in Paris, it is the company's management consultancy arm. [18]
In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic,[19][unreliable source?] which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.[20]
In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion.[21] Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.[22]
In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal is the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history.[23] The merger was completed on August 27, 2010.[24] Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.[25]
In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.[26]
In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.[27]
Due to a downturn in the global oil & gas industry in 2015, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of their total workforce.[28]
In August 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.[29]
Schlumberger is the global leader in Hydraulic Fracturing patents, as of 2017.[30]
Corporate affairs[edit]
France[edit]
Its Paris offices are in Le Palatin 1 in the La Défense business district and in Puteaux, France, near Paris.[31][32]
United States[edit]
Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13 ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of Class A office space and an "amenities" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300 m2) of space.[33]
In the 1930s the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company's top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006 the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.[34]
Schlumberger moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.[35][36][37]
Environmental record[edit]
In 2009, Newsweek released their "Green Rankings" [38] a ranking of the 500 largest corporations on track records on a number of environmental issues. Schlumberger was ranked 118th out of 500 overall, and 3rd out of 31 in their industry. Newsweek remarked that to mitigate global warming Schlumberger has invested in carbon sequestration which involves long-term storage of CO2 and that the company's seismic survey ships are 20% to 25% more fuel-efficient than those of other seismic contractors from using fuels that emit less pollution and towing equipment that creates less drag on the vessels.[39]
Radioactive Sources[edit]
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert.[40] The canister had been lost in by the company's transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.[41]
In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.[42]
Spills[edit]
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake's Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.[43]
Brownfields[edit]
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.[44]
Deepwater Horizon[edit]
Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. However, the wireline log was cancelled and the Schlumberger standby crew was released by BP and left the rig earlier on the same day of the Deepwater Horizon explosion.[45]

Warning on Recruitment Fraud


Beware – recruitment scams on the increase!
Fraudsters pretending to represent Schlumberger are sending e-mails, letters and texts offering employment to prospective employees. These offers often look legitimate and include job description, salary, and benefit details.
These fraudsters then ask for payment to obtain visas or to process immigration documents.
We never ask for payment to process documents, we never refer you to a third party to process applications or visas, and we never ask you to pay costs.
Never send money or pass on personal details to anyone suggesting they can provide employment with Schlumberger, and never reply to an email address that does not end in @slb.com.
