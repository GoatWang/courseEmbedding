Michael  Steinbach's Experience
Title: President
               Company: Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America
Job Details
               The International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB) is a federation composed of the national associations for professional dealers in antiquarian, rare, out of print, and used books, prints, maps, autographs and manuscripts, and related written and printed materials. It has 20 member associations with almost 2000 booksellers from 30 countries on five continents. It was founded in 1947. It is probably fair to say that the majority of the world's best professional antiquarian booksellers are ILAB affiliates. In the ILAB, the 20 national associations function independently, each with their own set of rules for joining. However, all ILAB booksellers subscribe to a common written code of ethics and standards of professionalism. Generally, a national association will require a bookseller to have worked full time for a given number of years and will in many cases require sponsorship by current members. There are annual dues and fees which vary by country. A bookseller must join the ILAB national association in the country where his business resides in order to become affiliated with ILAB. If your country has no ILAB association, a few associations (Australia / New Zealand, Denmark, France, Great Britain & the United States) accept members from outside their countries. Many ILAB associations offer benefits, besides the prestige of being a part of the world's premier antiquarian booksellers' federation, such as favourable insurance rates, freight rates, valuable professional advice, etc. ­ not to mention lifelong friendships. The ILAB website also contains a stolen books database that is available to ILAB booksellers and selected libraries and law enforcement agencies, but not to the general public. Please click here to see a list of ILAB associations and to contact the appropriate one to inquire about joining. Once you have been accepted by an ILAB national association, you become eligible to list your books on the www.ILAB.org database. There is a one-time set up fee and a monthly subscription, but there are NO COMMISSIONS ON SALES. This is a smaller database (over 500 members by April, 2006, and 4.5 million books). You will find no "junk" listings there. Prices range from $5.00 to six figures. Given the situation online with the larger established databases, www.ILAB.org grows daily as the choice of the serious book collector or just the general buyer who wants the guarantees that go with buying from reliable accredited sellers.

Mr. Steinbach possesses an extensive understanding of the semi-tractor and trailer industry acquired from his experience in the equipment sales business. His depth of knowledge of our primary equipment (semi-tractors and trailers) is a valuable resource to the Company as we assess the age, productivity and other characteristics of our tractor and trailer fleet. This knowledge, coupled with Mr. Steinbach's related comprehension of the truckload transportation industry and successful personal business experience, contribute to our Board's collective qualifications, skills and experience.
