(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This section of this report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward looking statements are often identified by words like:  Overview  VGambling Inc., ("VGambling", "the Company", "our" or "we") was incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008. VGambling is a development-stage online gambling company and plans to offer wagering on eSports events and the ability to participate in video game tournaments for real-money in a licensed and secure environment.  The online gambling market represents one of the fastest growing segments of the gambling industry. H2 Gambling Capital, a leading supplier of data and market intelligence on the global gambling industry, estimates the current size of the global online gambling market is in excess of US$40 billion, with forecasts to exceed US$50 billion by 2017. Source: H2 Gambling Capital, Global Online Gambling Report, July 2014.  The eSports market represents the fastest growing sports market in the world.  eSports is the professionalization of video games. Contrary to its name, eSports does not involve video games of traditional sports such as football and basketball. Rather, eSports typically takes the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. The best-known example of an eSports game among non-eSports enthusiasts is Call of Duty. Currently, however, the two most successful eSports games are Dota 2League of Legends (a multiplayer online battle arena game) and Counter Strike: Global Offensive (a first person shooter game). Other popular games include Smite, Starcraft II, Call of Duty� Heroes of the Storm, and Hearthstone. eSports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions such as WII (Nintendo), and Halo (343 Industries).  Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a massive global surge in popularity with the rapid growth of online streaming over the last few years. The advent of online streaming technology has turned eSports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in person in stadiums (which are often sold out), as well as of online viewers which regularly exceed 1,000,000 for major tournaments. The impact has been so significant, that many video game developers now build features into their games designed to facilitate competition.  VGambling intends to offer eSports enthusiasts from around the world, excluding the United States, the ability to wager on a wide variety of e-Sports events. VGambling intends to offer users the opportunity to wager against other users utilizing a peer-to-peer wagering system with no risk to the Company. VGambling plans to generate revenue from fees charged to players based on a percentage of the  amount wagered on an event. VGambling intends to offer spectators the ability to wager on all major professional eSports events and a wide range of amateur eSports events.  VGambling also intends to offer users from around the world, excluding 13 States within the United States, the ability to participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a percentage of tournament entry fees and will not have any of our own capital at risk. VGambling intends to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in both small groups and major tournaments.  VGambling will not offer online users traditional casino style games such as poker, craps or slots, nor will it offer online wagering on traditional sporting events like football or soccer. VGambling will be focused solely on offering online wagering on the widest range of eSports events broadcast from around the world, as well as, hosting online video game tournaments for enthusiasts.  Given the global demand for live eSports events, VGambling also intends to acquire the 62,000 square foot Grand Princess Casino in Antigua, for the purposes of converting it into an eSports Coliseum that will hold a variety of eSports events such as: hosting spectators as they watch live eSports events on the main floor; hosting video game tournaments that provide visitors with the opportunity to participate in tournaments on the second floor,  Our initial plan to launch and operate our business involves two phases.  In the first phase, we intend to complete the development, testing and launching of our eSports focused online gambling website. We estimate that the costs involved in completing the first phase will be approximately $2,000,000. We expect our sales and marketing efforts to begin not less than 90 days prior to the commencement of wagering operations. We intend to develop and launch our online eSports focused wagering website within six months of raising the necessary funds.  In the second phase, we intend to acquire, renovate, equip and operate our land based eSports Coliseum. We estimate the cost of acquiring and refurbishing the Grand Princess Casino in Antigua at approximately $14,000,000. We further estimate the cost of equipping and operating the eSports focused multi-purpose facility at approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000. We intend to acquire, renovate, equip and launch our eSports focused multi-purpose facility in Antigua within six months of raising the necessary funds. We expect our sales and marketing efforts to begin within 180 days of the commencement of operations.  We currently have one full time and four part time employees. If we are able to raise sufficient capital, we plan to hire additional employees by March 1, 2017.  To date, our operations have been limited to technical and market research and organizational activities. We have not begun to design, develop or operate our wagering systems. As of December 31, 2016, we have not generated any revenue from our operations.  Our executive office is located at 1394 Pineway Court, Oakville, ON, Canada.  Online Operations  VGambling intends to offer users from around the world, excluding the United States, the ability to wager on a wide variety of e-Sports events. eSports event gambling involves spectators wagering online on  the outcome of professional and amateur eSporting events. VGambling intends to offer users the opportunity to wager against other users utilizing a peer-to-peer wagering system with minimal risk to the Company. VGambling intends to offer spectators the ability to wager on all major professional eSports events and a wide range of amateur eSports events that will be broadcast live via streaming services including, twitch.tv, azubu.tv, ustream.tv and youtube.com. VGambling currently expects to launch online and mobile versions of eSports event betting under the Coliseum brand beginning in the first half of 2017.  VGambling also intends to offer users from around the world, excluding 13 States within the United States, the ability to enter and participate in online video game tournaments and win cash prizes. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and will not have any of our own capital at risk. VGambling intends to offer users a wide selection of video games of skill to be played online for real money in small groups to major tournaments. Users will be able to enter and participate in tournaments utilizing their PC, game console or mobile device. In video game tournaments, players play against each other in either ring games (i.e., games for cash on a hand-by-hand basis) or in tournaments (i.e., players play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors) or variations thereof. VGambling collects a percentage of each pot (the "rake") in ring games and a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and sit and go tournaments, which do not put any of the Company's own capital at risk. VGambling expects to launch online and mobile versions of tournament play, initially utilizing simple video games and later more complex video games, under the Coliseum brand beginning in the second half of 2017, globally.  VGambling has been issued a Client Provider Authorization Permit from the Kahnawake Gaming Commission in Canada. The computer servers and related equipment required for our eSports gambling business will be located in the data center facilities on the Mohawk of Kahnawake Indian Reservation in Canada. Although this Permit allows VGambling's wholly-owned subsidiary to conduct real-money online gambling and wagering activities on a global basis, VGambling believes that also operating from Antigua, in addition to from the Mohawk Indian Reservation in Canada, is more beneficial for the following reasons:  �  access to experienced staff  �  access to premium office space  �  lower operating costs  Antigua is a "UK white listed" gambling jurisdiction. White listed gambling jurisdictions are those gambling jurisdictions that were allowed to advertise gambling services on-line in the United Kingdom and have more credibility in the online gambling industry.  Accordingly, and depending on its ability to raise additional capital, VGambling intends to submit an Application for Interactive Wagering License to the Financial Services Regulatory Commission of Antigua and Barbuda in the 1st quarter of 2017. If the license is granted, VGambling's wholly-owned subsidiary would also be able to conduct real-money online gambling and wagering activities on a global basis from Antigua.  We have a Betting Gaming Platform Software Agreement with Swiss Interactive Software GmbH, a company controlled by Yan Rozum, one of our directors. Under the Agreement, Swiss Interactive has agreed to grant VGambling an exclusive license to offer certain Swiss Interactive developed eSports event wagering platforms for real money play and wagering. Although the Agreement has been signed, no payment is due until we want to begin the development and customization of the wagering system.  In 2014, we entered into an agreement with CAMS, LLC which provides us with the ability to identify the location of persons wanting to use our system for eSports wagering, and block system for use for persons in the United States and other jurisdictions where online gambling is illegal. The CAMS system also allows us to detect fraud in certain instances.  We have agreements with a number of entities, including Skrill Limited, Paypal Pte Ltd, and Entropay, that allows us to process money transfers through the internet.  On August 25, 2016 we entered into an agreement with Income Access, a technology and digital marketing company serving the global iGaming industry. Under the agreement, VGambling will integrate Income Access' award-winning affiliate management platform and Ad Serving tool to manage the operator's forthcoming affiliate programme.  The Company will control the payments, customer service, marketing and other aspects of its business.  Land Based Operations  In June 2016, the Company made an offer to purchase the Grand Princess Casino, located in Jolly Harbor, Antigua, for $8,000,000 (US$). As of February 15, 2017 the Company's offer had not been accepted. The offer was contingent, among other things, upon the Company being approved for the Citizenship by Investment Program ("CIP") of Antigua and Barbuda.  If the offer is accepted, the Company plans to use the CIP program to finance the purchase price and the cost of refurbishing and renovating (estimated to be $4,750,000) the facility.  The Company will also need approximately $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 to purchase equipment and provide working capital during the start-up phase following its opening. The Company estimates the facility, if and when it begins operations, will have approximately 12 employees and will cost approximately $50,000 per month to operate. If the Company's offer is accepted, and needed capital is raised, the Company estimates the casino will not begin operations until six months after the needed capital is raised.  The CIP program was established following parliamentary assent to the Antigua and Barbuda Citizenship by Investment Regulations (2014). These regulations allow the government to operate a program under which citizenship is granted to those who qualify under criteria set by parliamentary decision. Through this program investors, along with their families, have the opportunity to apply for citizenship in Antigua and obtain a second passport.  Obtaining a passport through the CIP program allows an investor and his family to enjoy a number of benefits conferred by their citizenship. A holder of an Antigua passport can enjoy visa-free travel to over 100 countries including the United Kingdom, Canada and all European Union Schengen countries. In addition to the ability to travel freely, an investor can reside in Antigua for as long as he or she would like.  The CIP program requires a person to make a significant economic contribution to Antigua. In exchange, and subject to application procedures, the applicants and their families are granted citizenship. To qualify for citizenship, the primary applicant must be over 18 years of age, meet the application requirements and select one of the following Six investment options:  �  A contribution to the National Development Fund of a minimum non-refundable amount of US$200,000;  �  An investment of at least US$400,000 into an approved real estate project to be held for at least 5 years;  �  An investment of a minimum of US$1,500,000 directly into an eligible business as sole investor or a joint investment involving at least two persons in an eligible business totalling at least US$5,000,000 and each of those persons individually invests at least US$400,000.  The Company has applied to have the Grand Princess Casino designated as an "approved real estate project". If approved, a person that invests at least $400,000 in an Antigua subsidiary of the Company will qualify the investor and his family for citizenship in Antigua and Barbuda. The amounts invested in the Company's subsidiary will be used to purchase and refurbish the Grand Princess Casino.  For each $1.00 invested, the investor will receive one share of the subsidiary's preferred stock. Each preferred share will pay an annual dividend of $0.08.  Beginning five years and one month after the issuance of the preferred shares, at the option of the holder, each preferred share will be convertible into shares of our common stock. If converted, the number of shares of common stock to be issued will determined by dividing 1 by 80% of the average closing price of our common stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding the date of the conversion.  Beginning five years after the issuance of the preferred shares, each preferred share is redeemable, at our option, in whole or in part, and on one or more occasions, at a price of $1.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.  The Grand Princess Casino will not be operated as a traditional casino. Rather, it will host spectators as they watch live eSports events on the main floor, as well as, provide visitors with the opportunity to participate in video game tournaments on the second floor, all under the eSports Coliseum brand.  A live eSports event normally involves two or more professional teams which are contracted to participate. The sponsor of the event is typically required to pay the transportation and lodging expenses of the participating teams. The quality of teams participating is based on the cash prize offered to the winner.  The Grand Princess Casino consists of 62,000 square feet over three floors and will be rebranded as the eSports Coliseum,  Initially, the first floor of the eSports Coliseum will be used to host events arranged by existing and established eSports tournament organizers. We intend to work with multiple eSports tournament organizers and arrange for them to host one or a series of events at the eSports Coliseum. As a permanent eSports event hosting facility, tournament organizers will benefit from the cost efficiency of not having to ship, assemble and then remove the equipment and services needed to host an eSports event involving multiple teams, 1,500 spectators and broadcasting in a temporary facility. The eSports Coliseum will generate revenue from facilities rental to tournament organizers in the form of a flat fee or as a percentage of ticket sales.  Ultimately, we also intend to organize and host our own eSports events on the first floor of the eSports Coliseum. We intend to negotiate with multiple video game publishers to secure the rights to their game software to enable us to host one or more eSports events at the eSports Coliseum. The cost of the game software licenses are negotiated individually and can be based on a flat fee, as a percentage of the  prize pool, as a percentage of ticket sales, or at no cost. We intend to attract eSports spectator demographic focused sponsors and advertisers to make financial contributes to the event prize pool. We intend to enter into agreements with the eSports teams from around the world to have them participate in our events. The teams will have the opportunity to compete for the prize pool offered. We intend to broadcast globally all eSports events live on multiple video streaming platforms, such as twitch.tv and youtube.com. We intend to market the events primarily through online advertising on eSports focused websites and the websites and social media of professional eSports players and teams. We generate revenue in the form of ticket sales, third party sponsorship and advertising fees, both at the Coliseum and on online broadcasts of tournaments.  The second floor of the eSports Coliseum will provide a tournament play area with space for up to 200 participants who will play video games among themselves. The tournament play area will be equipped with 200 gaming stations, each of which will include the latest in gaming hardware and accessories, a computer with large monitor, desk and ergonomic chair. Participants will be able to enter and play against each other for tournament chips with prize money distributed to the last remaining competitors. We will collect a tournament entry fee for scheduled tournaments and will not have any of our own capital at risk. No spectator seating will be available on the second floor and the tournaments played on the second floor will not be broadcast.  The second floor will also host a full service restaurant and lounge. A portion of the third floor is planned for a roof top patio bar area. The remainder of the third floor will be utilized for offices.  Sales and Marketing  We plan to:  �  implement an affiliate marketing program. Affiliate marketing is a type of performance-based marketing by which a business, such as ours, rewards affiliates for each customer brought by the affiliate's marketing efforts. Affiliate marketing is a very successful form of online marketing and is utilized by global leaders such as Amazon, Apple and all leading online gambling sites.  �  advertise and sponsor major professional eSports events held in stadiums around the world that are broadcast online to a global audience.  �  utilize professional eSports players and other celebrities, who have an interest in video games and eSports, to generate new customers.  �  use a multimedia approach focusing on acquiring and retaining customers.  �  use online advertisements, paid search optimization, and various social media campaigns to increase our online presence and drive traffic to our website.  If we are able to acquire the Grand Princess Casino in Antigua, the VGambling brand will be featured prominently as a major sponsor of professional eSports events heldat the facility and broadcast globally.  Play-money gaming, which is permitted in most jurisdictions, involves players receiving virtual currency for free, or paying a fee to receive additional virtual currency, which can be used to play certain gaming offerings. Some play-money games may require an additional fee to download software upgrades or to buy-in to certain advanced play. Our proposed play-money games will initially consist of simple video games, and later more complex video games. There will no cash prizes or other prizes for monetary value. The primary purpose of the play-money games will be to direct users to our real-money wagering portal   www.vgambling.bet. We currently have eight play-money websites, available in local languages, under development.  Competition  The online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive. With relatively low barriers to entry, new competitors are entering the eSports wagering and video game tournament segments. In both of these segments, there currently exist several major competitors. Because many of these competitors focus on delivering one product, as opposed to a full suite of eSports and video gambling products and services that VGambling intends to offer, the competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the Company. VGambling expects the number of companies offering products and services in each market segment to increase. Many of VGambling's current and potential competitors, including but not limited to Unikorn, Skilz, bet365, William Hill, and Pinnacle Sports, have far greater resources than VGambling.  Regulations Affecting our Business  The offering and operation of online real-money gambling platforms and related software and solutions is subject to extensive regulation and approval by various federal, state, provincial, tribal and foreign agencies (collectively, "gaming authorities"). Gambling laws require us to obtain licenses or findings of suitability from gaming authorities for VGambling, including each of our subsidiaries engaged in these activities, and certain of our directors, officers, employees and in some instances, significant shareholders (typically beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company's outstanding equity). The criteria used by gambling authorities to make determinations as to qualification and suitability of an applicant varies among jurisdictions, but generally require the submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. Gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be found suitable. Gambling authorities generally look to the following criteria when determining to grant a license or finding of suitability, including (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, (ii) the quality and security of the applicant's online real-money platform and gaming equipment and related software, as applicable, (iii) and, the past history of the applicant. Gambling authorities may, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, and (ii) fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some jurisdictions explicitly prohibit gaming in all or certain forms and we will not market our gambling services in these jurisdictions. If any director, officer or employee of ours fails to qualify for a license or is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit the required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required to, sever our relationship with such person, which may include terminating the employment of any such person. Gambling authorities have the right to investigate any individual or entity having a material relationship with us, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable or should be licensed to do business as a business associate of ours. In addition, certain gambling authorities monitor the activities of the entities they regulate both in their respective jurisdiction and in other jurisdictions to ensure that these entities are in compliance with local standards on a worldwide basis. As a regulated entity, we will be required to maintain strong corporate governance standards and will be required to, among other things, maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, maintain systems for accurate record keeping, file periodic reports with gaming authorities and maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations applicable to our business.  We will work to obtain all permits, authorizations, registrations and/or licenses required in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We will have a zero tolerance approach to money laundering, fraud and collusion and we will work with regulators and law enforcement globally in this area. We plan to have a  dedicated compliance team that will work to ensure that we comply with all regulatory requirements under our licenses, as well as all applicable anti-money laundering, anti-fraud and anti-collusion rules and laws.  We will be dedicated to responsible gambling practices and will seek to provide our customers with the resources and services they need to play responsibly. These practices, resources and services are expected to include deposit limits, table and game play limits, voluntary restrictions on access and use of certain games, self-exclusion and cooling off periods, and voluntary permanent exclusions from our services, sites and applications.

VGambling Responsible Gaming 
Mission statement
VGambling is committed to responsible gaming, and is dedicated to an enjoyable and positive gaming experience for all of our players. Most players play for fun and entertainment, but we recognize that a small percentage of players will:

Attempt to play when they’re underage, or
Allow gaming to control them and affect their lives.

The people of VGambling are committed to assisting and protecting those who should not be playing games at all, or who wish to limit the amount that they play.
Age verification
Any underage player who has provided dishonest or inaccurate information regarding their true age may have all winnings forfeited and could face criminal prosecution.
What we do

Every person signing up for a new account at VGambling must check a box that indicates that they are at least 18 years of age. This notifies everybody that we don’t accept players under 18.
When a player creates an account with VGambling, we collect their name, address, and birth date to confirm that the player is at least 18 years old.
VGambling does not target underage players with our marketing and advertising. It is neither good business nor consistent with our personal and corporate values to attract underage players.

What you can do

Be sure to protect your computer. All Windows computers can be set up to have password control so that you must enter a password to get to the desktop. In general, this is a good practice, but it’s even more important when there are children or teenagers in your household. Also, keep your VGambling screen name and password private. You can elect to have the VGambling software not remember your password each time you log into VGambling. If you have any concern that somebody else might attempt to access your VGambling account, you should not allow the VGambling software to remember your password.
If you have children or teenagers in your household, use protection software that allows you to limit the websites to which they have access, prevent file sharing, and generally give you detailed control over how your children use the Internet.

Here is a list of some of those programs:

SafeKids
NetNanny


If you are aware of an underage person using VGambling software, let us know. Simply send an email to support@VGambling.com and we will get right on it. Our first step is to investigate, and if warranted, freeze the player’s account and request identification from that player. We take these reports seriously.
Be a responsible parent. In many ways, this is nothing more than keeping your eyes and ears open. If you hear your children talking about gaming accounts, deposits, and withdrawals, start asking questions. If you see the VGambling client on your child’s computer, uninstall it and ask more questions. A responsible parent is the best start to preventing underage gaming.

Self-exclusion
If you believe that gambling might be a hindrance to your life rather than a form of entertainment, we at VGambling want to help you. First, please review the following questions:

Did you ever lose time from work or school due to playing games?
Has playing games caused you to neglect your own welfare or that of your family?
Have you ever sold anything or borrowed money to finance your playing?
Have you often played until your last dollar was gone?
Have you ever played longer than you had planned?
Have you ever considered self-destruction or suicide as a result of your playing?

If you answered “Yes” to several of these questions, we encourage you to visit Gamblers Anonymous.
Also, we provide you with the ability to exclude yourself from playing on VGambling for various periods of time. To do this, go to the main lobby of the VGambling software, select ‘Tools’, ‘Responsible Gaming’, and ‘Exclude me from playing.’
Please note that all self-exclusions and time outs are irreversible for the duration of the specified time.

We offer 12-hour and 24-hour cooling off periods as well as 7 day, 30 day, 60 day, and 120 day time out periods. You will not be able to play cash games, Sit & Go’s or multi-table tournaments on VGambling and VGambling.net. Once you click the button that requests a time out or a self-exclusion period, you will be asked to close all games at which you’re playing. Once you’ve done that, the time out or self-exclusion period will begin. You will be automatically unregistered from any tournament that begins during the time out and self-exclusion period. You will not be able to deposit or make inter-account transfers with your VGambling account. Furthermore, you will not receive any marketing emails or newsletters from VGambling.
6-month self-exclusion. This is identical to the other time out periods, except that we will ask you to withdraw any real money funds from your VGambling account. In addition, you will not be automatically reinstated. If you want to return to playing on VGambling, you can email support@VGambling.net any time after your self-exclusion period has passed.
Self-exclusions longer than 6 months, and permanent self-exclusions. If you wish to self-exclude yourself longer than 6 months, or permanently self-exclude yourself, please contact support@VGambling.com
Players who self-exclude themselves during a tournament will nevertheless still be able to complete any tournament already in progress in which they are playing. This also means that players who request to be self-excluded from playing on VGambling after qualifying for Day 2 of a Multi-Day Tournament or Phased tournament will still be able to play in that tournament on any subsequent day of that tournament, even after their period of self-exclusion begins. Players who choose not to play on subsequent days will receive no compensation.
You may also wish to investigate GamBlock, a software application that limits a computer’s access to online gaming sites.

 
How to play online games responsibly
If you choose to play online games, there are some general guidelines that can help make your game playing experience safer, and reduce the risk that problems can occur:

Play for entertainment, and not as a way of making money.
Play with money that you can afford to lose. Never use money that you need for important things such as food, rent, bills, or tuition.
Set deposit limits. Use our ‘Restrict Deposit Limit’ feature located under the Tools menu option in the main lobby on the right hand side. Click ‘Tools’ > ‘Responsible Gaming’ > ‘Restrict Deposit Limit’ and ensure you never deposit more than you can afford to lose.
Never chase losses. If you lose money, don’t play higher stakes to try and recoup your losses.
Don’t play games when you are upset, tired, or depressed. It is difficult to make good decisions when you are feeling down.
Balance games with other activities. Find other forms of entertainment so playing games does not become too big a part of your life.

If you feel you might have a gambling problem, and seek further advice or counselling, you can visit these web sites:

GamCare(UK)
Gamble Aware(Ireland)
Adictel(France)
GamblingTherapy(World Wide)
Tactus(Netherlands)
Fejar(Spain)
Gambling Help On Line(Australia)
Responsible Gaming Resource Ctr(Canada)
Center for Ludomani(Denmark)
Morningside Recovery(USA)

Setting limits on your real money deposits
VGambling believes that you should be allowed to manage your own budget for playing online games. We allow you to restrict your own weekly real money deposit limits. Of course, those limits may be no higher than the ones we already have for your account. Just go to the lobby, choose Tools from the menu on the right, then select ‘Responsible Gaming’ > ‘Restrict Deposit Limit’.
In addition, please note that some freemium purchases will count toward your self-imposed limit depending on the payment system chosen for your purchase.
Restricting cash game table limits and tournament limits:
Setting limits and tournament limits provide individual players with an opportunity to control their spending by limiting themselves from playing certain limit stakes, as well as tournament buy in limits. Go to the lobby, choose Tools from the menu on the right, then select ‘Responsible Gaming’ and ‘Restrict Table Limit’ or ‘Restrict Tournament limit’.

VGambling Secures $850,000 Financing Commitment To Launch eSports Wagering Platform and eSports Operations
February 20, 2017


Exclusive Bridge Round Financing Through First Capital Ventures
 
St. Mary’s, Antigua – February 6, 2017 – VGambling Inc. (“VGambling” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: GMBL), a licensed online gambling company with a specific focus on eSports wagering, announced today that it has executed a term sheet for its $850,000 Bridge Round financing. The Financing, available exclusively through Denver, CO-based First Capital Ventures (“First Capital”) is intended to complete the Company’s disruptive peer-to-peer eSports wagering platform and launch its eSports websites. The Financing is expected to be completed within the next 30-45 days, with the first significant traunch expected on or before February 15.
 
“Fortune Magazine has reported that the eSports fan base will outstrip the NFL in 2017, while Chris Grove of Eilers & Krejcik Gaming projects that fans of eSports fans will wager $23 billion by 2020”, stated Gary Graham, President & CEO of First Capital. “Yet traditional betting sites employ a sports book model that is fundamentally ill-suited to eSports. VGambling will be the first to offer a peer-to-peer wagering model dedicated to eSports, and it will be the only site to cover all 5,600 pro tournaments each year (existing sites cover approximately 50 or fewer). And perhaps most important to investors, VGambling is currently the ONLY public vehicle for participating in the global eSports phenomenon. We believe that VGambling is an optimal eSports entry point.”
 
Grant Johnson, President & CEO of VGambling stated, “We are excited to have secured this financing committment from First Capital Ventures. The eSports industry is accelerating at a phenomenal rate and this financing allows us to completion of our eSports wagering platform and launch of our global scale marketing programs.”

VGambling Secures $850,000 Financing Commitment To Launch eSports Wagering Platform and eSports Operations
February 20, 2017


Exclusive Bridge Round Financing Through First Capital Ventures
 
St. Mary’s, Antigua – February 6, 2017 – VGambling Inc. (“VGambling” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: GMBL), a licensed online gambling company with a specific focus on eSports wagering, announced today that it has executed a term sheet for its $850,000 Bridge Round financing. The Financing, available exclusively through Denver, CO-based First Capital Ventures (“First Capital”) is intended to complete the Company’s disruptive peer-to-peer eSports wagering platform and launch its eSports websites. The Financing is expected to be completed within the next 30-45 days, with the first significant traunch expected on or before February 15.
 
“Fortune Magazine has reported that the eSports fan base will outstrip the NFL in 2017, while Chris Grove of Eilers & Krejcik Gaming projects that fans of eSports fans will wager $23 billion by 2020”, stated Gary Graham, President & CEO of First Capital. “Yet traditional betting sites employ a sports book model that is fundamentally ill-suited to eSports. VGambling will be the first to offer a peer-to-peer wagering model dedicated to eSports, and it will be the only site to cover all 5,600 pro tournaments each year (existing sites cover approximately 50 or fewer). And perhaps most important to investors, VGambling is currently the ONLY public vehicle for participating in the global eSports phenomenon. We believe that VGambling is an optimal eSports entry point.”
 
Grant Johnson, President & CEO of VGambling stated, “We are excited to have secured this financing committment from First Capital Ventures. The eSports industry is accelerating at a phenomenal rate and this financing allows us to completion of our eSports wagering platform and launch of our global scale marketing programs.”

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.
