Knight Capital Group, Inc.


                  Knight Capital Group, Inc. is a global financial services firm, which provides access to the capital markets across multiple asset classes to a broad network of clients, including buy and sell side firms, dealers, brokers, institutions, and corporations. It operates business through four segments: Market Making, Institutional Sales and Trading, Electronic Execution Services and Corporate and Other. The Market Making segment consists of market making in global equities and listed domestic options. It includes client, and to a lesser extent, non-client electronic market making activities in which they operate as a market maker in equity securities. The Institutional Sales and Trading segment includes global equity, exchange traded funds and fixed income sales and trading; reverse mortgage origination and securitization; capital markets; and asset management activities. Its business consists of execution and facilitation equities and fixed income transactions as agent on behalf of institutional clients, and they commit capital on behalf of its clients when needed. The Electronic Execution Services segment offers access via its electronic agency-based platforms to markets and self-directed trading in equities, equity options, fixed income, foreign exchange and futures contracts. The Corporate and Other segment invests in strategic financial services-oriented opportunities, allocates, deploys and monitors all capital, and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not attributable to the other segments. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Jersey City, NJ.

NYSE Euronext Foundation, Inc.

                    A leading global operator of financial markets and provider of innovative trading technologies, NYSE Euronext (NYX) is the holding company and the first cross-border exchange group created by the combination of NYSE Group, Inc. and Euronext N.V., on April 4, 2007.  

The Company’s exchanges located in Europe and the United States trade equities, futures, options, fixed-income, and exchange-traded products. With approximately 8,000 listed issues (excluding European Structured Products) from more than 55 countries, NYSE Euronext's equities markets—the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Euronext, NYSE MKT, NYSE Alternext and NYSE Arca—represent one-third of the world's equities trading and the most liquidity of any global exchange group. 
NYSE Euronext also operates NYSE Liffe, a leading European derivatives business and the world's second-largest derivatives business by value of trading, and NYSE Liffe U.S., which is a global, multi-asset class futures exchange.  The U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organization, The New York Portfolio Clearing, LLC ( a joint venture of DTCC and NYSE Euronext)  delivers unique capital efficiencies to the market.
 
The company offers comprehensive commercial technology, connectivity and market data products and services through NYSE Technologies, the world's leading provider of end-to-end electronic trading solutions.  NYSE Technologies’ flexible and scalable products deliver robust and integrated solutions, from single trading positions to complete exchange platforms. Its leading edge software, combined with high performance connectivity, provides the global trading community with innovative tools, access to liquidity and worldwide markets and third-party, value-added applications.
 
NYSE Euronext began trading publicly on March 8, 2006 under the NYX ticker. The historic combination of the NYSE Group and Euronext in 2007 created the first truly global exchange group, and brought together major marketplaces across Europe and the United States whose histories stretch back more than four centuries, including the New York Stock Exchange which was formed with the signing of the Buttonwood Agreement in 1792.  NYSE Euronext is represented in the S&P 500 index, and is the only exchange operator in the Fortune 500.
