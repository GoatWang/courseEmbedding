Early life and education[edit]
Moynihan was born in Marietta, Ohio in 1959,[1] the sixth of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent.[6][7] Moynihan graduated from Brown University in 1981, where he majored in history, co-captained the rugby team, and met his future wife, classmate Susan E. Berry.[8][9] He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School,[10] before returning to Providence, Rhode Island to join Edwards & Angell LLP, the city’s largest corporate law firm.[9]
Career[edit]
Moynihan held numerous banking positions before becoming president of consumer and small business banking at Bank of America in January 2009.[11]
He joined Fleet Boston in April 1993 as a deputy general counsel.[10] From 1999 to April 2004, he served as executive vice president, managing Fleet's brokerage and wealth management division. After Bank of America (BoA) merged with FleetBoston Financial in 2004, he joined BoA as president of global wealth and investment management.[12] He was named CEO of Merrill Lynch after its sale to BoA in September 2008, and became the CEO of Bank of America after Ken Lewis stepped down in 2010.[11]
On August 25, 2011, CNBC's Drew Sandholm noted that "[d]espite having recently told investors Bank of America ... doesn't need to raise capital, CEO Brian Moynihan will accept $5 billion in capital from famed investor Warren Buffett. The deal not only surprised the Fast Money traders on Thursday, it also caused them to question Moynihan's credibility."[13]
On September 12, 2011, CNBC's John Carney noted that Moynihan had "once again laid out his company's plan to meet regulatory capital requirements and denied that the bank will have to issue new stock to raise capital ... [Moynihan] says that Warren Buffett's $5 billion counts as Tier 1 Capital. But the markets have largely ignored the investment, most likely because it looks a lot more like debt than capital."[14]
On October 26, 2011, Huffington Post blogger Jillian Berman noted that BoA "has also been hammered in the stock and bonds markets" and "was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for two-quarters straight ... while Moody's downgraded the bank last month." She added while JPMorgan Chase's CEO[who?] received a $19 million raise in 2010, Moynihan's salary stayed level at $950,000.[15]
On December 27, 2011, Julia LaRoche wrote in Business Insider that Moynihan "admitted the proposed $5 monthly fee for debit card users wasn't the best idea". She quoted him as saying: "We struck a chord with customers that no one anticipated. We learned our lesson and stopped it."[16] It was later reported that the failed fee plan led to a 20% increase in account closures during the last three months of 2011.[17] In late January 2012, Moynihan stated:

"What we need to do is to continue to fine-tune the company, give capital ratios where people understood that we had the capital we knew we had. And then they saw that and that’s why you saw some response in the stock....The core issue now is to drive the core earnings, and we’ve got to get the costs down in the company, which we’re working on. And then as the economy continues to move along, even at the 2 percent growth level, we'll start to materialize more and more earnings, and that's what we need to do."

Business Insider noted that "a group of law professors and activists from a non-profit called Public Citizen sent a 24 page petition to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Geithner asking them to consider breaking up and reforming Bank of America."[18]
Criticism[edit]
The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".[19]
In 2012, Moynihan, alongside several other CEO's, faced heavy criticism from Senator Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) in a report titled "Top Corporate Tax Dodgers". According to the report, Moynihan's Bank of America paid no federal income tax in 2010 and received a $1.9 billion tax refund despite making $4.4 billion in profits. The report also includes criticisms of Bank of America's use of tax havens. [20]

The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".[19]
In 2012, Moynihan, alongside several other CEO's, faced heavy criticism from Senator Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) in a report titled "Top Corporate Tax Dodgers". According to the report, Moynihan's Bank of America paid no federal income tax in 2010 and received a $1.9 billion tax refund despite making $4.4 billion in profits. The report also includes criticisms of Bank of America's use of tax havens. [20]

Early life and education[edit]
Moynihan was born in Marietta, Ohio in 1959,[1] the sixth of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent.[6][7] Moynihan graduated from Brown University in 1981, where he majored in history, co-captained the rugby team, and met his future wife, classmate Susan E. Berry.[8][9] He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School,[10] before returning to Providence, Rhode Island to join Edwards & Angell LLP, the city’s largest corporate law firm.[9]
Career[edit]
Moynihan held numerous banking positions before becoming president of consumer and small business banking at Bank of America in January 2009.[11]
He joined Fleet Boston in April 1993 as a deputy general counsel.[10] From 1999 to April 2004, he served as executive vice president, managing Fleet's brokerage and wealth management division. After Bank of America (BoA) merged with FleetBoston Financial in 2004, he joined BoA as president of global wealth and investment management.[12] He was named CEO of Merrill Lynch after its sale to BoA in September 2008, and became the CEO of Bank of America after Ken Lewis stepped down in 2010.[11]
On August 25, 2011, CNBC's Drew Sandholm noted that "[d]espite having recently told investors Bank of America ... doesn't need to raise capital, CEO Brian Moynihan will accept $5 billion in capital from famed investor Warren Buffett. The deal not only surprised the Fast Money traders on Thursday, it also caused them to question Moynihan's credibility."[13]
On September 12, 2011, CNBC's John Carney noted that Moynihan had "once again laid out his company's plan to meet regulatory capital requirements and denied that the bank will have to issue new stock to raise capital ... [Moynihan] says that Warren Buffett's $5 billion counts as Tier 1 Capital. But the markets have largely ignored the investment, most likely because it looks a lot more like debt than capital."[14]
On October 26, 2011, Huffington Post blogger Jillian Berman noted that BoA "has also been hammered in the stock and bonds markets" and "was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for two-quarters straight ... while Moody's downgraded the bank last month." She added while JPMorgan Chase's CEO[who?] received a $19 million raise in 2010, Moynihan's salary stayed level at $950,000.[15]
On December 27, 2011, Julia LaRoche wrote in Business Insider that Moynihan "admitted the proposed $5 monthly fee for debit card users wasn't the best idea". She quoted him as saying: "We struck a chord with customers that no one anticipated. We learned our lesson and stopped it."[16] It was later reported that the failed fee plan led to a 20% increase in account closures during the last three months of 2011.[17] In late January 2012, Moynihan stated:

"What we need to do is to continue to fine-tune the company, give capital ratios where people understood that we had the capital we knew we had. And then they saw that and that’s why you saw some response in the stock....The core issue now is to drive the core earnings, and we’ve got to get the costs down in the company, which we’re working on. And then as the economy continues to move along, even at the 2 percent growth level, we'll start to materialize more and more earnings, and that's what we need to do."

Business Insider noted that "a group of law professors and activists from a non-profit called Public Citizen sent a 24 page petition to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Geithner asking them to consider breaking up and reforming Bank of America."[18]
Criticism[edit]
The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".[19]
In 2012, Moynihan, alongside several other CEO's, faced heavy criticism from Senator Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) in a report titled "Top Corporate Tax Dodgers". According to the report, Moynihan's Bank of America paid no federal income tax in 2010 and received a $1.9 billion tax refund despite making $4.4 billion in profits. The report also includes criticisms of Bank of America's use of tax havens. [20]

Can Brian Moynihan Save Bank of America?


                    Bank of America’s slide into the unknown has rekindled memories of Lehman Brothers’ collapse. Can the nation’s largest bank survive intact?

On the afternoon of Aug. 23, Gary G. Lynch, the global chief of legal, compliance, and regulatory relations for Bank of America, was attending a meeting in Washington when the floor heaved. Although Lynch, a lanky 61-year-old attorney with swept-back white hair, had never experienced an earthquake, he possessed the good sense to get beneath a sturdy conference table, along with several other people. “If the ceiling came down,” he recalls, “I thought we were dead.” 
The ceiling held, despite the magnitude 5.8 quake rippling from its epicenter in Virginia. Minutes later, Lynch pulled out his BlackBerry and discovered another startling development: a rumor rattling Wall Street that Bank of America might get swept into an involuntary, government-orchestrated rescue by its smaller rival JPMorgan Chase. “This is really getting nuts,” he thought.
Lynch, who as the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the late 1980s brought Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken to heel, knew he’d come under heavy fire when he parachuted into BofA this July. His assignment: Defend against a seemingly endless barrage of multibillion-dollar lawsuits and government investigations concerning defective mortgage-backed bonds manufactured at the height of the real estate bubble. No sooner did one liability bomb explode than it was followed by another. Now Lynch was doing duck-and-cover for real, while the bank’s share price was pounded to within a whisker of $6, down more than 50 percent since Jan. 1. The wild speculation about a forced merger combined ominously with financial analyst chatter that the mortgage onslaught would drain BofA’s capital, requiring it to sell more stock in desperation. Would Bank of America, which just weeks earlier had reported a record second-quarter loss of $8.8 billion, go the way of Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers?








It was starting to smell like 2008. Hotshot BofA investment bankers gaped at $14 restricted stock units, granted in 2010 and early 2011, which on paper had lost half of their value. They began thumbing smartphones for contact info of potential alternative employers. Managers interrupted vacations to rush into the office and calm valuable dealmakers.
Calm of a temporary sort returned two days later, thanks to a theatrical Buffett-ex-machina intervention. Three years ago, Bear was sold for scrap, while Lehman was allowed to collapse into bankruptcy, setting off a global financial crisis and recession. Announced on Aug. 25, Buffett’s purchase of $5 billion in BofA preferred stock—on typical only-for-Warren terms, including a $300 million annual dividend—allowed the bank to edge back from the abyss, much as Buffett’s $5 billion vote of confidence arrested a run on Goldman Sachs stock in 2008. On Sept. 6, only hours after he sat for an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, BofA Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan grabbed attention again by reshuffling his management ranks, elevating a pair of new co-chief operating officers and ousting Sallie Krawcheck, the high-profile head of wealth management. After all the excitement, the bank’s shares were up 19 percent from their nadir.
For now, Bank of America will not go the way of Lehman or Bear. It has $400 billion in cash and liquid investments and, more important, with $2.3 trillion in assets, it exemplifies the sorry concept of “too big to fail.” No matter what anyone says to the contrary, the U.S. government cannot afford to allow a financial institution of that size to go down and drag the rest of the country with it. BofA’s difficulties are too complex, however, to be solved by Buffett swashbuckling, executive replacements, or the retention of a really sharp lawyer. America’s biggest bank is inextricably intertwined with a still-debilitated U.S. housing market and an unemployment rate stuck painfully above 9 percent. 




“Bank of America is the purest reflection of the United States economy of any of the largest financial institutions,” observes John A. Kanas, the chief executive officer of privately held BankUnited. BofA owns or services one in five home loans in the U.S., operates more than 5,700 retail branches, and serves 58 million customers. “As America goes,” says Kanas, “so will Bank of America.” 
Then there’s Countrywide Financial, the worst corporate acquisition in living memory. BofA’s former CEO, Kenneth D. Lewis, bought the California subprime cesspool in 2008; its stench has permeated the Charlotte-based bank ever since. Rampant fretting over whether BofA has sufficient capital and needs to sell more stock traces primarily to fear that it can’t quantify its mounting write-offs and losses connected to hundreds of thousands of mortgages gone bad. So far, the aggregate Countrywide damage exceeds $30 billion. 




“Obviously there aren’t many days when I wake up and think positively about the Countrywide acquisition,” Moynihan said on Aug. 10 during a conference call arranged to reassure anxious investors. Even some of his loyal aides concede that the call, like a series of other pronouncements he has made this year, didn’t comfort many uneasy money managers. Moynihan received his CEO stars in a battlefield promotion in December 2009, after Lewis was perceived as losing investor confidence. A compact 51-year-old former rugby player at Brown University, he has admirers who praise his herculean work ethic and intelligence. Charismatic he is not. Moynihan displays little if any humor in public and swallows many of his words. His out-of-earshot nickname within the bank, according to several employees, is “the Mumbler.” Asked for a self-evaluation during the Aug. 10 conference call, he said: “I think my performance with the management team in terms of transforming the company, I think, has been strong. Our performance on the share performance has not been strong.” 
More serious than his bouts of verbal artlessness, Moynihan has overpromised on critical occasions, most notably in predicting prematurely that he would raise the bank’s penny-a-share dividend this year. Such mistakes have obscured his reasonable attempt to remake the bloated organization he inherited. To his credit he is different from the generation of hubristic bankers typified by Lewis, 64, and former Citigroup CEO Sanford I. Weill, 78. During a prolonged era of bipartisan antiregulatory ideology, the Lewis-Weill cohort built the behemoths that were too big to manage and ultimately too big for Washington to allow to go under. The instability of those institutions contributed to the panic of 2008 and its messy, unfinished cleanup. 
Moynihan, who for six years toiled as Lewis’s lieutenant, seems determined to learn from his former boss’s mistakes. The younger man came into his job planning to sell off extraneous assets acquired by Lewis. In the process he has made the bank a more focused institution that in the long run ought to be less dangerous to the financial system. Whether he has the dexterity to survive the current crisis and complete the task is an open question. 
In the space of only a dozen years, Bank of America transformed itself from an unremarkable regional business into a financial supermarket of gargantuan proportions. Charlotte, in turn, grew into the country’s second-biggest banking center after New York. 
Lewis, who never concealed his Southerner’s disdain for hifalutin Wall Street types, capped an extraordinary acquisition spree in 2008, first by absorbing Countrywide, a subprime-mortgage factory on the verge of bankruptcy. Then, with encouragement from the Bush Administration, he took over Merrill Lynch, the faltering brokerage and investment bank. Merrill turned out to be Lewis’s undoing; he lost his job in 2009 when questions arose over whether he fully disclosed its precarious financial condition as he pushed BofA shareholders to approve the $29 billion deal.
Moynihan had joined the ballooning BofA in 2004, when Lewis paid $47 billion for FleetBoston Financial, itself the product of rapid-fire mergers and acquisitions. The Fleet executive had a law degree from the University of Notre Dame but set his sights higher than the legal department. Many of his Boston-based former colleagues couldn’t—or chose not to—adjust to life under the notoriously demanding Lewis. Moynihan adapted. Years later, in his 2005 book Winning, former General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch held him up as a model of corporate stamina: “He showed exactly what you should show if you want to survive a merger—enthusiasm, optimism, and thoughtful support.” 
At Bank of America, Moynihan didn’t specialize. Like a leather-helmeted footballer of yore, he played offense and defense and, in a pinch, came in to punt. To make absolutely sure he got no sleep, he often commuted to BofA’s large New York outpost from Boston, where his family—wife, Susan Berry, an attorney, and three young children—remained. His dedication inspires awe in the office. “Flash or pizzazz isn’t what clients want,” says Purna Saggurti, Bank of America’s chairman of global corporate and investment banking. “Clients want content and a trusted adviser.”
As Lewis’s grip on his empire loosened in 2009, Moynihan, lacking deep roots in Charlotte or a proven CEO’s credential, was a dark horse candidate to succeed him. But the bank’s directors were feuding, and other candidates fell away. In December, Moynihan walked into a New York hotel room to meet with the board of directors’ search committee. He held a single sheet of paper on which he had written a strategic vision that actually could have fit on a note card: enough already with the acquisitions, let’s get back to banking (or words to that effect). He got the job.
Lewis hosted a large ceremony in Charlotte to introduce the new CEO. “Many of you know him,” the outgoing chief executive said of Moynihan, “because he’s been in so many different jobs. And so, hopefully, he’ll be in this job much longer than the last three or four.” The audience of Bank of America employees, many wearing the company’s red-white-and-blue flagscape lapel pin, laughed. Standing to the side of the auditorium stage, Moynihan smiled tightly. The backhanded compliments continued. “Another unique characteristic about him,” Lewis noted, “is that he wanted the job.” With that inauspicious endorsement, Moynihan took control of a vast assemblage of businesses, which collectively had received federal cash injections totaling $45 billion and appeared to be on life support. 
Then, with miraculous speed, Merrill began to recover. The acquisition that brought down Lewis became a surprise turnaround story. Federal bailout money was repaid. In April 2010, to everyone’s relief, the rookie CEO announced a first-quarter profit of $3.2 billion.
On a less happy note, Countrywide, a relative detail in 2008, was metastasizing into a disaster. When speaking privately, Bank of America executives will now acknowledge that Countrywide behaved deplorably during the real estate frenzy. In June 2010, BofA agreed to pay $108 million to settle federal charges that Countrywide overcharged mortgage customers. The firm “profited from making risky loans to homeowners during the boom years, and then profited again when the loans failed,” the Federal Trade Commission asserted. As a formal matter, BofA didn’t admit or deny the allegations, saying instead that it agreed to the settlement “to avoid the expense and distraction associated with litigating the case.” 
The expense and distraction were just beginning. In the fall of 2010, with consumer complaints about mortgage abuses increasing, BofA temporarily halted foreclosures across the country. Moynihan said the bank was modifying Countrywide mortgage terms to keep people in their houses—20,000 modifications a month by late 2010. Contrary to expectations, though, home prices continued to slump in many areas, and overall economic growth remained weak, despite the Federal Reserve’s policy of keeping interest rates essentially at zero.
New threats came into focus. Even as state and federal prosecutors revved up investigations of fraud in the issuing and servicing of loans by Countrywide and its former competitors, other antagonists filed complaints. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental housing finance companies, argued that millions of mortgages they bought as part of their mission to spur homeownership were turning out to be rotten. Fannie and Freddie wanted Bank of America (and other lenders) to buy back billions in defective loans. In addition, there were unhappy institutional investors that had purchased mortgage-backed securities, a type of bond assembled from bundles of home loans. When broke borrowers stopped paying on the mortgages, the bonds defaulted. Investors wanted compensation. On Oct. 18, 2010, one bondholder group led by BlackRock and Pacific Investment Management (Pimco) sent BofA a stern letter demanding the bank buy back mortgages packaged into $47 billion of bonds. There was no reason to think the BlackRock demand would be the last of its kind. 
A day later, BofA announced an $872 million third-quarter 2010 provision to resolve mortgage repurchase claims. That compared with $1.25 billion in the second quarter and $526 million in the first. Moynihan tried to allay nervousness over a perpetually open spigot. “It’s a half billion, half billion, half billion,” he said during an investor conference call. “Those are the kinds of numbers that would be more recurring.” In other words: Half a billion dollars per quarter may seem like a lot to ordinary folk, but we can handle it. 
Not that Bank of America would surrender those half-a-billions without a fight. “It’s day-to-day, hand-to-hand combat,” Moynihan told an investor conference in New York in November 2010. All the same, he said in December, the bank planned to increase its dividend as fast as possible—a signal that its capital levels were sound. “I don’t see anything that would stop us,” he added. In January 2011, he had yet more encouraging news: The bank would take an additional $3 billion provision to settle claims from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie and Freddie. “We are pleased to put the GSEs behind us this quarter,” Moynihan said on Jan. 21.
He spoke too soon. “Brian, while he is a very experienced executive, is an inexperienced chief executive,” notes BankUnited CEO John Kanas, a Moynihan fan. “He has made a couple of political mistakes, overpromising.”
On Mar. 23, Bank of America admitted in a regulatory filing that the Federal Reserve had rejected its request for a dividend increase in the second half of 2011. Among the four largest U.S. lenders, a group rounded out by JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, BofA was the only one that didn’t announce a higher dividend after the Fed reviewed the companies’ financial health in March. In an interview with Bloomberg News, Jonathan Hatcher, a credit strategist at Jefferies in New York, called the Fed action “a soft warning shot” across Bank of America’s bow. 
More warnings followed. In April, BofA announced a $1.6 billion deal with Assured Guaranty to resolve claims tied to tainted mortgage-backed securities the insurance company had covered. Outstanding mortgage-buyback demands climbed to $13.6 billion, the bank said the same month. Then, in May, it conceded in a regulatory filing that the cost of private-investor demands might rise to between $11 billion and $14 billion, or $4 billion more than the previously publicized range. Later in May, Moynihan said that the settlement with Fannie Mae might have sprung a leak, as the larger GSE stepped up its buyback demands. “We still have some work to do” on resolving Fannie Mae demands, Moynihan conceded. In June, BofA said it agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle claims by the BlackRock-Pimco group of bondholders.
Bank of America generates an enormous amount of revenue—$111.2 billion in 2010—so it can afford to settle a lot of liability claims. “The problem,” says William B. Smith, the CEO of Smith Asset Management, a New York hedge fund, “is the unknown.” By midsummer it became apparent that no one, including Bank of America, understood the ultimate damage attributable to Countrywide. 
Smith Asset Management, nevertheless, owns BofA stock. “For those of us who are bullish, we don’t believe the mortgage hit is crippling,” William B. Smith says. “Those who are bearish believe it is.” Like a number of other investors, he takes solace from market analysis showing that BofA’s breakup value exceeds its current market value of about $76 billion. “Tear this thing apart after you get down the road a bit,” says Smith, and the stock could triple in value. 
That’s not what Bank of America’s management or its 285,000 employees want to hear. Nor does the notion that Bank of America might be worth more dismembered provide any consolation to hundreds of thousands of homeowners behind on their mortgage payments, some of whom accuse BofA or its blacksheep subprime-mortgage unit of mistreating them. “They were greedy. … It was a bad decision [to acquire Countrywide],” says Don Barrett, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in Lexington, Miss., who is representing allegedly defrauded borrowers. “If Bank of America is going to survive, they’d better get closure. They need closure with investors, but they also need closure with the legitimate borrowers.”
Brian Moynihan’s private conference room on the 58th floor of the Bank of America Corporate Center in downtown Charlotte has the usual photo of its occupant with the incumbent President, along with other CEO knickknacks. Moynihan has draped a canary-yellow T-shirt where every visitor can see it. “Grind Together, Shine Together,” the black lettering on the shirt instructs, and Moynihan presents himself as a grind-it-out kind of guy.
He recognizes that he sees one company, while Wall Street lately sees another. “We have the strongest capital we’ve ever had in the company for decades,” he says. “We have the strongest liquidity.” He sounds frustrated. The bank has $115 billion in what is known as Tier One common equity, which translates to a capital ratio of 8.2 percent under today’s rules. That’s more than enough to meet current requirements and puts BofA well within shooting distance of tougher international standards that will be phased in over coming years, Moynihan says. (“Litigation aside, there’s nothing wrong with this company,” says Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia who is now an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Va.)
How will Moynihan close the perception gap? 
“We have to keep educating and pounding and pounding and pounding,” he says. “The No. 1 thing for me was to make the company clearer, more focused, get away from the acquisition heritage of big is great, as opposed to great is great.”
No question he’s slimmed the bank down. He has sold off assets worth nearly $40 billion. These include stakes in a bank in Brazil ($3.9 billion) and one in Mexico ($2.5 billion); a $10.9 billion investment in BlackRock; a $2.3 billion portion of an insurance company; more modestly valued credit-card portfolios in the U.K., Spain, and Canada; and, most recently, half of Bank of America’s stake in China Construction Bank, which sold for $8.3 billion. The Lewis-era binge left BofA with all kinds of pointless overhead. “Nobody sat down and said, ‘We want 63 data centers.’ We inherited 63 data centers,” says Moynihan. He intends to get that down to the single digits.
He frames the Sept. 6 management shake-up as a streamlining maneuver. Where there had been no chief operating officer, now there will be two, promoted from within: David C. Darnell will oversee businesses responsible for serving individual customers, including deposits, credit cards, home mortgages, and wealth management. Thomas K. Montag will supervise operations related to corporations and institutional investors. “They are accountable now for delivering our entire franchise to all our customers and clients,” Moynihan said in a written announcement. Joe Price, who had been president of consumer and small business banking, was ousted along with Sallie Krawcheck, the former wealth-management chief.
Moynihan is in no mood, however, to apologize. He says he has no regrets about promising to raise the dividend and then not being able to follow through. He waves off the criticism as missing the larger point that shareholders will benefit in the long run from a stronger, better capitalized bank. Similarly, he dismisses suggestions that he’s an ineffective public communicator. His job is to make sure that every employee understands that at all times they should be serving one of the bank’s three customer groups: individuals, companies, and institutional investors. Because he has pounded this home so consistently, he adds, “There’s 285,000 people could probably give that speech right now.” (Or maybe fewer. Moynihan has announced 6,000 layoffs so far this year, with more to come.)
The CEO doesn’t utter the word “Countrywide” voluntarily. He won’t comment on one option—putting the unit into bankruptcy—and he refers to the mess in shorthand: “We have to keep taking uncertain risks and eliminate them, and that’s what we’ve been doing in the mortgage area.” For Countrywide details, he recommends talking to Gary Lynch.
Bank of America’s top in-house lawyer works in a serene sanctum high above Sixth Avenue in New York. The room features cool white marble and white leather. Lynch has made a career of remaining unruffled—at the SEC during its 1980s insider-trading investigations, later as a partner at the New York corporate law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, and then as the senior-most attorney at investment banks Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley. 
It’s no wonder that Moynihan hired Lynch, but is the attorney still glad he moved over to Bank of America? Lynch laughs, a public relations man holds his breath, and the lawyer says yes. 
With professorial precision he proceeds to sort the categories of legal risks facing BofA into three “buckets.” Over time, he explains, the bank can gradually empty each bucket. First, there are “representations and warranties” claims, such as those made by the GSEs and the BlackRock-Pimco bondholder group. Those parties want BofA to buy back mortgages allegedly based on false information about borrowers or property. Bank of America has negotiated compromise payments for most of the reps-and-warranties claims. 
Bucket No. 2 contains fraud lawsuits filed by investors who bought mortgage-backed securities, which have lost value. A lawsuit filed Aug. 8 by American International Group, the New York-based insurance giant, sits in that bucket; AIG seeks damages of $10 billion. Lynch says the bank will fight the vast majority of such suits. “I’d much rather be sued by AIG than by someone who has never purported to be an expert on mortgages and risk management,” he notes. His point is that AIG is a sophisticated financial player that should have known that subprime-backed bonds could explode. 
Finally, there’s a bucket for government allegations that Countrywide generated fraudulent foreclosure documents. BofA and other large lenders are skirmishing with the 50 state attorneys general in hopes of reaching a mass settlement whose collective price tag has been estimated at $20 billion.
Sweeping a long arm over his imaginary litigation receptacles, Lynch seems sure of himself. Statutes of limitation are running out, and that’s why so many lawyers rushed to the courthouse this summer, he says. “We’re comfortable that these securitization cases will go away or be settled for cents on the dollar,” he adds. “At the end of the day, do we have ample capital to get through this? Absolutely.”
“If someone is going to say, ‘O.K., Counselor, tell me exactly what you’re going to pay out,’ I can’t do that, and I wouldn’t try,” Lynch acknowledges. What’s more, he says, the mortgage litigation won’t get resolved in three months or six months or a year. “Past cases of this type have been working through the process for years.”
The problem, from his clients’ perspective, is that even when Bank of America says it has something resolved, new doubts clutter the bucket. The state AGs’ settlement seems, in broad outline, like a reasonable idea. Big lenders fork over cash to make borrowers whole and modify the terms on some mortgages so people can keep their homes. But lately, attorneys general in New York, Delaware, and Nevada have broken ranks, saying they don’t want to rush to a truce because they’re not through investigating lenders’ misbehavior. Moreover, the New York prosecutor, Eric T. Schneiderman, has challenged the propriety of the $8.5 billion settlement with private bondholders, casting uncertainty on that pact, too.
For all the angst over Bank of America on Wall Street and in the media, regulators at the Federal Reserve and Treasury Dept., speaking privately because they are not authorized to comment on particular banks, say they have watched Moynihan’s performance and are mostly pleased by what they’ve seen. In fact they applaud his shrinking the company and similar moves by some of his competitors. 
One of the paradoxes of the 2008 crisis has been that, in its aftermath, a U.S. financial industry overpopulated with institutions considered too big to fail became even more consolidated. Mergers such as Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill and Countrywide, and JPMorgan’s absorption of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual have produced a quartet of megabanks that together hold $7.7 trillion in assets, or 56.8 percent of the U.S. total, compared with 45.2 percent of the total before the crisis.
Even with this added consolidation, and the potential risk it perpetuates in the event of a true investor or depositor run on any of the megabanks, regulators say there has not been much for them to do about Bank of America’s difficulties. New oversight tools created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation enacted in 2010 are still being crafted. And industry lobbyists are still trying to blunt rules on how much capital banks must hold, how they sell mortgages, and what kind of trading they can do for their own accounts. To avoid future taxpayer bailouts, the law required major banks to submit “living wills,” or plans for how they could be efficiently dismembered in dire circumstances. But details on the living-will process are still being debated; no wills have been submitted to Washington. (Regulators say Bank of America hasn’t gotten into living-will territory, because the bank has cash on hand and the ability to borrow more.) So far the Dodd-Frank law’s perverse effect has been to heighten uncertainty without disentangling the combinations of investment banking with consumer and commercial banking that proved so perilous in the wake of the housing bubble. 
One positive change is that there are more cops walking the banking beat. About 30 examiners from the Fed’s Richmond (Va.) branch are assigned full-time to monitoring Bank of America, up from 14 in 2007. Fed staff members say they are able to give closer scrutiny to the bank’s securities and loan portfolios, as well as the risk associated with its assets and the adequacy of its capital. In early summer, when Fed officials requested options BofA might consider if overall economic conditions seriously eroded, the bank responded that one possibility would be to issue a separate class of shares linked to the performance of Merrill Lynch, according to BofA. Moynihan does not think such a step will be needed and similarly has no plans to sell more BofA common stock, his aides say.
While Fed examiners are supposed to be keeping an eye out for reckless practices within BofA, there’s a danger that other government officials and politicians could hasten a fresh financial meltdown as they seek their pound of assets from Bank of America. The state-AG foreclosure probe has identified troubling past practices, but the handful of prosecutors holding up a resolution could jeopardize the prize they desire. Likewise, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of BofA’s other main antagonists, are each almost 80 percent-owned by U.S. taxpayers as a result of rescues at the depths of the financial crisis. The GSEs are “we the people”; if they help take Bank of America down, taxpayers will have to mop up. On Sept. 2, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Washington regulator of Fannie and Freddie, joined the fray. In its own brace of lawsuits, the FHFA accused Bank of America and 16 other lenders of misleading Fannie and Freddie about billions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities.
The problem for Moynihan, says Lou Barnes, “is that everyone is suing him, he can’t know when the suits will stop, and meanwhile—hello?—the economy isn’t bouncing back, and it’s damned tough to get a home loan approved out here.” Barnes, a banker and credit analyst at Premier Mortgage Group in Boulder, Colo., argues that Moynihan “looks to be doing as well as any little Dutch boy can—sticking his fingers in the dike.”

But more cracks keep opening up. Barnes ticks off the latest statistics from Lender Processing Services, a major home-loan servicer: 4.1 million loans nationwide are 90 or more days delinquent or in foreclosure; delinquency rates are twice their historical norm; foreclosure rates are eight times higher than the historical average; more than 40 percent of 90-days-plus delinquent loans have not made a payment in more than a year. 
BofA is more exposed to those scary figures than any other bank. Moynihan “has got to know there are more losses ahead, enough to kill a bank,” says Barnes. “No model exists for what happens next.”

Brian T. Moynihan, chief of Bank of America, is increasingly coming under pressure to demonstrate his ability not only to lead Bank of America, the nation’s second-largest bank, but to expand it as well.

Just two weeks ago in a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Bruce Thompson, the chief financial officer of Bank of America, took a victory lap.The bank, long troubled by expensive legal woes stemming from the mortgage crisis, appeared to have finally turned a corner as its quarterly earnings soared. Bank of America’s balance sheet, Mr. Thompson crowed, had “never been stronger.” That week, he played a round of golf with the chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, in Charlotte, N.C., where the bank is based.A few days later, Mr. Thompson was out.Mr. Thompson’s move seemed strangely abrupt. But it had actually been in the works for some time. Banking regulators were told of his possible exit well in advance of last Wednesday’s announcement, people briefed on the matter said.Still, the move stunned analysts and investors, who wondered what was going on at the top of the bank. Mr. Thompson’s was the most prominent of a series of moves in the executive suites. And that turnover had occurred at a time of tensions between the various parts of the bank. Former executives describe the relationships between Mr. Moynihan and some members of his leadership team as “strained.”

All this adds to the burden of Mr. Moynihan, who is increasingly coming under pressure to demonstrate his ability not only to lead the nation’s second-largest bank— a complex organization with $2.1 trillion in assets, clashing cultures, geographic silos and various power battles within — but also to expand it.

It’s a herculean task that he has struggled with.Since Mr. Moynihan was named chief executive in late 2009, Bank of America’s stock performance has lagged the nation’s so-called mega-banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.Bank of America has taken more than $70 billion in charges — an amount nearly as big as the stock market value of U.S. Bancorp — to pay, for the most part, legal fines, settlements and penalties largely related to its consumer mortgage business. Last year, the bank faced an embarrassing $4 billion error in its books that caused regulators to delay a promised stock-buyback plan. Again, on this year’s stress test, Bank of America received only conditional approval because of concerns about weakness in internal controls around capital planning.While executives at other banks were able to bolster profits more easily by shedding businesses and slashing costs, Mr. Moynihan, his defenders noted, was stuck managing the enormous financial and legal fallout brought on by two transformational mergers undertaken by his predecessor, Kenneth D. Lewis: the acquisitions of the mortgage lender Countrywide and the investment banking giant Merrill Lynch in 2008.“I think Moynihan has done a reasonably good job of dealing with the legacy issues, but I don’t think he gets the same respect as some of his peers and my question is, Is he the right guy going forward?” asked Jonathan Finger, a partner at Houston-based Finger Interests, which owns about 900,000 shares of Bank of America.Mr. Moynihan’s critics inside and outside the bank say he has struggled to articulate a clear strategic path to growth. The bank instead has relied too much, they say, on a potential increase in interest rates to bolster profits.At the same time, there is no clear successor to Mr. Moynihan inside the bank. The most prominent — and possibly most powerful — top executive is the chief operating officer and head of the investment bank, Thomas K. Montag, who is not considered a likely candidate for the job unless he is asked to step in during an emergency.In a phone interview from his offices in Boston, Mr. Moynihan said he had managed to cut expenses, bolster capital cushions and rebuild the brand of a company that had become the face of the nation’s foreclosure crisis and a punching bag for politicians seeking tougher regulation of Wall Street.









 



“No one took the amount of hits that we took,” Mr. Moynihan said. “No one had a deeper hole to get out of.”

A bank spokesman says it is more relevant to measure the company’s performance since 2012, which is when Mr. Moynihan’s strategy of simplifying the company and working through legal issues began to take hold. Over that three-year period, Bank of America’s shares have far outshone competitors’. The recent lag in the share price, the spokesman said, is only natural after its previous run-up.But by other measures, Bank of America is still climbing out of a hole. Despite some one-time items that helped bolster profits in the second quarter, the bank’s revenue in certain key businesses has been declining faster than expenses. A barrage of new regulations has curbed the ability of banks to generate profits in nearly everything they do — from trading bonds to issuing credit cards.While many banks face a similar predicament, Bank of America’s trials are compounded by Mr. Moynihan’s challenge of integrating a hodgepodge of businesses — and personalities — assembled largely in a time of crisis.Moreover, they say, Mr. Moynihan, 55, has surrounded himself with a close-knit circle of loyal lieutenants — many from his days at the regional bank FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Bank of America in 2003.At least five of the 13 members of Mr. Moynihan’s executive management team, including a co-head of consumer banking, its leader of global wealth and investment management, its corporate auditor and its head of global strategy, have ties to FleetBoston.Among these close allies, insiders say, there is no obvious heir apparent — though one name that gets mentioned is Dean Athanasia, a co-head of consumer banking, who is 49 years old.Mr. Moynihan said: “My guess is that whoever succeeds me is in their 40s today, not someone in their 50s.”

The departing C.F.O., Mr. Thompson, 50, was widely seen as the person in line to fill Mr. Moynihan’s shoes, but his star dimmed, people briefed on the matter said, after the bank miscalculated its capital levels by $4 billion last year.Mr. Moynihan was angry at Mr. Thompson and his team for the mistake, people briefed on the matter said. He appointed a trusted former FleetBoston colleague to take over the bank’s preparation for its stress test submissions, a job that had been done by the C.F.O.Mr. Moynihan brushes off any suggestions of strain among his leadership team, attributing any tensions to the natural frictions at a bank that has undergone a sea change over the last six years.“We were never an international bank and now we are one,” Mr. Moynihan said. “We were not a major investment bank in global market activity and now we are one. On the consumer side, we had been a product company that relied too much on overdraft fees, and I ended that. There are all these cultures that needed to change.”When he was first named chief executive, Mr. Moynihan seemed an unlikely choice to pull off that transformation.

Sometimes referred to as “the accidental C.E.O.,” Mr. Moynihan was initially heading out the door as a result of the Merrill Lynch acquisition. But he survived the merger and, later, when Mr. Lewis was ousted, landed on a very short list of potential C.E.O.s.Named chief executive in late 2009, Mr. Moynihan is described as having a probing, scientific intellect and a knack for digging into financials and locating bad assets. A college rugby player and a lawyer by training, he had also earned the nickname “Mumbles” for his rapid speaking style that many said could be difficult to keep up with.Mr. Moynihan typically starts the week in Boston (he did not want to uproot his children, who when he got the job were attending public school in a Boston suburb) and then flies either to the bank’s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., or New York.

Several former Merrill Lynch executives said Mr. Moynihan was hardly ever seen visiting the trading floors of the bank’s soaring glass tower in Midtown Manhattan.

That has long been the territory of Mr. Moynihan’s powerful No. 2, Mr. Montag.The highest-paid member of the bank’s management team, Mr. Montag operates the investment banking business, which has churned out strong profits in recent years from booms in high-yield markets and deal-making activity.A former high school athlete, Mr. Montag had a meteoric career inside Goldman Sachs that spanned more than two decades. He ran Goldman’s derivatives business before becoming co-head of Goldman’s Japan operations, eventually returning to the United States to co-head the investment bank’s global securities business.After being passed over to become the president of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Montag was lured to Merrill Lynch by another Goldman Sachs alumnus, John A. Thain.Mr. Montag’s $39 million pay package initially irritated many Merrill Lynch traders and salesmen — they were staring at their Bloomberg screens that showed their own holdings in the investment bank disintegrating in the fall of 2008. Yet Mr. Montag managed to win over many of them.“The guy can really rally up a room,” a former trader said.While some said Mr. Montag, 58, harbored ambitions to lead Bank of America, others inside the bank said they did not believe he was ever a viable candidate. For instance, some said, it had been difficult for him to contain his frustration with sweeping new banking regulations, a reality for any bank chief.Two former high-ranking bank executives said relations between Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Montag, who was named the bank’s sole chief operating officer last fall, had been strained.Inside the bank, others dispute the idea that there are tensions between its top two leaders.They note that Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Montag frequently travel the world together, meeting with investors and often winding up having a beer and ribbing one another about their college football teams. (Mr. Moynihan attended Brown and Notre Dame Law School and Mr. Montag graduated from Stanford.)In a rare interview, Mr. Montag compared Mr. Moynihan to the current chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein.

“One thing that Lloyd and Brian have in common is that they are both really smart,” Mr. Montag said. “I listen to really smart people.”

He credits Mr. Moynihan for articulating a consistent message about the need to simplify the business from a vast collection of consumer and investment banking units into a cohesive company.Having been a partner at Goldman when the firm went public in 1999, Mr. Montag had already amassed a large nest egg when he joined the bank. He says he stays there because he likes the work, which he described as building a new model for an investment bank.“I am fortunate to have the luxury and freedom to do what I want to do,” Mr. Montag added.Still, Mr. Montag makes even more than his boss. In 2014, Mr. Montag was paid $14 million compared with Mr. Moynihan’s $13 million.“He makes more money because that’s what I recommend to the board,” Mr. Moynihan said. “If it bothered me, I would change it.”In a five-page memo to employees last week announcing a series of management changes, Mr. Montag was the first person Mr. Moynihan mentioned, even though his job was not changing.It wasn’t until Page 3 that Mr. Moynihan announced that Mr. Thompson was stepping down as chief financial officer.Mr. Moynihan said that after more than five years as chief risk officer and chief financial officer, Mr. Thompson was ready to do something new. People briefed on the matter said Mr. Thompson wanted a new job running a business, but there was no clear next step for him at the bank.

“I felt I never would leave the company when it was not in a good place,” Mr. Thompson said in an interview. “When you look where we came out in the second quarter, it was the most profitable quarter we have had since 2007.”Still, his departure left investors perplexed. “I haven’t spoken to anyone who isn’t surprised,” said Mike Mayo, a CLSA banking analyst, who has a sell rating on the bank. “It’s a head-scratcher.”People close to the bank, none of whom would speak on the record because they frequently interact with the two men, said the relationship between Mr. Montag and Mr. Thompson had been tense at times.Mr. Montag said such suggestions were “nonsense,” while Mr. Thompson said he had a “good working relationship” with Mr. Montag.Disagreements may be expected when a large retail bank marries a hard charging investment bank.Mr. Moynihan says he encourages tensions between his top executives. As chief financial officer, Mr. Thompson had to put limits on how Mr. Montag and other executives could deploy the bank’s capital to generate returns.“Those are natural tensions that I foster,” Mr. Moynihan said. “I want there to be a dialogue, and I decide how it all plays out.”

 Correction: July 29, 2015  
An article on Tuesday about challenges facing Bank of America and its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, misstated how the $70 billion in charges for fines, settlements and penalties the bank has taken compares to the market value of U.S. Bancorp. It is nearly as much as U.S. Bancorp’s value, which is about $80 billion; it is not more than that value.

Bank of America gave its chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, a pay package last year that was 23 percent larger than in 2014, as the big bank generated higher profits and put its mortgage problems squarely behind it.Mr. Moynihan’s $16 million pay package includes a $1.5 million cash salary and $14.5 million in restricted stock awards tied to certain performance goals. The package does not include a cash bonus.In 2014, a year in which the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., paid billions of dollars to settle investigations into its sale of faulty mortgage securities, Mr. Moynihan received a $13 million pay package.The Bank of America board’s decision to increase Mr. Moynihan’s pay package reflects the bank’s improved performance in 2015, as it increased its capital levels and generated $16 billion in profit compared with $4.8 billion in 2014.

But for all the progress Bank of America has made in recovering from the losses of the financial crisis, investors have been punishing the bank’s shares. During a wider decline in the market, Bank of America’s shares have dropped 29 percent since the start of the year. The shares of large banks have dropped more sharply than the broader stock market.Even with his pay raise, Mr. Moynihan remains on the lower end of the compensation scale among Wall Street chief executives.JPMorgan Chase increased Jamie Dimon’s pay package 35 percent to $27 million last year.Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief of Goldman Sachs, saw his pay package reduced for the first time since 2011. Last year, his pay was $23 million, $1 million less than he made in 2014.At Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman’s compensation as chief decreased to $21 million, from $22.5 million.

Early life and education[edit]
Moynihan was born in Marietta, Ohio in 1959,[1] the sixth of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent.[6][7] Moynihan graduated from Brown University in 1981, where he majored in history, co-captained the rugby team, and met his future wife, classmate Susan E. Berry.[8][9] He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School,[10] before returning to Providence, Rhode Island to join Edwards & Angell LLP, the city’s largest corporate law firm.[9]
Career[edit]
Moynihan held numerous banking positions before becoming president of consumer and small business banking at Bank of America in January 2009.[11]
He joined Fleet Boston in April 1993 as a deputy general counsel.[10] From 1999 to April 2004, he served as executive vice president, managing Fleet's brokerage and wealth management division. After Bank of America (BoA) merged with FleetBoston Financial in 2004, he joined BoA as president of global wealth and investment management.[12] He was named CEO of Merrill Lynch after its sale to BoA in September 2008, and became the CEO of Bank of America after Ken Lewis stepped down in 2010.[11]
On August 25, 2011, CNBC's Drew Sandholm noted that "[d]espite having recently told investors Bank of America ... doesn't need to raise capital, CEO Brian Moynihan will accept $5 billion in capital from famed investor Warren Buffett. The deal not only surprised the Fast Money traders on Thursday, it also caused them to question Moynihan's credibility."[13]
On September 12, 2011, CNBC's John Carney noted that Moynihan had "once again laid out his company's plan to meet regulatory capital requirements and denied that the bank will have to issue new stock to raise capital ... [Moynihan] says that Warren Buffett's $5 billion counts as Tier 1 Capital. But the markets have largely ignored the investment, most likely because it looks a lot more like debt than capital."[14]
On October 26, 2011, Huffington Post blogger Jillian Berman noted that BoA "has also been hammered in the stock and bonds markets" and "was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for two-quarters straight ... while Moody's downgraded the bank last month." She added while JPMorgan Chase's CEO[who?] received a $19 million raise in 2010, Moynihan's salary stayed level at $950,000.[15]
On December 27, 2011, Julia LaRoche wrote in Business Insider that Moynihan "admitted the proposed $5 monthly fee for debit card users wasn't the best idea". She quoted him as saying: "We struck a chord with customers that no one anticipated. We learned our lesson and stopped it."[16] It was later reported that the failed fee plan led to a 20% increase in account closures during the last three months of 2011.[17] In late January 2012, Moynihan stated:

"What we need to do is to continue to fine-tune the company, give capital ratios where people understood that we had the capital we knew we had. And then they saw that and that’s why you saw some response in the stock....The core issue now is to drive the core earnings, and we’ve got to get the costs down in the company, which we’re working on. And then as the economy continues to move along, even at the 2 percent growth level, we'll start to materialize more and more earnings, and that's what we need to do."

Business Insider noted that "a group of law professors and activists from a non-profit called Public Citizen sent a 24 page petition to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Geithner asking them to consider breaking up and reforming Bank of America."[18]
Criticism[edit]
The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".[19]
In 2012, Moynihan, alongside several other CEO's, faced heavy criticism from Senator Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) in a report titled "Top Corporate Tax Dodgers". According to the report, Moynihan's Bank of America paid no federal income tax in 2010 and received a $1.9 billion tax refund despite making $4.4 billion in profits. The report also includes criticisms of Bank of America's use of tax havens. [20]

Early life and education[edit]
Moynihan was born in Marietta, Ohio in 1959,[1] the sixth of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent.[6][7] Moynihan graduated from Brown University in 1981, where he majored in history, co-captained the rugby team, and met his future wife, classmate Susan E. Berry.[8][9] He earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Notre Dame Law School,[10] before returning to Providence, Rhode Island to join Edwards & Angell LLP, the city’s largest corporate law firm.[9]
Career[edit]
Moynihan held numerous banking positions before becoming president of consumer and small business banking at Bank of America in January 2009.[11]
He joined Fleet Boston in April 1993 as a deputy general counsel.[10] From 1999 to April 2004, he served as executive vice president, managing Fleet's brokerage and wealth management division. After Bank of America (BoA) merged with FleetBoston Financial in 2004, he joined BoA as president of global wealth and investment management.[12] He was named CEO of Merrill Lynch after its sale to BoA in September 2008, and became the CEO of Bank of America after Ken Lewis stepped down in 2010.[11]
On August 25, 2011, CNBC's Drew Sandholm noted that "[d]espite having recently told investors Bank of America ... doesn't need to raise capital, CEO Brian Moynihan will accept $5 billion in capital from famed investor Warren Buffett. The deal not only surprised the Fast Money traders on Thursday, it also caused them to question Moynihan's credibility."[13]
On September 12, 2011, CNBC's John Carney noted that Moynihan had "once again laid out his company's plan to meet regulatory capital requirements and denied that the bank will have to issue new stock to raise capital ... [Moynihan] says that Warren Buffett's $5 billion counts as Tier 1 Capital. But the markets have largely ignored the investment, most likely because it looks a lot more like debt than capital."[14]
On October 26, 2011, Huffington Post blogger Jillian Berman noted that BoA "has also been hammered in the stock and bonds markets" and "was the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average for two-quarters straight ... while Moody's downgraded the bank last month." She added while JPMorgan Chase's CEO[who?] received a $19 million raise in 2010, Moynihan's salary stayed level at $950,000.[15]
On December 27, 2011, Julia LaRoche wrote in Business Insider that Moynihan "admitted the proposed $5 monthly fee for debit card users wasn't the best idea". She quoted him as saying: "We struck a chord with customers that no one anticipated. We learned our lesson and stopped it."[16] It was later reported that the failed fee plan led to a 20% increase in account closures during the last three months of 2011.[17] In late January 2012, Moynihan stated:

"What we need to do is to continue to fine-tune the company, give capital ratios where people understood that we had the capital we knew we had. And then they saw that and that’s why you saw some response in the stock....The core issue now is to drive the core earnings, and we’ve got to get the costs down in the company, which we’re working on. And then as the economy continues to move along, even at the 2 percent growth level, we'll start to materialize more and more earnings, and that's what we need to do."

Business Insider noted that "a group of law professors and activists from a non-profit called Public Citizen sent a 24 page petition to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Geithner asking them to consider breaking up and reforming Bank of America."[18]
Criticism[edit]
The bank's 2012 shareholder meeting in Charlotte, North Carolina convened "as protests swirled inside and outside", according to the San Francisco Chronicle. There were complaints from shareholders regarding the bank's mortgage servicing operations, decreased share prices, and other issues. Protesters converged outside the building, which they were barred from entering by police and metal barricades. In response to the criticisms of the bank's mortgage servicing operations, Moynihan tried to reassure the audience, saying "you can call us and we will figure it out".[19]
In 2012, Moynihan, alongside several other CEO's, faced heavy criticism from Senator Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) in a report titled "Top Corporate Tax Dodgers". According to the report, Moynihan's Bank of America paid no federal income tax in 2010 and received a $1.9 billion tax refund despite making $4.4 billion in profits. The report also includes criticisms of Bank of America's use of tax havens. [20]

Ignoring Massive Industry Fraud, Bank Of America CEO Hypes Benefits Of Faster ForeclosuresFollowSign in / Sign upThinkProgressBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingMoving news forward.Oct 7, 2011Ignoring Massive Industry Fraud, Bank Of America CEO Hypes Benefits Of Faster ForeclosuresBy Lee FangSpeaking at the Atlantic Idea Fest earlier this week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan sat down for a televised interview with CNBC’s Larry Kudlow. Defending the bank’s new $5 per month debit card fee, Moynihan invented something he called the “right to make a profit.”But another segment of the interview sheds a great deal of light on how Bank of America sees its role in the economy. A year ago, Bank of America was among the many banks caught in a sweeping “robo-signing” scandal, in which documents were allegedly fabricated in places all over the country in order to foreclose on more homes. Although Bank of America has continued using robo-signing tactics today, Moynihan and Kudlow dismissed the potentially massive fraud, and bantered about how faster foreclosures could be great for the country:KUDLOW: Isn’t it fair to say the faster the foreclosure, the better off we’re going to be? And I know there’s pain. But of course, some people lose, other people win. Young families come in, they’re going going to get very low prices. But the point is, the faster we clear our the unsold inventory, the sooner this country might start creating jobs in a real economic growth situation. Is that fair?MOYNIHAN: You can look at the markets and see where the markets have had the inventory cleared, you’re seeing prices stabilize.KUDLOW: So these attorneys general around the country that were blocking you because there were a few bad robo-type-letters or whatever they were, robo-signing letters. They’re keeping the economy on its back because they won’t let the housing market adjust and they’re all over Bank of America, you’re like their favorite guy.Watch:Praising the speed of foreclosures in California, Moynihan said the state has “faired reasonably well” considering the housing market. His remarks might have been aimed at California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Harris recently withdrew from the multi-state settlement deal with the banks, in part because of her concern with the big banks’ attempt to gain legal immunity for the robo-signing fraud.ShareNever miss a story from ThinkProgress, when you sign up for Medium.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
