                    03.12.2015
                




Baar-Zug, Switzerland, 3 December 2015 
Partners Group closes its latest global real estate program at over USD 1.1 billion  


Partners Group, the global private markets investment manager, has closed Partners Group Global Real Estate 2014, its latest global private real estate program, at over USD 1.1 billion. The program is the third of its kind and is successor to Partners Group Global Real Estate 2011, which closed at over USD 800 million in 2012. It will be deployed on behalf of investors in direct, secondary and primary real estate transactions according to Partners Group's unique integrated investment approach.At the time of closing, the program was 49% committed to a range of investments and was already demonstrating strong performance. Direct investments in the program include a portfolio of four indoor shopping centers in Norway, eight residential properties in Denmark, and a portfolio of warehouse and distribution facilities located in US secondary markets with solid market fundamentals. Secondary investments in the program include Partners Group's recently announced purchase of a tail-end portfolio of quality US real estate assets including two hotels, as well as several cash flow-generating property portfolios in the Nordics and Switzerland, which were acquired at significant discounts to net asset value.Claude Angéloz, Partner and Co-Head Private Real Estate, comments: "The even stronger interest we have seen from clients in our 2014 global real estate program highlights the continued appeal of our global integrated approach, based on our systematic relative value investment strategy. In addition to the fund, many of our large clients have chosen to pursue the same strategy through customized separate accounts. In the past 18 months we have seen significant deal flow, in particular for direct and secondary investments. We will continue to invest selectively on behalf of our clients across geographies and transaction types, with a particular focus on acquiring properties at attractive valuations, and on value creation opportunities in the retail, office, industrial, hotel, and residential property markets." Investors in Partners Group Global Real Estate 2014 include a mix of new and re-upping institutional investors from public and corporate pension plans, endowment funds and foundations, insurance companies and financial institutions from around the world.
