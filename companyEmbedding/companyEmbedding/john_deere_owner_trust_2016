July 27, 2016 03:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the John Deere Owner 
      Trust 2016-B (JDOT 2016-B) notes:
    

      -- $243,600,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      -- $221,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $220,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $70,610,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      -- $19,362,916 certificates not rated.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'John Deere Owner Trust 2016-B', dated July 14, 
      2016, which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details 
      how Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Concentration of AG Equipment: JDOT 2016-B is comprised of 
      approximately 75% AG equipment, consistent with the prior transactions 
      dating back to 2011. While AG equipment historical losses have been low, 
      the high concentration in the pool limits diversification. However, 
      geographic diversity, diversification within the AG sector, and 
      equipment versatility help mitigate the high concentration.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 75.2% AG and 
      24.8% CO equipment. These concentrations are consistent with those of 
      JDOT 2016. Furthermore, the pool consists of 61.7% annual-pay contracts, 
      which historically have experienced a lower level of losses versus other 
      payment types.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      JDOT 2016-B is 3.50%, consistent with 3.51% in JDOT 2016. The initial 
      reserve in JDOT 2016-B is 1.00%, while the subordinated certificates 
      provide 2.50% enhancement. Initial excess spread in JDOT 2016-B is 
      expected to be approximately 2.11%, up from 1.94% in JDOT 2016. Under 
      Fitch's 'AAAsf' scenario, CE for the class A notes was able to withstand 
      more than 5.0x the expected net loss rate of 1.00%.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: JDCC has demonstrated 
      strong capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized 
      trusts and its managed portfolio. All securitizations issued and rated 
      by Fitch have performed within initial base case expectations.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence 
      focused on comparing or recalculating certain information with respect 
      to 120 receivables. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

19th century[edit]



This section needs additional citations for verification. (April 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Deere & Company began when John Deere, born in Rutland, Vermont, USA on February 7, 1804, moved to Grand Detour, Illinois in 1836 to escape bankruptcy in Vermont. Already an established blacksmith, Deere opened a 1,378-square-foot (128 m2) shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels. Small tools production was just a start; the item that set him apart, was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.
In 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the Rock River in Illinois. This factory, named the "L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to Moline, Illinois, to have access to the railroad and the Mississippi River. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a 1,440-square-foot (134 m2) factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate & Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.

Deere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son Charles Deere. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere & Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide. This same year, Deere & Company won "Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety" at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won $10 and a Silver Medal.[6]
The core focus remained on the agricultural implements, but John Deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the 1890s.[citation needed]
20th century[edit]




John Deere Plow & Cultivators Co.'s New Orleans House, 1903


Increased competition during the early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of gasoline tractors came to define Deere & Company's operations during the 20th century.

In 1912, Deere & Company president William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.
The company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.[7]
On an episode of the Travel Channel series Made in America that profiled Deere & Company, host John Ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from American farmers during the Great Depression.[8]
During World War II, the great-grandson of John Deere, Charles Deere Wiman, was president of the company, but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army. A replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late 1944, Wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the War Production Board.[9] In addition to farm machinery, John Deere manufactured military tractors, and transmissions for the M3 tank. They also made aircraft parts, ammunition, and mobile laundry units to support the war effort.[10]
In 1947, John Deere introduced its first self-propelled combine, the model 55. It was soon followed by the smaller models 40 and 45, the larger model 95, and an even larger model 105 was introduced in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, Deere introduced attachable corn heads, allowing crop producers to cut, shell, and clean corn in one smooth operation.[7]
In 1956, Deere & Company bought-out the German tractor manufacturer, Heinrich Lanz AG (see Lanz Bulldog).




A John Deere-Lanz 700 tractor


On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers from around the world converged on Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the "New Generation of Power", the company’s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus, a popular Dallas-based department store.
According to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the "largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted." During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to Love Field in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see "a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor."
Since entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.[11]
The 4010 was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the 4020, which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere's optional Power Shift, enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.
In addition to the advanced engine technology, the "10" series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the "10" series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the "10" series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.[12][13][14]
In 1972, Deere introduced its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body. This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An 8-track tape player was also available as an option. The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horse' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.
In 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850. These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed Power Shift transmission, and were available with optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius. They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, not the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by the Deere's completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.
In the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total work force of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:

John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment
John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings
John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements *John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements

The John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population.[15]
In 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combine imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.
In 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.[16]
In the late 1970s, International Harvester had pioneered rotary combines with their Axial flow machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.[7]
21st century[edit]
As of 2014[update], Deere & Company employed about 67,000 people worldwide, of which half are in the United States and Canada, and is the largest agriculture machinery company in the world. In August 2014, the company announced it was indefinitely laying off 600 of its workers at plants in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas due to less demand for its products.[17] Inside the United States, the company's primary locations are its administrative center in Moline, Illinois, and manufacturing factories in central and southeastern United States.[18] As of 2016[update], the company experiments with an electric farm tractor.[19]
The logo of the leaping deer has been used by this company for over 155 years. Over the years, the logo has had minor changes and pieces removed. Some of the older style logos have the deer leaping over a log.[20][21] The company uses different logo colors for agricultural vs. construction products. The company's agricultural products are identifiable by a distinctive shade of green paint, with the inside border being yellow. While the construction products are identifiable by a shade of black with the deer being yellow, and the inside border also being yellow.
Products[edit]
John Deere manufactures a wide range of products, with several models of each in many cases.
Agricultural equipment[edit]
Agricultural products include, among others, tractors, combine harvesters, cotton harvesters, balers, planters/seeders, silage machines, and sprayers.

Former[edit]

John Deere Renewables, LLC, a wind energy plant manufacturing arm which represented John Deere's extension into the renewable energy industry - under which it had successfully completed 36 projects in eight US states - was sold to Exelon Energy in August 2010.[25]

Pop culture[edit]

Joe Diffie released a song in 1993 called "John Deere Green", a top-five hit.
Kenny Chesney released a song in 1999 called "She Thinks my Tractor's Sexy" referencing John Deere Tractors, saying "She ain't into cars or pick up trucks,

But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up"

George Jones famously drove a John Deere lawn tractor to a liquor store after his wife had taken away his car keys to keep him from driving drunk. The incident was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took my car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.[26]

Sponsorships[edit]

The John Deere Classic is an American professional golf tournament sponsored by the company.
John Deere sponsored the #23 and #97 cars for NASCAR driver Chad Little in the late 1990s.[27]

Controversies[edit]
Some groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,[28][29] have taken issue with the fact that John Deere's license covering the internal software on tractor control computers does not allow them to modify the software and that John Deere claims doing so would be DMCA forbidden bypassing of DRM.[30] John Deere locks tractors digitally under usage of the DMCA DRM-law to prevent the DIY repairing by the owning farmers, stating safety concerns as reason.[31]
Green Magazine[edit]
Green Magazine is a publication devoted to John Deere enthusiasts[32][33] which began in November 1984 by Richard and Carol Hain of Bee, Nebraska. The first issue mailed in early November 1984 to 135 paid subscribers consisted of 10 black and white pages with features on tractors, letters from readers, and advertisements.[34] At the time, the magazine was published bimonthly. The writing was done in Lincoln, Nebraska, and it was mailed from the Bee, Nebraska, post office. The magazine grew rapidly, and in 1990, bowing to public demand, the magazine became a monthly. Circulation continued to increase, and at the current time hovers around 30,000. The magazine now generally contains 88 full-color pages and is perfect bound. It is now printed in Michigan and mailed from several different post offices throughout the country.
Current content usually includes a "Tip of the Month" article covering New Generation restoration written by Dan Brotzman, a "Youngtimer" article written by Tyler Buchheit, "Shop Talk" by Ron and JoAnn O'Neill, "Saw it On eBay" by Adam Smith and Benjamin Hain, "Scale Models" by Bill Proft, "What's New and Old" by Greg Stephen, "Feature Model" by Benjamin Hain, "Do You Have One of These" by Richard Hain, and "Mr. Thinker", which is said to be written by "a variety of experts".

19th century[edit]



This section needs additional citations for verification. (April 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Deere & Company began when John Deere, born in Rutland, Vermont, USA on February 7, 1804, moved to Grand Detour, Illinois in 1836 to escape bankruptcy in Vermont. Already an established blacksmith, Deere opened a 1,378-square-foot (128 m2) shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels. Small tools production was just a start; the item that set him apart, was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.
In 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the Rock River in Illinois. This factory, named the "L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to Moline, Illinois, to have access to the railroad and the Mississippi River. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a 1,440-square-foot (134 m2) factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate & Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.

Deere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son Charles Deere. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere & Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide. This same year, Deere & Company won "Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety" at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won $10 and a Silver Medal.[6]
The core focus remained on the agricultural implements, but John Deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the 1890s.[citation needed]
20th century[edit]

Increased competition during the early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of gasoline tractors came to define Deere & Company's operations during the 20th century.

In 1912, Deere & Company president William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.
The company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.[7]
On an episode of the Travel Channel series Made in America that profiled Deere & Company, host John Ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from American farmers during the Great Depression.[8]
During World War II, the great-grandson of John Deere, Charles Deere Wiman, was president of the company, but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army. A replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late 1944, Wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the War Production Board.[9] In addition to farm machinery, John Deere manufactured military tractors, and transmissions for the M3 tank. They also made aircraft parts, ammunition, and mobile laundry units to support the war effort.[10]
In 1947, John Deere introduced its first self-propelled combine, the model 55. It was soon followed by the smaller models 40 and 45, the larger model 95, and an even larger model 105 was introduced in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, Deere introduced attachable corn heads, allowing crop producers to cut, shell, and clean corn in one smooth operation.[7]
In 1956, Deere & Company bought-out the German tractor manufacturer, Heinrich Lanz AG (see Lanz Bulldog).




A John Deere-Lanz 700 tractor


On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers from around the world converged on Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the "New Generation of Power", the company’s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus, a popular Dallas-based department store.
According to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the "largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted." During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to Love Field in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see "a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor."
Since entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.[11]
The 4010 was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the 4020, which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere's optional Power Shift, enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.
In addition to the advanced engine technology, the "10" series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the "10" series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the "10" series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.[12][13][14]
In 1972, Deere introduced its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body. This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An 8-track tape player was also available as an option. The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horse' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.
In 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850. These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed Power Shift transmission, and were available with optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius. They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, not the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by the Deere's completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.
In the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total work force of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:

John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment
John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings
John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements *John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements

The John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population.[15]
In 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combine imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.
In 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.[16]
In the late 1970s, International Harvester had pioneered rotary combines with their Axial flow machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.[7]
21st century[edit]
As of 2014[update], Deere & Company employed about 67,000 people worldwide, of which half are in the United States and Canada, and is the largest agriculture machinery company in the world. In August 2014, the company announced it was indefinitely laying off 600 of its workers at plants in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas due to less demand for its products.[17] Inside the United States, the company's primary locations are its administrative center in Moline, Illinois, and manufacturing factories in central and southeastern United States.[18] As of 2016[update], the company experiments with an electric farm tractor.[19]
The logo of the leaping deer has been used by this company for over 155 years. Over the years, the logo has had minor changes and pieces removed. Some of the older style logos have the deer leaping over a log.[20][21] The company uses different logo colors for agricultural vs. construction products. The company's agricultural products are identifiable by a distinctive shade of green paint, with the inside border being yellow. While the construction products are identifiable by a shade of black with the deer being yellow, and the inside border also being yellow.

John Deere manufactures a wide range of products, with several models of each in many cases.
Agricultural equipment[edit]
Agricultural products include, among others, tractors, combine harvesters, cotton harvesters, balers, planters/seeders, silage machines, and sprayers.

Former[edit]

John Deere Renewables, LLC, a wind energy plant manufacturing arm which represented John Deere's extension into the renewable energy industry - under which it had successfully completed 36 projects in eight US states - was sold to Exelon Energy in August 2010.[25]

Pop culture[edit]

Joe Diffie released a song in 1993 called "John Deere Green", a top-five hit.
Kenny Chesney released a song in 1999 called "She Thinks my Tractor's Sexy" referencing John Deere Tractors, saying "She ain't into cars or pick up trucks,

But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up"

George Jones famously drove a John Deere lawn tractor to a liquor store after his wife had taken away his car keys to keep him from driving drunk. The incident was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took my car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.[26]

Sponsorships[edit]

The John Deere Classic is an American professional golf tournament sponsored by the company.
John Deere sponsored the #23 and #97 cars for NASCAR driver Chad Little in the late 1990s.[27]

Controversies[edit]
Some groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,[28][29] have taken issue with the fact that John Deere's license covering the internal software on tractor control computers does not allow them to modify the software and that John Deere claims doing so would be DMCA forbidden bypassing of DRM.[30] John Deere locks tractors digitally under usage of the DMCA DRM-law to prevent the DIY repairing by the owning farmers, stating safety concerns as reason.[31]
Green Magazine[edit]
Green Magazine is a publication devoted to John Deere enthusiasts[32][33] which began in November 1984 by Richard and Carol Hain of Bee, Nebraska. The first issue mailed in early November 1984 to 135 paid subscribers consisted of 10 black and white pages with features on tractors, letters from readers, and advertisements.[34] At the time, the magazine was published bimonthly. The writing was done in Lincoln, Nebraska, and it was mailed from the Bee, Nebraska, post office. The magazine grew rapidly, and in 1990, bowing to public demand, the magazine became a monthly. Circulation continued to increase, and at the current time hovers around 30,000. The magazine now generally contains 88 full-color pages and is perfect bound. It is now printed in Michigan and mailed from several different post offices throughout the country.
Current content usually includes a "Tip of the Month" article covering New Generation restoration written by Dan Brotzman, a "Youngtimer" article written by Tyler Buchheit, "Shop Talk" by Ron and JoAnn O'Neill, "Saw it On eBay" by Adam Smith and Benjamin Hain, "Scale Models" by Bill Proft, "What's New and Old" by Greg Stephen, "Feature Model" by Benjamin Hain, "Do You Have One of These" by Richard Hain, and "Mr. Thinker", which is said to be written by "a variety of experts".

19th century[edit]



This section needs additional citations for verification. (April 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Deere & Company began when John Deere, born in Rutland, Vermont, USA on February 7, 1804, moved to Grand Detour, Illinois in 1836 to escape bankruptcy in Vermont. Already an established blacksmith, Deere opened a 1,378-square-foot (128 m2) shop in Grand Detour in 1837, which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels. Small tools production was just a start; the item that set him apart, was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich Midwestern soil stuck, so had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth-sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
The traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow, As Deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model, he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale; this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand, but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly.
In 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new, two-story factory along the Rock River in Illinois. This factory, named the "L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and around 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to Moline, Illinois, to have access to the railroad and the Mississippi River. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a 1,440-square-foot (134 m2) factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate & Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two-story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production.

Deere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son Charles Deere. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows, including wagons, corn planters, and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son-in-law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere & Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide. This same year, Deere & Company won "Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety" at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won $10 and a Silver Medal.[6]
The core focus remained on the agricultural implements, but John Deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the 1890s.[citation needed]
20th century[edit]

Increased competition during the early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of gasoline tractors came to define Deere & Company's operations during the 20th century.

In 1912, Deere & Company president William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.
The company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2, in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s, John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient.[7]
On an episode of the Travel Channel series Made in America that profiled Deere & Company, host John Ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from American farmers during the Great Depression.[8]
During World War II, the great-grandson of John Deere, Charles Deere Wiman, was president of the company, but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the U.S. Army. A replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late 1944, Wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the War Production Board.[9] In addition to farm machinery, John Deere manufactured military tractors, and transmissions for the M3 tank. They also made aircraft parts, ammunition, and mobile laundry units to support the war effort.[10]
In 1947, John Deere introduced its first self-propelled combine, the model 55. It was soon followed by the smaller models 40 and 45, the larger model 95, and an even larger model 105 was introduced in the 1960s. In the mid-1950s, Deere introduced attachable corn heads, allowing crop producers to cut, shell, and clean corn in one smooth operation.[7]
In 1956, Deere & Company bought-out the German tractor manufacturer, Heinrich Lanz AG (see Lanz Bulldog).




A John Deere-Lanz 700 tractor


On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers from around the world converged on Dallas, Texas, for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the "New Generation of Power", the company’s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus, a popular Dallas-based department store.
According to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the "largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted." During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to Love Field in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere & Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see "a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor."
Since entering the tractor business in 1918, John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four- and six-cylinder tractors, the models 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010, were more far more powerful than Deere's two-cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility, and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service.[11]
The 4010 was rated at 80 horsepower in 1960, but tested at 84 horsepower during testing trials, making it one of the most powerful two-wheel-drive farm tractors at that time. The 4010 was the predecessor to the 4020, which is widely regarded as the most popular tractor ever produced by John Deere, and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the United States. Although the 4020, which was available with Deere's optional Power Shift, enjoyed greater popularity, the 4010 moved John Deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late 1950s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology.
In addition to the advanced engine technology, the "10" series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older two-cylinder models they replaced, including significantly higher horsepower-to-weight ratio, advanced hydraulics, more convenient and comfortable operator stations, and many other improvements. Of the "10" series John Deere tractors introduced in 1960, the 4010 was by far the most popular, with more than 58,000 units sold from 1960 to 1963. The success of the "10" series John Deere tractors, led by the 4010, helped propel John Deere from a 23% market share in 1959 to 34% by 1964 when the 4020 was introduced, making it the top manufacturer of farm equipment in the United States.[12][13][14]
In 1972, Deere introduced its new 'Sound Idea' tractors, the 4030, 4230, 4430, and 4630. While these tractors were mechanically similar to the New Generation tractors they replaced, and the 4230, 4430, and 4630 used a 404-cubic-inch displacement engine like the 4020, they featured redesigned sheet metal and most importantly they were available with an optional completely integrated operator's cab that John Deere called the Sound Gard body. This insulated cab that included a roll-over protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning, as well as speakers for an optional radio. An 8-track tape player was also available as an option. The 5020 was replaced by the very similar 6030 and continued in production with New Generation styling until 1977 when the 30 Series tractors were replaced by Deere's 'Iron Horse' series that included the 90-hp 4040, 110-hp 4240, 130-hp 4440, 150-HP 4640, and 180-hp 4840. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new 466-cubic-inch displacement engine, and improvements to the cab including an optional hydraulic seat for a smoother ride. The Sound Gard body and Power Shift transmission were standard equipment on the 4840.
In 1983, Deere introduced the 4050, 4250, 4450, 4650, and 4850. These tractors were essentially the same machines as the Iron Horses they replaced, but with significant upgrades. They offered a new 15-speed Power Shift transmission, and were available with optional mechanical front-wheel drive featuring caster action for better traction and a tighter turning radius. They also featured cosmetic upgrades, including a new light brown cab interior, not the black interior on previous models. These tractors were followed by the mechanically similar 55 and 60 series tractors before they were replaced by the Deere's completely redesigned 7000 and 8000 series tractors in the early 1990s.
In the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company, claimed a total work force of 35,000, of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, Illinois, with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, Illinois. The six plants in Moline were listed as:

John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline, where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline, where 500 employees made earth-moving equipment
John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline, where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings
John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements *John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline, where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements
John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements

The John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois, where 140 employees were listed as making iron work and implement parts. Moline, with 42,705 residents in 1962, had the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population.[15]
In 1969, John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a New Generation of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600, and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s, these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, and 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. The 4420 was discontinued in 1984 and replaced by the 4425 combine imported from Germany, and the 6620, 7720, and 8820 received the Titan II updates.
In 1989, Deere replaced the 6620, 7720, and 8820 with a new line of completely redesigned 'Maximizer' combines that included the 9400, 9500, and 9600 walker combines. These combines were completely redesigned and featured a center-mounted cab, rear-mounted engine, and more comforts in the cab. Also in 1989, Deere was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 1997, Deere celebrated 50 years of self-propelled combine production, and the 1997 models featured a 50th-anniversary decal. In 1998, the 9410, 9510, and 9610 were introduced. These were essentially the same machines, but with minor upgrades. Deere dealers offered '10 series' upgrades to owners of older 9000 series Maximizer combines. In 1999, Deere introduced the 50 series Maximizer combines. These machines featured significant cosmetic upgrades including a more streamlined appearance, improved ergonomics in the cab, PTO shaft-style header hook-up, and the larger models were available as rotary machines which were a complete departure from the combines that Deere had built in the past.[16]
In the late 1970s, International Harvester had pioneered rotary combines with their Axial flow machines, and were soon followed by other manufacturers, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1999, John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9550, 9650, and 9750 combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling.[7]
21st century[edit]
As of 2014[update], Deere & Company employed about 67,000 people worldwide, of which half are in the United States and Canada, and is the largest agriculture machinery company in the world. In August 2014, the company announced it was indefinitely laying off 600 of its workers at plants in Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas due to less demand for its products.[17] Inside the United States, the company's primary locations are its administrative center in Moline, Illinois, and manufacturing factories in central and southeastern United States.[18] As of 2016[update], the company experiments with an electric farm tractor.[19]
The logo of the leaping deer has been used by this company for over 155 years. Over the years, the logo has had minor changes and pieces removed. Some of the older style logos have the deer leaping over a log.[20][21] The company uses different logo colors for agricultural vs. construction products. The company's agricultural products are identifiable by a distinctive shade of green paint, with the inside border being yellow. While the construction products are identifiable by a shade of black with the deer being yellow, and the inside border also being yellow.

Former[edit]

John Deere Renewables, LLC, a wind energy plant manufacturing arm which represented John Deere's extension into the renewable energy industry - under which it had successfully completed 36 projects in eight US states - was sold to Exelon Energy in August 2010.[25]

Pop culture[edit]

Joe Diffie released a song in 1993 called "John Deere Green", a top-five hit.
Kenny Chesney released a song in 1999 called "She Thinks my Tractor's Sexy" referencing John Deere Tractors, saying "She ain't into cars or pick up trucks,

But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up"

George Jones famously drove a John Deere lawn tractor to a liquor store after his wife had taken away his car keys to keep him from driving drunk. The incident was later memorialized as part of country music lore in numerous songs and videos, including Jones’ own “Honky Tonk Song” in 1996. Twelve years earlier, the video for Hank Williams Jr.’s “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight” featured George Jones riding a lawnmower. Vince Gill’s 1993 hit “One More Last Chance” includes the line, “She might have took my car keys, but she forgot about my old John Deere.” The video ends with Gill on a John Deere tractor passing Jones on a John Deere lawnmower. The video for John Rich’s “Country Done Come to Town” also features Jones on a riding lawnmower.[26]

Sponsorships[edit]

The John Deere Classic is an American professional golf tournament sponsored by the company.
John Deere sponsored the #23 and #97 cars for NASCAR driver Chad Little in the late 1990s.[27]

Controversies[edit]
Some groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,[28][29] have taken issue with the fact that John Deere's license covering the internal software on tractor control computers does not allow them to modify the software and that John Deere claims doing so would be DMCA forbidden bypassing of DRM.[30] John Deere locks tractors digitally under usage of the DMCA DRM-law to prevent the DIY repairing by the owning farmers, stating safety concerns as reason.[31]
Green Magazine[edit]
Green Magazine is a publication devoted to John Deere enthusiasts[32][33] which began in November 1984 by Richard and Carol Hain of Bee, Nebraska. The first issue mailed in early November 1984 to 135 paid subscribers consisted of 10 black and white pages with features on tractors, letters from readers, and advertisements.[34] At the time, the magazine was published bimonthly. The writing was done in Lincoln, Nebraska, and it was mailed from the Bee, Nebraska, post office. The magazine grew rapidly, and in 1990, bowing to public demand, the magazine became a monthly.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

instruments on behalf of the Trust and sue and be sued.

SECTION 2.02 Office
. The office of the Trust shall be in care of the Owner
Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office or at such other address as
the Owner Trustee may designate by written notice to the Owners and
the Depositor.

SECTION 2.03 Purposes and
Powers . The purpose of the Trust is to engage in the
following activities:

(a) to issue the Notes pursuant to
the Indenture and to sell the Notes upon the written order of the
Depositor, and pursuant to this Agreement to issue a Certificate
with a $19,362,916 aggregate principal amount to the Depositor upon
the written order of the Depositor;

(b) with the proceeds of the sale of
the Notes and the issuance of the Certificate, to pay the Depositor
the amounts owed pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, by directing the Representatives to wire
transfer such proceeds in accordance with instructions received
from the Depositor;

(c) with the proceeds from capital
contributions from the Depositor, to fund the Reserve Account and
to pay organizational and transactional expenses of the
Trust;

(d) to assign, grant, transfer,
pledge, mortgage and convey the Trust Estate pursuant to the
Indenture and to hold, manage and distribute to the Owner pursuant
to the terms of the Sale and Servicing Agreement any portion of the
Trust Estate released from the Lien of, and remitted to the Trust
pursuant to, the Indenture;

obligations under the Basic Documents to which it is to be a
party;

(f) to engage in those activities,
including entering into agreements, that are necessary, suitable or
convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental thereto or

and the making of distributions to the Owner and the
Noteholders.
 
4



The Trust shall not engage in any
activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than
as required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the
Basic Documents.

SECTION 2.04 Appointment of
Owner Trustee . The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner
Trustee as trustee of the Trust effective as of the date hereof, to
have all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.05 Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . The Depositor hereby sells,
assigns, transfers, conveys and sets over to the Owner Trustee, as
of the date hereof, the sum of $1.00. The Owner Trustee hereby
acknowledges receipt in trust from the Depositor, as of the date
hereof, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the
initial Owner Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the
Certificate Distribution Account. The Depositor shall pay
organizational expenses of the Trust as they may arise or shall,
upon the request of the Owner Trustee, promptly reimburse the Owner
Trustee for any such expenses paid by the Owner Trustee.

SECTION 2.06 Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will
hold the Owner Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the
conditions set forth herein for the use and benefit of the Owner,
subject to the obligations of the Trust under the Basic
Documents. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the
Trust constitute a statutory trust under the Trust Statute and that
this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust.  It is the intention of the parties that the
Trust will be disregarded as an entity separate from the Owner for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as provided by Treasury Regulation
Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii). In the event, however, that
during its term the Trust has more than one beneficial owner or
member, then the parties agree, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to treat the Trust as a partnership and to take no action
inconsistent with the treatment of the Trust as a
partnership. In such event, the parties agree that, unless
otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the Trust will
elect to be treated as a partnership and will file or cause to be
filed annual or other necessary returns, reports and other forms
consistent with the characterization of the Trust as a partnership
for such tax purposes and in accordance with Section 5.05
herein. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee
shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and in
the Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the
Trust. In no event shall the Trust elect to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation. To the extent
practicable, the Depositor shall make an election on Internal
Revenue Service Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, for the
Trust to be disregarded as a separate entity from the
Owner.

SECTION 2.07 Liability of
the Owner .

(a) The Depositor shall be liable
directly to and will indemnify the injured party for all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses of the Trust (including
Expenses, to the extent not paid out of the Owner Trust Estate) to
the extent that the Depositor would be liable if the Trust were a
partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership
Act in which the Depositor were a general partner; provided,
however, that the Depositor shall not be
 
5


liable for any losses incurred by a
Certificateholder in the capacity of an investor in the Certificate
or a Noteholder in the capacity of an investor in the
Notes. In addition, any third-party creditors of the Trust
(other than in connection with the obligations described in the
preceding proviso, for which the Depositor shall not be liable)
shall be deemed third-party beneficiaries of this paragraph. The
obligations of the Depositor under this paragraph shall be
evidenced by the Certificate described in
Section 3.10.

(b) The Owner, other than to the
extent set forth in paragraph (a), shall not have any personal
liability for any liability or obligation of the Trust.

SECTION 2.08 Title to Trust
Property . Legal title to all the Owner Trust Estate shall
be vested at all times in the Trust as a separate legal entity
except where applicable law in any jurisdiction requires title to
any part of the Owner Trust Estate to be vested in a trustee or
trustees, in which case title shall be deemed to be vested in the
Owner Trustee, a co-trustee and/or a separate trustee, as the case
may be.

SECTION 2.09 Situs of
Trust . The Trust will be located in the State of
Delaware. All bank accounts maintained by the Owner Trustee on
behalf of the Trust shall be located in the State of
Delaware. The Trust shall not have any employees in any State
other than Delaware; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
restrict or prohibit the Owner Trustee from having employees within
or without the State of Delaware.

SECTION 2.10 Representations
and Warranties of the Depositor . The Depositor hereby
represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) the Depositor is duly organized
and validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the
laws of the State of Nevada, with power and authority to own its
properties and to conduct its business as such properties are
currently owned and such business is presently
conducted;

(b) the Depositor is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing, and has
obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in all jurisdictions
in which the failure to so qualify or to obtain such license or
approval would render any Receivable unenforceable that would
otherwise be enforceable by the Depositor, the Sub-Servicer or the
Owner Trustee;

(c) the Depositor has the power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to carry out
its terms; the Depositor has full power and authority to sell and
assign the property to be sold and assigned to and deposited with
the Trust and the Depositor shall have duly authorized such sale
and assignment and deposit to the Trust by all necessary corporate
action; and the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement has been duly authorized by the Depositor by all
necessary corporate action; and

(d) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of
the terms hereof do not conflict with, result in any breach of any
of the terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time) a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Depositor, or any indenture,
agreement or other instrument to which the Depositor is a party or
by which it is bound; nor result in the creation or
 
6


imposition of any Lien upon any of its
properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, agreement
or other instrument (other than pursuant to the Basic Documents);
nor violate any law or, to the best of the Depositor’s
knowledge, any order, rule or regulation applicable to the
Depositor of any court or of any Federal or State regulatory body,
administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having
jurisdiction over the Depositor or its properties.

of the Certificate . Concurrently with the initial sale of the
Receivables to the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the initial Certificate Balance
to be executed on behalf of the Trust, authenticated and delivered
to the Depositor. The Certificate shall not entitle its holder to
any benefit under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose,
unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A,
executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s
authentication agent, by manual signature; such authentication
shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. The
Certificate shall be dated the date of its
authentication.

SECTION 3.04 Exchange of the
Certificate . The Certificate Registrar shall keep or
cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to
Section 3.08, a Certificate Register in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Owner Trustee shall
provide for the registration of the Certificate and of exchanges of
the Certificate as herein provided. Wells Fargo Delaware Trust
Company, N.A. shall be the initial Certificate
Registrar.

At the option of the
Certificateholder, the Certificate may be exchanged for other
Certificates of authorized denominations of a like aggregate amount
upon surrender of the Certificate to be exchanged at the office or
agency maintained pursuant to Section 3.08.
 
7



Every Certificate presented or
surrendered for exchange shall be accompanied by a written
instrument of exchange in a form satisfactory to the Owner Trustee
and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the
Certificateholder or its attorney duly authorized in
writing. Each Certificate surrendered for registration of
exchange shall be cancelled and subsequently disposed of by the
Owner Trustee in accordance with its customary practice.

No service charge shall be made for
any registration of transfer or exchange of the Certificate, but
the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the
Certificate.

No transfer of a Certificate or any
interest therein shall be made unless the holder of such
Certificate shall have first surrendered such Certificate to the
Certificate Registrar for registration of transfer, or if such
Certificate shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen,
the holder of such Certificate shall first comply with Section 3.05
hereof.

SECTION 3.05 Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificate . If (a) any
mutilated Certificate shall be surrendered to the Certificate
Registrar, or if the Certificate Registrar shall receive evidence
to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Certificate and (b) there shall be delivered to the
Certificate Registrar and the Owner Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them harmless,
then in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been
acquired by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee on behalf of
the Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee, or the Owner
Trustee’s authenticating agent, shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for, or in lieu of, any such mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like
tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section, the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant
to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an
ownership interest in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether
or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at
any time.

SECTION 3.06 Persons Deemed
Owners . The Owner Trustee or the Certificate Registrar or
any Paying Agent may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate
shall be registered in the Certificate Register as the owner of
such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions
pursuant to Section 5.02 and for all other purposes
whatsoever, and none of the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar or any Paying Agent shall be bound by any notice to the
contrary.

SECTION 3.07 Access to
Certificateholder’s Name and Address . The Owner
Trustee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Servicer and
the Depositor, within 15 days after receipt by the Owner Trustee of
a request therefor from the Servicer or the Depositor in writing,
the name and address of the Certificateholder as of the most recent
Record Date.

SECTION 3.08 Maintenance of
Office or Agency . The Owner Trustee shall maintain an
office or offices or agency or agencies where the Certificate may
be surrendered for registration of exchange and where notices and
demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the Certificate
and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner Trustee
initially
 
8


designates the Corporate Trust Office as its
office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor and to the Certificateholder of any
change in the location of the Certificate Register or any such
office or agency.

SECTION 3.09 Appointment of
Paying Agent . The Paying Agent shall make distributions
to the Certificateholder from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.02 and shall report the amounts of such
distributions to the Owner Trustee. Any Paying Agent shall
have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate
Distribution Account for the purpose of making the distributions
referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such power and
remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee determines in its sole
discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The
Paying Agent shall initially be Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company,
N.A., and any co-paying agent chosen by the Paying Agent and
acceptable to the Owner Trustee. The Paying Agent shall be
permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days’ written
notice to the Owner Trustee and the Depositor. In the event that
Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. shall no longer be the
Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as
Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Owner
Trustee shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional
Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver
to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which such successor Paying
Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Owner Trustee
that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional
Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to
the Certificateholder in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholder until such sums shall be paid to the
Certificateholder. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed
funds to the Owner Trustee (subject to applicable escheatment laws)
and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also
return all funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The
provisions of Sections 7.01, 7.03, 7.04, 8.01 and 8.02 shall apply
to the Owner Trustee or any affiliate thereof also in its role as
Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar for so long as the Owner
Trustee or any affiliate thereof shall act as Paying Agent or
Certificate Registrar, and to the extent applicable, to any other
paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement
to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the
context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.10 Depositor as
Certificateholder . On the Closing Date, the Depositor shall
acquire the Certificate representing 100% of the initial
Certificate Balance and, thereafter, shall retain beneficial and
record ownership of the Certificate representing 100% of the
Certificate Balance. Any attempted transfer of any Certificate that
would reduce such interest of the Depositor below 100% of the
Certificate Balance shall be void. The Owner Trustee shall cause
any Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stating
“THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE”.

SECTION 3.11
Non-transferability of the Certificate(s) . To the
fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Certificate(s) is (are) not transferable and
shall remain registered in the name of John Deere Receivables,
Inc.

SECTION 3.12 Regarding the
Certificate(s) . Each Certificateholder, by its acceptance
of a Certificate issued hereunder, represents that it has,
independently and without reliance on the Owner Trustee or any
other Person, and based on such documents and
 
9


information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own investment decision in respect of the Certificate. Each
Certificateholder also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance on the Owner Trustee or any other Person, and
based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Trust Agreement and in
connection with the Certificate. Except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Certificateholders by the Owner Trustee hereunder, the Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any
Certificateholder with any other information concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Trust, the Depositor or any
other parties hereto or to any related documents which may come
into the possession of the Owner Trustee or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives or
attorneys-in-fact.

Documents or would be contrary to Section 2.03 nor shall the
Owner Trustee be obligated to follow any such direction, if
given.

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS;
CERTAIN DUTIES

SECTION 5.01 Establishment
of Trust Account . The Owner Trustee, for the benefit of the
Certificateholder, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Trust an Eligible Deposit Account (the “Certificate
Distribution Account”), bearing a designation clearly
indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the
benefit of the Certificateholder.

The Owner Trustee shall possess all
right, title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time
in the Certificate Distribution Account and in all proceeds
thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Certificate
Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Owner Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholder. If, at any time, the Certificate
Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the
Owner Trustee (or the Depositor on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if
the Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner
Trustee or an affiliate thereof) shall within 10 Business Days
following notification of such occurrence (or such longer period,
not to exceed 30 calendar days, as to which the Rating Agency
Condition is satisfied) establish a new Certificate Distribution
Account as an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash
and/or any investments to such new Certificate Distribution
Account.

SECTION 5.02 Application of
Trust Funds .

(a) On each Payment Date, the Paying
Agent will distribute to the Certificateholder amounts deposited in
the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant to Sections 5.04 and
5.05 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement on such Payment
Date.
 
11



(b) On each Payment Date, the Owner
Trustee shall send to the Certificateholder the statement provided
to the Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 5.06(a) of the Sale and Servicing Agreement on such
Payment Date.

(c) Any Certificateholder shall be
required to deliver to the Paying Agent, the Depositor and the
Trust prior to the first Payment Date and at any time or times
required by applicable law, (i) a correct, complete and properly
executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,
W-8ECI, W-8IMY or W-8EXP (with appropriate attachments), as
applicable and (ii) any documentation that is required under FATCA
or is otherwise necessary (in the sole determination of the Trust,
the Depositor, the Paying Agent or other agent of the Trust, as
applicable), to enable the Trust, the Depositor, the Paying Agent
and any other agent of the Trust to determine their duties and
liabilities with respect to any taxes they may be required to
withhold pursuant to such Code sections in respect of such
Certificate or the Certificateholder of such Certificate or
beneficial interest therein. In addition, each holder of a
Certificate will be deemed to understand that the Paying Agent has
the right to withhold on amounts payable with respect to the
Certificate or beneficial interest therein. In addition, each
holder of a Certificate will be deemed to understand that the
Paying Agent has the right to withhold on amounts payable with
respect to the Certificate (without any corresponding gross-up) if
required. The Depositor hereby covenants with the Paying Agent that
the Depositor will use reasonable efforts to provide the Paying
Agent with sufficient information so as to enable the Paying Agent
to determine whether or not the Paying Agent is obliged to make any
FATCA withholding tax in respect of any payments with respect to a
Certificate (and if applicable, to use reasonable efforts to
provide the necessary detailed information to effectuate the FATCA
withholding tax, such as setting forth applicable amounts to be
withheld).

SECTION 5.03 Method of
Payment . Subject to Section 9.01(c), distributions
required to be made to the Certificateholder on any Payment Date
shall be made to the Certificateholder of record on the preceding
Record Date either by wire transfer, in immediately available
funds, to the account of the Certificateholder at a bank or other
entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if the
Certificateholder shall have provided to the Certificate Registrar
appropriate written instructions at least five Business Days prior
to such Payment Date or, if not, by check mailed to the
Certificateholder at the address of the Certificateholder appearing
in the Certificate Register.

SECTION 5.04 No Segregation
of Monies; No Interest . Subject to Sections 5.01 and
5.02, monies received by the Owner Trustee hereunder need not be
segregated in any manner except to the extent required by law or
the Sale and Servicing Agreement and may be deposited under such
general conditions as may be prescribed by law, and the Owner
Trustee shall not be liable for any interest thereon.

SECTION 5.05 Accounting and
Reports to the Owner, the Internal Revenue Service and Others
.

(a) The Owner Trustee shall
(a) maintain (or cause to be maintained) the books of the
Trust on a fiscal year basis ending October 31 (or such other
period as may be required by applicable law), with the first year
being a short year ending October 31, 2016, and on the accrual
method of accounting, (b) deliver to the Owner, as may be
required by the Code and
 
12


applicable Treasury Regulations, such
information as may be required to enable the Owner to prepare its
federal and state income tax returns, (c) file such tax
returns relating to the Trust as directed by the Owner and make
such elections as directed by the Owner as may from time to time be
required or appropriate under any applicable State or federal
statute or rule or regulation thereunder so as to maintain the
Trust’s characterization as disregarded as a separate entity
from the Owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
(d) in the event that during its term the Trust has more than
one beneficial owner or member as determined for such purposes,
deliver to each beneficial owner or member and file such returns as
directed by the Owner to treat the Trust as a
partnership.

(b) By acceptance of its ownership
interest in the Certificate, each beneficial owner agrees that in
the event that the Trust is classified as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes, the Depositor, for as long as it is the Owner,
and thereafter, the largest percentage beneficial owner of the
Certificate, shall be the “tax matters partner” of the
Trust pursuant to the Code. If the Trust is classified as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes (i) for any taxable
period beginning before December 31, 2017, the “tax matters
partner” shall represent the Trust in connection with all
examinations of the Trust’s affairs by tax authorities,
including resulting judicial and administrative proceedings, and
(ii) for any taxable period beginning after December 31, 2017, the
“tax matters partner” shall be designated as the
“partnership representative” within the meaning of
Section 6223 of the Code (as amended by P.L. 114-74, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015) and the Trust will, to the extent practicable,
make the election described in Section 6226 of the Code (as amended
by P.L. 114-74, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015). Finally,
if the Trust is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, the Trust will not elect to apply Section 6221-6241 of
the Code (as amended by P.L. 114-74, the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2015) to any taxable period of the Trust beginning before December
31, 2017.

ARTICLE VI

AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OWNER
TRUSTEE

SECTION 6.01 General
Authority . The Owner Trustee is authorized and directed to
execute and deliver the Basic Documents to which the Trust is to be
a party and each certificate or other document attached as an
exhibit to or contemplated by the Basic Documents to which the
Trust is to be a party, or any amendment thereto or other
agreement, in each case, in such form as the Depositor shall
approve as evidenced conclusively by the delivery of such
certificates and documents to the Owner Trustee for the Owner
Trustee’s execution thereof. In addition to the foregoing,
the Owner Trustee is authorized, but shall not be obligated, to
take all actions required of the Trust pursuant to the Basic
Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized from time to
time to take such action as the Administrator directs in writing
with respect to the Basic Documents and shall, upon the written
direction of the Administrator, execute and deliver any amendments
to this Agreement or any Basic Documents presented by the
Administrator for execution and delivery by the Owner
Trustee.
 
13



SECTION 6.02 General
Duties . It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to
discharge (or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Basic Documents and
to administer the Trust in the interest of the Owner, subject to
the Basic Documents and in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee
shall be deemed to have discharged its duties and responsibilities
hereunder and under the Basic Documents to the extent the
Administrator has agreed in the Administration Agreement to perform
any act or to discharge any duty of the Owner Trustee hereunder or
under any Basic Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
for the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its
obligations under the Administration Agreement.

SECTION 6.03 Action upon
Instruction .

(a) Subject to Article IV, the
Owner may, by written instruction, direct the Owner Trustee in the
management of the Trust. Such direction may be exercised at
any time by written instruction of the Owner pursuant to
Article IV.

(b) The Owner Trustee shall not be
required to take any action hereunder or under any Basic Document
if the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined, or shall
have been advised by counsel, that such action is likely to result
in liability on the part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the
terms hereof or of any Basic Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Basic Document, the
Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form as shall be
appropriate under the circumstances) to the Owner requesting
instruction as to the course of action to be adopted, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts in good faith in accordance with any
written instruction of the Owner received, the Owner Trustee shall
not be liable on account of such action to any Person. If the
Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction
within ten days of such notice (or within such shorter period of
time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be
necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no
duty to, take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent
with this Agreement or the Basic Documents, as it shall deem to be
in the best interest of the Owner, and shall have no liability to
any Person for such action or inaction.

(d) In the event that the Owner
Trustee is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Basic Document or any such provision is ambiguous
as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in conflict with
any other applicable provision, or in the event that this Agreement
permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is silent or is
incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner Trustee is
required to take with respect to a particular set of facts, the
Owner Trustee may give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate
under the circumstances) to the Owner requesting written
instruction and, to the extent that the Owner Trustee acts or
refrains from acting in good faith in accordance with any such
written instruction received, the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable, on account of such action or inaction, to any
Person. If the Owner Trustee shall not have received
appropriate written instruction within 10 days of such notice (or
within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified
in such
 
14


notice or may be necessary under the
circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or
refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement or the Basic Documents, as it shall deem to be in the
best interests of the Owner, and shall have no liability to any
Person for such action or inaction.

SECTION 6.04 No Duties
Except as Specified in This Agreement or in Instructions
. The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, make any payment with respect to, register, record, sell,
dispose of, or otherwise deal with the Owner Trust Estate, or to
otherwise take or refrain from taking any action under, or in
connection with, any document contemplated hereby to which the
Owner Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms
of this Agreement or in any document or written instruction
received by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.03; and no
implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or
any Basic Document against the Owner Trustee.

The Owner Trustee shall have no
responsibility for the preparation, correctness, accuracy,
existence, validity or perfection of any financing statement or for
filing any financing or continuation statement in any public office
at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of
any security interest or lien granted to it hereunder or to prepare
or file any Securities and Exchange Commission filing for the Trust
or to record this Agreement or any Basic Document. The Owner
Trustee nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge
any liens on any part of the Owner Trust Estate that result from
actions by, or claims against, the Owner Trustee that are not
related to the ownership or the admi
