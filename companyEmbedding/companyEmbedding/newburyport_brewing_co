Bill & Chris‚Äô Excellent Adventure
We brew great beer, play in an 8-piece funk band and love adventure. A few years ago while watching the Bruins win the Stanley Cup we decided to share our passions with the world by creating the Newburyport Brewing Company. Our brand is based on three things‚Ä¶ Using the best ingredients in the world to brew amazing beer, sharing Newburyport and its rich seaport history (the Coast Guard was founded here), and going on adventures with great beer in a can.
And music. We play it. We love it. And by the way, there‚Äôs a stage at our brewery for up and coming local bands to some of the world‚Äôs finest to jam.
View the current month‚Äôs lineup!













Mike Robinson, Brewmaster
Mike is an award-winning brewer with 17 years professional and amateur brewing experience. Plus, he makes a hell of a homemade hot sauce and is an all-around good dude. Mike‚Äôs accolades include:

19-time medalist at the Masters Championship of Amateur Brewing
2009 Sam Adams Longshot winner, chosen over 1,300 entrants
2008 Sam Adams Longshot finalist
3-time Sam Adams Patriot finalist
New England Home Brewer of the Year

ON DRAUGHT NOW: JOPPA GRANDE ‚Ä¢ DOUBLE IPA



























¬†¬†¬†¬†















¬†
All of our beer styles are brewed with domestic and international premium base malts including Crisp Maris Otter, Franco Belge Pilsen, and specialty malts from Briess. The Maris Otter variety of barley has long been the favorite of the English brewers for its rich flavor which enables us to make American-style beers with an underlying English malt backbone. Our Pilsen malt gives our witbier that characteristically mild Belgian-style sweet taste and aroma found in other world-class Belgian beers. Rounded off with top-shelf loose hops including Citra, Topaz, Centennial, Amarillo and Cascade, each beer features a unique balance of hop tastes and aromas.























A refreshing session IPA shining with Citra and Amarillo hops uniquely balanced by malt sweetness for a crisp, easy finish. a tasty way to kick back and melt away.




















 An unfiltered witbier with hints of citrus & coriander. This "partly cloudy" ale features slight citrus and spicy aromas complemented by mild sweet pilsner and wheat malt tastes. Our friends in Belgium would be proud of us.




















A well-balanced beer for smooth sailing. Refreshing, lightly carbonated and slightly citrus-y with a light toasted sweet malt finish. If you‚Äôre looking for a drinkable, flavorful ale, rope up to the bollards and enjoy.




















An assertive and hoppy west coast-style India Pale Ale. Bright hop aromas and flavors fade to a brief, smooth malt undertone and a clean, crisp, slightly bitter finish. This beer is brewed to bite you back!

Newburyport Brewing to distribute throughout Massachusetts

The¬†Newburyport Brewing Co., Massachusetts‚Äô only all-can and keg craft brewery, announced statewide distribution by the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance starting this month. The company will be shipping its three¬†initial beer styles ‚Äî Plum Island Belgian White, Newburyport Pale Ale, and Green Head IPA.
Newburyport Brewing is ready to ship its three premier brews throughout Massachusetts
The Newburyport Brewing Co. is a privately held craft brewery founded way back in 2012 by two local Newburyport entrepreneurs, musicians and home brewers, Chris Webb and Bill Fisher. ¬†The Alliance‚Äôs network consists of five wholesale partners covering the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts ‚Äì Atlas Distributing Inc., Burke Distributing, Colonial Wholesale Beverage, Commercial Distributing Company and Merrimack Valley Distributing Co.
‚ÄúThe Massachusetts Beverage Alliance is pumped to be partnering with the great folks at the Newburyport Brewing Co.,‚Äù said Brian Murphy, director of sales and marketing at Massachusetts Beverage Alliance.¬†‚ÄúBeing the first Massachusetts can and keg microbrewery is a very attractive attribute to any distributor.¬†With a brick-and-mortar brewery and plenty of capacity and square footage to scale operations to meet long-term demand on top of that, Newburyport Brewing is an ideal addition to our portfolio.¬† However,¬†Bill and Chris‚Äôs¬†passion,¬†dedication to product quality and consistency, and business acumen make us truly believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to do something special here.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur partnership with the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance allows us to deliver the freshest, highest-quality beer products to bars, restaurants, retailers, and ultimately, our consumers,‚Äù said Fisher, co-founder and chief operations officer.¬†¬†‚ÄúWe chose the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance for its dedication to craft brewers, excellent customer service, and long track record of distribution success.‚Äù
As Newburyport Brewing continues to ramp up production to build inventory, the company will initially offer its three products on tap in half-barrel and sixth-barrel kegs at bars and restaurants in Essex County and greater Boston.¬†Sales of 12-ounce cans will begin in early April and the company will expand availability of its products statewide thereafter.
‚ÄúWe are dedicated to quality and consistency for all of our craft beer products,‚Äù said Chris Webb, co-founder and chief executive officer. ‚ÄúTo ensure that our beers reach consumers at the peak of freshness, we are working closely with our team of distributors to enforce an enjoy-by date that will be included on all cans.¬† Cans are inherently better equipped to protect beer from light and oxygen degradation and preserve each beer‚Äôs taste and aroma.‚Äù

						Newburyport, MA (March 2013) - The Newburyport Brewing Company‚Ñ¢, Massachusetts' only all-can and keg craft brewery, announced today that statewide distribution of its three  initial beer styles -- Plum Island Belgian White, Newburyport Pale Ale, and Green Head IPA -- will be distributed by Massachusetts Beverage Alliance beginning in March 2013.  The Alliance's network consists of five wholesale partners covering the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts ‚Äì Atlas Distributing Inc., Burke Distributing, Colonial Wholesale Beverage, Commercial Distributing Company and Merrimack Valley Distributing Company.

"The Massachusetts Beverage Alliance is pumped to be partnering with the great folks at the Newburyport Brewing Company,‚Äù says Brian Murphy, director of sales and marketing at Massachusetts Beverage Alliance.  ‚ÄúBeing the first Massachusetts can and keg microbrewery is a very attractive attribute to any distributor.  With a brick-and-mortar brewery and plenty of capacity and square footage to scale operations to meet long-term demand on top of that, Newburyport Brewing is an ideal addition to our portfolio.  However, Bill and Chris's passion, dedication to product quality and consistency, and business acumen make us truly believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to do something special here.‚Äù

"Our partnership with the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance allows us to deliver the freshest, highest-quality beer products to bars, restaurants, retailers, and ultimately, our consumers," says Bill Fisher, co-founder and chief operations officer.  "We chose the Massachusetts Beverage Alliance for their dedication to craft brewers, excellent customer service, and long track record of distribution success."

As Newburyport Brewing continues to ramp up production to build inventory, the Company will initially offer its three products on tap ‚Äì Newburyport Pale Ale, Green Head IPA, and Plum Island Belgian White ‚Äì in half-barrel and sixth-barrel kegs at bars and restaurants in Essex County and greater Boston.  Sales of 12-ounce cans will begin in early April and the Company will expand availability of its products statewide thereafter.

‚ÄúWe are dedicated to quality and consistency for all of our craft beer products,‚Äù explains Chris Webb, co-founder and chief executive officer. ‚ÄúTo ensure that our beers reach consumers at the peak of freshness, we are working closely with our team of distributors to enforce an enjoy-by date that will be included on all cans.  Cans are inherently better equipped to protect beer from light and oxygen degradation and preserve each beer‚Äôs taste and aroma.‚Äù

						So this is at least the second PR from these guys on BA describing the business side of their operation.

Has anyone tried their beer?

Newburyport Brewing Co. Is Doubling Down on Production Capacity

By Alex E. Weaver -   April 7, 2015

Newburyport Brewing Company, circa 2013.
A couple years back, I had the privilege of brewing a custom BostInno beer at Newburyport Brewing Company. There, in the nondescript brewery run by Bill Fisher and Chris Webb, were palates and palates of beer, stacked floor to ceiling with more being brewed all the time. They were struggling to keep up with demand; a great problem for any craft brewery. But a problem nonetheless.
Come ahead to 2015, and things are looking up. The brewery, founded in 2012, announced Tuesday it will be doubling its onsite production capacity to more than 15,000 barrels per year. The expansion is expected to be completed by early April.
‚ÄúWe again thank our local craft beer-loving consumers, bar and restaurant owners, retail owners, and musicians throughout the region for an incredible second year in business,‚Äù said Chris Webb, co-founder and CEO. ‚ÄúDuring the past two years, we have proven our commitment to producing consistently fresh, high quality craft beers and are excited to offer more innovative products across the region as we expand our production capacity.‚Äù
Newburyport Brewing Company, which only distributes in cans and kegs, announced recently a partnership with Delta Air Lines to include its pale ale on Northeast Regional Shuttle flights. The brewery‚Äôs second year in business marked several other milestones as well: expanded distribution to New Hampshire; Green Head IPA being recognized by CBS as one of the state‚Äôs best canned beers; and the continued commitment to supporting hundreds of local charitable events and causes.
What‚Äôs more, the next stage of growth has been partially funded by a $280,000 MassDevelopment Equipment Loan as part of the state‚Äôs finance and development agency‚Äôs push to stimulate economic growth across Massachusetts.
‚ÄúRegional community support has been phenomenal and we enjoy giving back to say ‚Äòthank you‚Äô whenever we can,‚Äù said co-founder and COO Bill Fisher.
The brewery, located a couple miles from downtown, is unassuming from the outside, but a beer-drinker‚Äôs and music-lover‚Äôs delight from within. A sampling room, complete with a foosball table and a stage for live music, welcomes guests Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
New England is home to 15 Regional Breweries ‚Äì including Newburyport Brewing Co. under its new output ‚Äì classified as those that produce between 15,000 and 6,000,000 barrels annually.
