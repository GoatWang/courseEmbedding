FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Drillship
Drillships are self-propelled ships equipped for drilling. They keep station over the well by means of a computer-controlled thruster system known as dynamic positioning. Drillships operate in water depths in which jack-ups rigs are incapable of working and can drill in deep and ultra-deep waters.









Semi-submersibles
Semi-submersible rigs consist of a deck containing the working areas and equipment and the living quarters, supported by a hull which consists of vertical columns connected to horizontal pontoons. Such rigs operate in a 'semi-submerged' position, with the lower hull ballasted down below the waterline. In the case of a dynamically-positioned (DP) semisub, the rig keeps station over the wellhead location by means of a computer-controlled thruster system. In the semi-submerged position, it provides a stable platform for drilling, due in part to its wave transparency characteristics at the water line. The 'generation' to which a semi sub belongs is often given - this indicates the period when the rig was built and, to a certain extent, its water depth and deck-load capabilities. The latest rigs are sixth-generation. A semi-submersible rig with DP capability can drill in conventional, deep and ultra-deep waters.

The latest rigs are sixth-generation. A semi-submersible rig with DP capability can drill in conventional, deep and ultra-deep waters.









Jack-up
Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with tubular structure legs that are lowered to the sea floor. Tugboats tow a jack-up rig to the drill-site as a vessel, with its hull riding the sea and its leg raised. At the drill-site, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues until the hull is elevated above the surface of the water. Drilling operations can then begin. When they are completed, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water, the legs are raised and the rig can be relocated to another drill-site.









Tender rig
Self-erecting tender rigs allow for drilling operations to be performed from a wellhead platform without the need for a permanently installed drilling package. The tender is moored next to the platform where wells are to be drilled and the modularised drilling package is lifted onto the platform. Drilling operations are supported by facilities on the tender, including storage for drilling supplies, power generation facilities for running the drilling equipment and well completion equipment. The tender also has living quarters and a helicopter deck. Tender rigs are either barge-based or have semi-submersible hulls. Both carry the same equipment, but the semi-submersible rig is able to operate in rougher weather conditions.

We are a limited liability company formed by Seadrill Limited (NYSE: SDRL) to own, operate and acquire offshore drilling rigs. Our drilling rigs are under long-term contracts with major oil companies such as Chevron, Total, BP and ExxonMobil.
We also intend to leverage the relationships, expertise and reputation of Seadrill to re-contract our fleet under long-term contracts. Seadrill is one of the world's largest international offshore drilling contractors, and we believe Seadrill will be motivated to facilitate our growth because of its significant ownership interest in us.
