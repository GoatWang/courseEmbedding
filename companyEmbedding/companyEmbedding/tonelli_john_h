John H Tonelli
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Rhode Island:













Does John H Tonelli carry a valid contracting license?



All contractors in Rhode Island must register with the Contractors Registration Board to repair or remodel single-family to four-family dwellings within the state.











How important is contractor licensing in Rhode Island?



Contractors in the state of Rhode Island must complete 5 hours of continuing education prior to registering.











Your liability risk when hiring John H Tonelli



Registered contractors must obtain a general liability insurance policy, but are not required to carry workers' compensation. It is a good idea to only hire contractors with general liability and workers' compensation insurance, request copies of certificates for both policies before any work begins.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Rhode Island, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
