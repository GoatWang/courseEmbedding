AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the
“ Agreement ”), dated as of June 24, 2014,
pursuant to Section 251 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the “ DGCL ”), by and among
ADEPTUS HEALTH INC., a Delaware corporation (the “ Adeptus
Corp ”), SCP III AIV THREE-FCER
BLOCKER, INC., a Delaware corporation (the “
Blocker ”) and solely for purposes of
Section 10 hereof,
SCP III AIV THREE-FCER CONDUIT, L.P. (the
“ Blocker Owner ”).

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of
directors of each of Adeptus Corp and Blocker have resolved that
Blocker should merge (the “ Merger ”) with and
into Adeptus Corp with Adeptus Corp being the surviving corporation
in connection with the initial public offering and sale of shares
of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“
Class A Common Stock ”), of Adeptus Corp as
contemplated by Adeptus Corp’s Registration Statement on
Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-196142) (the “
IPO ”);

 

WHEREAS, both the sole stockholder
of Adeptus Corp, Adeptus Health LLC (“ Adeptus LLC
”), and the stockholder of the Blocker, the Blocker Owner,
have approved the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Blocker holds limited
liability company units in Adeptus LLC and the transfer of such
limited liability company units in connection with the Merger has
been approved in accordance with the terms of the Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Adeptus LLC, dated
June 24, 2014, among the Blocker and the other parties thereto
(which agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety in
connection with the IPO);

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the IPO,
the Blocker Owner and Adeptus Corp, among other parties, are
entering into a Stockholders’ Agreement, Registration Rights
Agreement and Tax Receivable Agreement, each dated on or about the
date hereof;

 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for
United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify
as a “reorganization” under the provisions of
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “ Code ”), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder; and

 

WHEREAS, Adeptus Corp and the
Blocker desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual covenants and undertakings contained herein and for good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto prescribe the terms and
conditions of the Merger and mode of carrying the same into effect
as follows:

 

AGREEMENT

 

1.                                   
Merger . Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined), the Blocker shall be merged with and into Adeptus Corp,
and the separate legal existence of the Blocker shall thereupon
cease. Adeptus Corp shall be the surviving entity (sometimes
referred to herein as the “ Surviving Corporation
”), and the separate legal existence of Adeptus Corp with all
its right, privileges, immunities and powers shall continue
unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL.

 

2.                                   
Cancellation of Shares; Merger
Consideration . At the
Effective Time, (i) the Blocker Owner shall receive for each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of Blocker (each,
a

 






 
“ Blocker Share ”)
(A) 4,518,275 shares of Class A Common Stock and
(B) the right to receive any amounts due pursuant to the TRA
(as defined below) if and when such amounts become due in the
future (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the “
Merger Consideration ”), and (ii) each Blocker
Share which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Blocker Owner, be automatically
cancelled. The Blocker Shares so cancelled shall cease to exist,
and the Blocker Owner shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such Blocker Shares, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration for each Blocker Share outstanding at the
Effective Time.

 

3.                                   
Effective Time
. Upon the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions below, Adeptus Corp shall cause a certificate of
merger to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective
on the date of consummation of the IPO as specified in such
certificate of merger (the “ Effective Time ”).
References to the Blocker or Adeptus Corp after the Effective Time
shall mean the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.                                   
Certificate of Incorporation;
Bylaws; Board of Directors . The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
Adeptus Corp, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
(in each case, as the same may have been amended or restated
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time), shall
be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case until duly amended as provided therein or
by applicable law. The board of directors of Adeptus Corp
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have
been duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal.

 

5.                                   
Conditions Necessary for
Effectiveness of the Merger . The satisfaction or waiver of the following
conditions shall be necessary to the effectiveness of the
Merger:

 

(a)                                 
the delivery for filing of the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Adeptus Corp
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the effectiveness
thereof;

 

(b)                                 
the execution and delivery of the
underwriting agreement relating to the IPO among Adeptus Corp,
Adeptus LLC, the Blocker Owner and the underwriters of the IPO
(which shall not have been terminated prior to the Effective
Time);

 

(c)                                  
the effectiveness of the Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Adeptus LLC;
and

 

(d)                                 
the execution of the Tax Receivable
Agreement between Adeptus Corp, the Blocker Owner and other parties
thereto (the “ TRA ”).

 

6.                                   
Plan of Reorganization
. This Agreement is intended to
constitute and is hereby adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) of the United States
Treasury Regulations. From and after the date of this Agreement and
until the Effective Time, each party to this Agreement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and
shall not, without the prior written consent of the parties to this
Agreement, knowingly take any actions or cause any actions to be
taken which could prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Assuming the consummation of the IPO, following the
Effective Time, and consistent with any such consent, neither
Adeptus Corp nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, shall
knowingly take any action or cause any action to be taken which
would cause the Merger to fail to so qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code.
