What is TEP e-bill?


TEP e-bill is a convenient, free service that enables you to securely receive, view and pay your TEP bill online.
Once enrolled in TEP e-bill your bills are delivered online, with notification via email. The bill looks like the familiar paper version, and links are provided to our website so that you receive all of the same communications as offline customers, but in a digital format. You can view and pay your bill online anytime, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You decide when and how to pay, and which bank or savings account you want your payment to be deducted from.




What is My Account?


My Account provides secure, free access to your account information and related services, such as TEP e-bill. Security is the key. Your information is kept private and encrypted. By using a login and password, only you have access to that information, and only you can make changes.
TEP e-bill is powered by Kubra, a leader in online billing. TEP e-bill and Kubra have strict privacy policies and use the industry standard in security protection.
When you log in to TEP e-bill from the tep.com home page, your e-mail address and password are transmitted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your personal information before it leaves your computer, ensuring that no one else can read it.




How secure is my bill payment and personal information?


TEP e-bill is powered by Kubra, a leader in online billing. TEP e-bill and Kubra have strict privacy policies and use the industry standard in security protection.




Why do I need an email address and password to access my account?


Your email address and password protect the confidentiality of your account and enable us to verify your identity. To maintain the security and privacy of your account, choose a password that others can't guess but is easy for you to remember. Your password must be between 6 and 8 characters.




Who do I contact if I forget my email address or password?


Click here to recover your email address or password.




How do I sign up for TEP e-bill?


The first step is to access your account using My Account. During the enrollment process, you'll enter information about your account. You will need to refer to a current bill to register. Then with a few more clicks, you'll be ready to pay your bill online.




What information do I need to enroll in e-bill?


Enroll by clicking here. To make signing up easier, have the following information available:

A recent bill showing your account number and billing address
Bank account number from which your payments will be deducted
Bank routing number (we'll show you how to find this number on your checks)
Valid email address*

After you enroll in TEP e-bill, you will receive an email with a link when your bill is ready to view and pay online.




How do I access 24 months of my billing history?


We'll store your TEP billing and payment records in one paperless, convenient e-file, beginning with the month you make your first payment using TEP e-bill. After two years of using TEP e-bill, 24 months of your payment records will be in your online account, which you can access anytime, anywhere. Additionally, My Account displays your most recent 12 months of bills and power usage.




Will I continue to receive a paper bill from Tucson Electric Power?


After enrolling in TEP e-bill, your bills are delivered online, with notification via email. In some cases, you will receive one more paper bill in the mail before being switched to e-billing exclusively. Every month, you'll receive an email notification with the necessary link when your current e-bill is available for viewing and paying online. Your bill notification will be sent to the email address that you used to register with My Account. Be sure to update your email address by clicking the email link on the Account Information page of My Account if you switch your Internet Service Provider (ISP).




I filed my e-bill before I paid it. How can I now view or pay it?


When you file e-bills they are removed from your active e-bills list. To retrieve filed e-bills, log into My Account and navigate to the Billing & Payment tab located at the top of My Account. Within the Billing & Payment section, navigate to the left-side section links and click on Filed Bills.




My first e-bill is a TEP bill I have already paid. What should I do?


Your first e-bill will be the TEP statement for the current billing cycle. Depending on when you sent your payment in the mail, your first e-bill statement may not reflect this payment. If you have already paid the bill for the current month, click the file button to have your e-bill stored in your e-file. You will receive an email notification when your next bill is ready to view and pay online.




Can I pay by credit card with TEP e-bill?


With TEP e-bill, you can make payments from any type of bank account, such as a checking or savings account. If you wish to pay your TEP bill by credit card, you may do so through our third-party processing site or by calling 1-800-650-9138. The processing company will charge you a fee for this service. Only TEP e-bill provides free payment services – credit card payments incur a convenience fee.




If TEP e-bill is free, why is there a convenience fee for credit card payments?


Credit card payments are processed by a third-party vendor that charges a convenience fee on each transaction. TEP does not receive any portion of the fee charged for credit card payments. Credit card payments are a separate service from TEP e-bill, which allows you to pay your monthly bill electronically using your checking or savings account, free of charge.




How long does it take for my payment to be credited to my account?


Please allow at least two business days for your payment to be credited to your account.




I want to continue to pay my bill through Auto Pay (direct debit). Can I still sign up to receive e-bills and eliminate paper bills?


Yes, you have the option to sign up to receive your TEP bill online but continue to pay by Auto Pay. By registering with My Account, you can choose to add the convenience of receiving and viewing your bill online with TEP e-bill. You will no longer receive a paper TEP bill in the mail. Instead, you'll receive an email notification with the bill amount and date your payment will be deducted from your bank account. The email notification will also provide a link to view your entire e-bill at tep.com. There is no need to pay online as this will result in duplicate payments.




Why can't I just view my bill or account information?


A summary of your account information is available through My Account. Registering for My Account allows you to log in to a secure area and view up-to-date information about your account. To view an online version of your printed bill, you will need to enroll in TEP e-bill, which allows you to receive, view and pay your bill electronically. If you enroll in TEP e-bill, you will no longer receive a printed bill in the mail.

Total Rewards: More than just a paycheck
Our Total Rewards program includes compensation and recognition programs designed to reward your performance, tools to help you plan your financial future and benefits and services for your whole family. 
 





Employee Benefits


Our employee benefits program is designed to provide a choice of coverage levels and options in several benefit areas. Employees receive Benefit Dollars that apply toward the cost of benefit elections. These dollars represent the funds that TEP contributes towards medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability benefits. Employees use these dollars to create the benefit package that is best for them.
Employee options include:

Medical
Employee Life Insurance
Dental
Spouse & Dependent Life Insurance
Vision
Health Care Spending Account
Long-Term Disability Insurance
Dependent Care Spending Account

Health plan options include:

PPO (preferred provider organization) insurance with an option to contribute to a Flexible Health Care Spending Account.
High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which allows you to contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) on a pre-tax basis (TEP also provides funds for the HSA).





Retirement Plan


TEP offers various defined benefit retirement plans (pension plans). TEP funds these plans without any contribution by the employee. Eligible employees automatically become a plan participant on the date that they meet the applicable eligibility criteria. Vesting (when a retirement plan is fully vested, the employee has a right to the entire amount of money in the account) occurs after five years of credited service (the amount of an employee's benefit is determined by the amount of their credited service).




401(k) Plan


The Tucson Electric Power Company 401(k) Plan includes an automatic enrollment feature that makes it easy for employees to participate.




Vacation (Paid Time Off)


Time away from work to relax and pursue special interests is important to everyone. Full-time employees earn vacation days.




Holidays


TEP is closed on several holidays each year. Business requirements, local practices and applicable collective bargaining agreements, if any, determine which holidays are recognized. Near the end of the year, TEP publishes a list of holidays that will be recognized in the next calendar year. Employees also may receive one or more floating holidays, which must be scheduled with prior approval of the employee's supervisor.




Tuition Reimbursement


Employees who have worked one full year of continuous service and who are regularly scheduled to work 32 hours or more per week are eligible to receive tuition reimbursement for an approved course of studies up to an allowable limit during the life of their career at TEP or any sister company, including UniSource Energy Services and Southwest Energy Solutions.

Take control of your electric bill by choosing the pricing plan that is right for you.
Tucson Electric Power offers four unique plans that give residential and small commercial customers the ability to reduce their bills by changing their energy usage habits. With these pricing plans, you can choose to save energy and lower your bill.
Two of the plans include time-of-use rates that offer discounts for usage during off-peak hours. And two of the plans pair reduced energy charges with a “demand” charge that rewards customers who can limit their concurrent use of large appliances during on-peak hours.
No action is required of customers who want to stay on their current pricing plan.

Tucson Electric Power provides safe, reliable power to Tucson residents - and more. We offer customers a wide range of incentivized programs to help them reduce their energy costs and build a better future.
Company overview
TEP provides the energy behind Tucson's economy. We deliver safe, reliable power to more than 417,000 customers in the Tucson metropolitan area. We’re also a local leader in community service, volunteerism and economic development efforts.
TEP and its sister company, UniSource Energy Services, are among a family of utilities owned by Fortis, Canada’s largest investor-owned gas and electric utility holding company. Fortis completed an acquisition of UNS Energy, TEP’s and UES’ parent company, in August 2014.
TEP offers comprehensive energy services through reliable, traditional resources and a growing renewable power portfolio. We also offer many ways to help our customers use energy more efficiently.
TEP's community service efforts have earned nationwide acclaim. We provide direct contributions and other support for our employees' volunteerism, encouraging a spirit of giving that is shared among the Fortis family of utilities. 
About Fortis
Fortis is the largest investor-owned electric and gas distribution utility in Canada. Its regulated utilities account for approximately 93 percent of its total assets and serve more than 3 million customers across Canada and in the United States and the Caribbean. Fortis owns non-regulated hydroelectric generation assets in Canada, Belize and Upstate New York. For more information, visit fortisinc.com.

Serving our community
We are committed to serving the needs of others
 



Tucson Electric Power and its sister company, UniSource Energy Services, work with charitable nonprofits, education and government organizations that focus on employee volunteer engagement, work toward meeting community needs, and demonstrate the viability of their programs. TEP focuses its giving in the areas of education, environmental conservation activities and community engagement, including at-risk and low-income communities, first responders and veterans.

TEP invests in the community in several ways:
Donations
Financial donations to non-profits or charities for programs or special events where volunteer assistance is not needed or would not be appropriate may be requested throughout the year.
In-kind donations
In-kind donations are non-monetary valuable goods including computer equipment, office furniture, printing (i.e. promotional material), or the lending of pop-up tents, traffic cones and more.
Corporate memberships
Corporate memberships are requests for annual membership at the corporate level to community organizations such as chambers of commerce, utility organizations and business groups.
Employee volunteer projects
Employee volunteer projects are employee-driven initiatives to support the communities where we live and work. These requests are typically supported and coordinated by Community Action Team employee volunteers.
Sponsorships
Sponsorships are the support of events and activities in which a mutually beneficial arrangement is made between the organization and TEP. This may include the promotion of goods, products and services. The organization promoting the sponsorship is responsible for providing the value of the sponsorship that is tax-deductible.
Community Impact Grants
Community Impact Grants are designed to provide a significant boost to local community assistance, education and environmental protection efforts. Our expanded grants program will provide $330,000 to nonprofit groups across Arizona in 2016.

Tucson Electric Power

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Tucson Electric Power (TEP) is an electric utility company serving southern Arizona in the United States. It is a subsidiary of Fortis, which announced its acquisition of parent company UNS Energy in 2013.[1]
Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium, a baseball stadium on Tucson's south side, was once named Tucson Electric Park for TEP.
History of Tucson Electric Power[edit]
According to historian David Leighton, of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, around 1882, Royal A. Johnson started a light plant in Tucson in order replace Tucson’s oil lamps with electric lights. His new idea received little support and his plant went belly-up after a couple years.
Frank E. "Red" Russell, an employee of the Western Union Telegraph Co., in Tucson, on occasion did repairs on the Arctic Ice Works, an ice plant that was also owned by Johnson and learned of the failed light plant a few years earlier. This association with Johnson sparked an interest in lighting Tucson.
In 1892, Russell was one of a group of individuals that came together to form the Tucson Electric Light & Power Co. which was located at 116-120 N. Church Street (now Church Ave). Russell was named the first manager-operator of this new firm and was paid $40 a month. Four years later the company purchased the Tucson Gas Company and by 1901 it was known as the Tucson Gas, Electric Light and Power Co.
In 1904 the generating facilities for the Tucson Gas, Electric Light and Power Co. were relocated to West Sixth Street, across from the Russell family home at 306 W. Sixth St. This new site would later serve as Tucson Electric Power Co.’s headquarters, from 1967 to 1999.
Note:The new Tucson Electric Power headquarters at 88 E. Broadway sits on land that was part of the ground that Russell as a Tucson City Councilman and others obtained back in 1899. [2]

Tucson Electric Power - Wikipedia





















 






Tucson Electric Power

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Tucson Electric Power (TEP) is an electric utility company serving southern Arizona in the United States. It is a subsidiary of Fortis, which announced its acquisition of parent company UNS Energy in 2013.[1]
Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium, a baseball stadium on Tucson's south side, was once named Tucson Electric Park for TEP.
History of Tucson Electric Power[edit]
According to historian David Leighton, of the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, around 1882, Royal A. Johnson started a light plant in Tucson in order replace Tucson’s oil lamps with electric lights. His new idea received little support and his plant went belly-up after a couple years.
Frank E. "Red" Russell, an employee of the Western Union Telegraph Co., in Tucson, on occasion did repairs on the Arctic Ice Works, an ice plant that was also owned by Johnson and learned of the failed light plant a few years earlier. This association with Johnson sparked an interest in lighting Tucson.
In 1892, Russell was one of a group of individuals that came together to form the Tucson Electric Light & Power Co. which was located at 116-120 N. Church Street (now Church Ave). Russell was named the first manager-operator of this new firm and was paid $40 a month. Four years later the company purchased the Tucson Gas Company and by 1901 it was known as the Tucson Gas, Electric Light and Power Co.
In 1904 the generating facilities for the Tucson Gas, Electric Light and Power Co. were relocated to West Sixth Street, across from the Russell family home at 306 W. Sixth St. This new site would later serve as Tucson Electric Power Co.’s headquarters, from 1967 to 1999.
Note:The new Tucson Electric Power headquarters at 88 E. Broadway sits on land that was part of the ground that Russell as a Tucson City Councilman and others obtained back in 1899. [2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
