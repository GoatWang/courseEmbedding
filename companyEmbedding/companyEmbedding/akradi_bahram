Bahram Akradi
Download Hi-Res
Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Bahram Akradi founded Life Time in 1992 with the mission to provide an entertaining, educational, friendly and inviting, functional and innovative experience that meets the health and fitness needs of the entire family. With unwavering commitment on the member point of view, he and Life Time have since been credited with transforming the health and fitness industry.
As the Healthy Way of Life Company, Life Time helps organizations, communities and individuals to achieve total health objectives, athletic aspirations and fitness goals by engaging in their areas of interest – or discovering new passions – both inside and outside of Life Time’s distinctive and large sports, professional fitness, family recreation and spa destinations, most of which operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Company’s holistic Healthy Way of Life approach enables customers to achieve this by providing the best places, people and programs of uncompromising quality and value.
Additionally, through Life Time’s development of best-in-class nutrition products, proprietary metabolic assessments and testing, and heart rate training protocols, personal training and nutrition consultation, the award-winning healthy lifestyle magazine,Experience Life, nationally renowned athletic events, full-service spas and cafes, and corporate wellness programs, Akradi has led the creation not of a typical “health club” or “gym” chain, but rather, a comprehensive, Healthy Way of Life Company and brand that continues to have a significant impact on the health and wellness of consumers.
Prior to launching Life Time, Akradi led the growth of Minnesota-based U.S. Swim and Fitness (formerly Nautilus Fitness Center, Inc.), of which he was part owner. It was the second-largest health club chain in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market when Akradi and his partners sold it to Bally Total Fitness in 1986. After continuing to operate the business as a division of Bally for more than two years, Akradi left the company to develop business plans and secure investors for his own company, which was established three years later. Life Time subsequently was introduced to consumers in 1992.
A native of Tehran, Iran, Akradi relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, at age 17. He began his health club career in sales at Nautilus Fitness Center while attending the University of Colorado and completing the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.

Immigrant Entrepreneur Hall of Fame: Bahram Akradi


 
Country of origin: Iran
Year came to U.S.: 1978
Education: BS Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado
Business: Life Time Fitness, Inc. (1992)
Headquarters: Chanhassen, MN
2014 revenue: $1.3 billion
North American employment:  24,000 
 

Akradi’s personal philosophy of fitness and well-being has made Life Time Fitness unique and successful.
He competes in “Leadman” triathlons, which include a 3.1-mile swim, 140-mile bike and 13.6-mile run.

 
Bahram Akradi takes fitness seriously. In fact, he takes a healthy lifestyle, a positive outlook and personal empowerment seriously. In his own words, “No matter what your goals, no matter what your personal or professional ambitions, making a conscious choice to change your life is an incredibly empowering, and incredibly challenging, thing to do.”  Akradi has embraced this challenge and helped many others do the same through Life Time Fitness.
Born in Tehran, Iran, Akradi fulfilled his boyhood dream at age 17 when he migrated to the United States and joined his brother. To pay his way through college, he worked in restaurants and eventually took a job at U.S. Swim and Fitness (then Nautilus Fitness Center, Inc.).
It was there that he found his calling. He conceived of something more than just a gym. He envisioned a comprehensive, healthy-way-of-life company that could have a significant impact on the overall wellness of consumers.
Akradi worked his way up and eventually became part owner of the health club. By the time it was sold in 1986, it was the second-largest health club chain in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market.
After the sale, Akradi was resolute on making his own gym a reality. He liquidated all his personal assets and opened a 27,000-square foot club in a Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, location where three other clubs had already failed. Akradi set a goal to sell 2,700 memberships in a year and he made it with 2,702.
Life Time Fitness 119 locations in 36 markets, including the U.S. and Canada, plus nutritional products, a healthy lifestyle magazine called Experience Life, athletic events, full-service spas and cafes, personal training, health education, and corporate wellness programs. The company’s success attracted attention from private investors, and in 2015 private-equity firms Leonard Green & Partners, TPG and LNK Partners purchased all outstanding share of Life Time Fitness in a deal valued at more than $4 billion.
Akradi himself continues to challenge his abilities. He competes in and organizes “Leadville races” and “Leadman triathlons,” the latter comprising a 3.1-mile swim, 140-mile bike and 13.6-mile run.

NEAL ST. ANTHONY
@StAnthonyStrib


Life Time Fitness’ announcement last week that it will be acquired by private equity firms in a $4 billion deal is the biggest Minnesota transaction so far this year.
And CEO Bahram Akradi, Life Time’s founder and who will continue as the boss, has committed to a “rollover investment of $125 million in Life Time common stock,” about two-thirds of his worth in the company. Akradi is among the largest shareholders. He’s also cashing out a big stake that looks to be about $55 million.
Akradi, 53, a fitness buff who founded the company in 1992, owns 6.4 percent of the health and wellness enterprise, or about 2.5 million shares. The cash offer price for the deal was $72.10 per share. That means Akradi’s shares, including restricted stock that will vest at closing of the deal, are worth $180.25 million.


The $55.25 million is what’s left after the $125 million he’s investing in the transaction.
“Making the decision to roll in the bulk of my net worth [into] this thing was not a tough decision for me,” Akradi said in an interview on the day of the sale announcement.
Private equity ownership typically lasts several years. Akradi’s investment probably means he’s working for more than wages under the new ownership structure. He should get another return on his investment, presumably positive if everything works out, when private equity owners Leonard Green & Partners, TPG and LNK Partners exit their investment in the future through a sale to somebody else or even a public offering, as these things go.
Akradi is a hands-on CEO who enjoys finding solutions to business problems and has the entrepreneur’s bug in a big way.

“I’m more excited than ever. I don’t expect to slow down one bit,” Akradi said.
Patrick Kennedy and Neal St. Anthony
Pioneering Minnesota businesswomen honored
Dorothy Staugaard Dalquist, the woman behind the Bundt pans in countless kitchens, was also with her late husband, David, the founding force behind Nordic Ware.
The Dalquists started Nordic Ware in 1946 as a maker of ethnic kitchenware such as the Rosette Iron and Ebleskiver Pan. The St. Louis Park-based company really took off in the 1950s thanks to the Bundt pan, for which Dorothy Dalquist concocted recipes and reached a strategic partnership with Pillsbury Co. to mass-produce Bundt mixes.

One of the original Bundt molds resides in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. And 500-employee Nordic Ware, on whose board Dalquist continues to serve, sells 350 products sold around the world.
Dalquist is one of eight Minnesota businesswomen who will be inducted into the Minnesota Business Owners Hall of Fame on April 9 at ceremonies at Cargill’s Minnetonka headquarters. Other inductees include:
• Maureen Steinwall, who bought Steinwell Inc., a custom thermoplastic injection molding company from her father in 1987 and built the Coon Rapids manufacturer from a $1-million-sales enterprise into a business of 150 employees and revenue of more than $20 million.
• The late Leeann Chin, who left China in 1956 and took in sewing and cooked from her home after she arrived in Minnesota. She started Leeann Chin’s restaurants in 1980, sold to General Mills in 1985 and bought it back in 1988, reaching 33 locations at one point.
• Kathleen Zurek, who in 1981 started Diversified Adjustment Service of Coon Rapids, the first female-owned and operated collection agency in Minnesota; it employs 110 in an industry dominated by male-owned firms.

It’s executive compensation season
Based on reports filed with shareholders of Minnesota public companies, the biggest 2014 paydays so far this proxy season went to CEOs Jim Cracchiolo of Ameriprise at $97.4 million, Doug Baker of Ecolab at $47.3 million and Scott Wine of Polaris Industries at $31.4 million.
Much of the compensation for each came from long-term equity awards. It helps that Ameriprise, Ecolab and Polaris stocks have hit all-time highs.
The soaring stock market of the past six years has been more of a boon to America’s executive suite than previously reported, a Reuters study revealed last week.
CEOs at large U.S. companies collectively realized at least $6 billion more in compensation than initially estimated in annual disclosures, thanks to the increased value of their stock awards over the period. About 300 CEOs who served throughout the 2009-13 period at S&P 500 companies together realized about $22 billion in compensation in the form of pay, bonuses and share and option grants, according to executive compensation analyst Equilar.
That compares with about $16 billion initially reported in annual company summary compensation tables, which include estimates for the value of stock grants based on the price of shares at the time of awards. The comparison does not include pensions and perks such as country club memberships.
Emerge recognized by Bank of America
Emerge, the nonprofit training agency that just opened an employment center with business and education partners in the restored North Branch Library building at W. Broadway and Emerson Avenue N., has been recognized as a “Neighborhood Builder” by the Bank of America Charitable Foundation.
The award includes a $200,000 grant and leadership training.
“This investment will empower [Emerge] to continue to help adults and youth access key services, specifically at their new [North Side] Career and Technology Center, leading them down a path to brighter futures,” said Larry Kloth, Twin Cities market president of Bank of America.
Cyber security addressed at St. Mary’s
Adm. James Stavridis, retired supreme allied commander of NATO, will address the ethics of cyber security at the annual Hendrickson Forum at St. Mary’s University of Minnesota’s university center on Park Avenue on April 9. Mary Brainerd, CEO of HealthPartners, will be honored for ethical leadership. Ticket information: www.smumn.edu/Hendricksonforum or 612-238-4545.

Bahram Akradi
2011









Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Founder Life Time Fitness, Inc.

Bahram Akradi founded Life Time Fitness with the mission to provide an educational, entertaining, friendly and inviting, functional and innovative experience that meets the health and fitness needs of the entire family. With unwavering commitment to the member point of view, he and Life Time Fitness have since been credited with transforming the health and fitness industry.
Today, as the Healthy Way of Life Company, Life Time helps organizations, communities and individuals to achieve total health objectives, athletic aspirations and fitness goals by engaging in their areas of interest – or discovering new passions – both inside and outside of Life Time’s distinctive and large sports, professional fitness, family recreation and spa destinations, most of which operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Company’s Healthy Way of Life approach enables customers to achieve this by providing the best places, people and programs of uncompromising quality and value.
Additionally, through Life Time Fitness’ development of nutritional products, the award-winning healthy lifestyle magazine, Experience Life, world-class athletic events, full-service spas and cafes, personal training consultation, health and nutrition education, and corporate wellness programs, Akradi has led the creation not of a “health club” or “gym” chain, but rather, a comprehensive, Healthy Way of Life Company and brand that continues to have a significant impact on the health and wellness of consumers.
Prior to launching Life Time Fitness, Akradi led the growth of the Minnesota-based U.S. Swim and Fitness (formerly Nautilus Fitness Center, Inc.), of which he was part owner. It was the second-largest health club chain in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market when Akradi and his partners sold it to Bally Total Fitness in 1986. After continuing to operate the business as a division of Bally for more than two years, Akradi left the company to develop business plans and secure investors for his own company, which was established three years later. Life Time Fitness subsequently was introduced to consumers in 1992.
A native of Tehran, Iran, Akradi relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, at age 17. He began his health club career in sales at Nautilus Fitness Center while attending the University of Colorado and completing the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering.
Life Time Fitness (NYSE: LTM) is headquartered in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

Person of the Year: Bahram Akradi
By Peter Francesconi

 At first blush, it might seem a stretch to pick as Tennis Industry’s Person of the Year the founder, president and CEO of a chain of fitness clubs. But, Life Time Fitness is no ordinary string of clubs, and Bahram Akradi is no ordinary CEO. In fact, when it comes to tennis and, well, all things fitness related, Life Time is quite extraordinary. 
 “We want to make sure that whatever sports we offer, we do it in the absolute best fashion,” says the 53-year-old Akradi. “We spend an enormous amount of time creating a sense of place, we work hard to cast the right staff and to make sure our programs are second to none.” 
 And it’s that story that has taken the Chanhassen, Minn.-based Life Time Fitness from $1 million in revenues in 1992 to a $1.3 billion company today, and from a single club, to now having 25,000 employees at 113 facilities, with more on the way. There are more than 800,000 memberships (including family memberships), which translates into “a couple of million” men, women and children belonging to a Life Time club. 
 Tennis Investment 
 Tennis-wise, Life Time has been investing in the sport for years, and it’s hit on a formula that provides top-notch facilities, amenities and programs for its tennis players. The company now has more than 200 courts at 20 locations, including 128 indoor courts, making Life Time Fitness the largest operator of indoor courts in the U.S. 
 “We are building tennis, and continue to look for opportunities,” says Akradi, who was always into fitness but started playing tennis later in life. In fact, the newest Life Time facility, opened in November in Henderson, Nev., near Las Vegas, has 12 courts — four outdoors and eight indoors. In typical Life Time fashion, the indoor courts are cushioned Rebound Ace in a beautiful facility. 
 “I didn’t want to have tennis when I first started,” Akradi admits. “When you look at revenue per square foot for tennis versus other things, it’s a head-scratcher. But we ended up buying a club and excess land near Detroit, then bought Wellbridge clubs, and before we knew it, we were doing tennis. Now, I love the sport. And as we delivered the complete spectrum of athletics, I wanted to offer tennis along with squash and racquetball.” 
 Life Time, says Greg Lappin, the company’s national tennis director, is very committed to the sport. “The business plan for new builds is to attract the top 20 percent of the market, so wherever they purchase property, they try to have land for tennis,” he says. 
 Lappin says Akradi figured out that, while tennis may not be as lucrative per square foot, tennis players are much more committed. “With fitness people, one-third may leave every year,” Lappin says. “The tennis attrition is 10 to 12 percent at the better facilities, and that’s what we’re finding. Our member retention is excellent. And when you look at who spends the most in ancillary expenditures, in clubs that have tennis, it’s the tennis members. They stay longer, and they spend more,” and they will travel further to play. 
 The story of Life Time Fitness, though, wouldn’t be complete without touching on Akradi’s story. The son of an Iranian air force officer, Akradi was 17 years old when he left his home in Tehran in 1978, just ahead of the Iranian revolution. He moved to Colorado, where he lived with an older brother, washed dishes at a restaurant and enrolled in his senior year in high school. 
 Akradi took college courses at Pikes Peak Community College then at University of Colorado–Colorado Springs for electrical engineering. He also worked the graveyard shift at a Nautilus fitness club. From there, he started selling memberships, then in a few years co-managed a Nautilus club in Minnesota. He soon was looking for new locations to open up Nautilus clubs. 
 Along the way Akradi, who had always been into working out and keeping fit, developed his own strategy about how to run a successful, customer-centric health and fitness business. In 1992, he left behind a big salary and struck out with his first Life Time Fitness location, in Brooklyn Park, Minn. 
 Now, the massive, elegant Life Time facilities offer everything from racquet sports, to swimming, to fitness classes, to basketball, weightlifting, aerobics — the roster is nearly endless. The rows of aerobic machines are truly impressive. Many locations have a café that serves healthy food. And there are areas for entertaining, relaxing and socializing. 
 Focus on the Customer 
 “When I started Life Time, I had looked at how we were doing business in this industry as a whole, and I was disappointed in the fitness industry’s perspective on how they dealt with customers,” Akradi says. “Everything was from a business owner’s point of view, but it wasn’t the best product, service or program. 
 “We wanted to design a club that in all ways suited the members. So, we have a month-to-month membership. We give our customers a long leash for money-back guarantees. We wanted to do everything right for the customer.” 
 That thinking also is why Akradi offers the Rebound Ace surface. “When Life Time does something,” adds Lappin, “it does it top shelf. I really enjoy Rebound Ace; it’s much softer. It adds a few hundred thousand dollars to the bill, but for our customers, it’s worth it. It’s our commitment to giving a first-class product.” 
 With tennis, Akradi is hoping to work more with the USTA “to build a program where we can sponsor and pay for kids on a regular basis,” he says. “I really want Life Time to impact tennis in America in a big way.” 
 Akradi himself plays tennis once or twice a week and sees the sport as important in the overall scheme of health and fitness. In addition, he still keeps very active with other fitness activities, including biking and cycling. 
 But his passion is in giving customers what they want and need — and doing it in the best way possible. “That’s allowed us to evolve and get better all the time,” he says. 
 — Peter Francesconi 
 Tips For Success 

Create a “sense of place that appeals to all the senses,” Bahram Akradi says.
Go for the best in all things, even if it costs more to begin with. And be consistent.
It’s all about the customer. Everything Life Time Fitness does considers the customer first.
