 Educational Background



MBA 
Class of 2004 


Pepperdine University - Graziadio School of Business and Management

                  Graziadio School Mission Statement

The University's founder, George Pepperdine, was motivated by a desire to help men and women prepare themselves for a life of usefulness in a competitive world. He particularly advocated a business education, coupled with the development of Christian character. It is his outlook which serves to anchor the mission of the business school.
Mission Statement:

The mission of the George L. Graziadio School of Business and Management is to develop values-centered leaders and advance responsible business practice through education that is entrepreneurial in spirit, ethical in focus, and global in orientation. As a professional school growing out of the tradition of a Christian University, we seek to positively impact both society at large, and the organizations and communities in which our students and graduates are members. Therefore, we affirm a higher purpose for business practice than the exclusive pursuit of shareholder wealth. We believe that successful management seeks collective good along with individual profit and is anchored in core values such as integrity, stewardship, courage, and compassion.
