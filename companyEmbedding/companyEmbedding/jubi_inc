Not being able to transfer learning into application and performance.
The Learn-Do-Inspire architecture drives employee application, behavior change, and performance improvement.










Creating “sustainability” of classroom delivery.
Jubi can be used in a “blended” journey where participants complete several activities before a workshop and the complete activities for 6 – 10 weeks post workshop including content refresh, on-the-job application, social interaction, and coaching.










Not being able to measure and report the impact or return on what they are doing.
Jubi can provide data on completion of “Do Activities” which are by definition, on-the-job application actions.  In addition, Jubi can map Do Activities to Business KPIs enabling a view of impact on business drivers.  Jubi can embed industry best practice measurement schemes into a program.










Getting employee time to engage in learning and development.
Jubi’s micro-learning and mobile ready platform allow learning to be delivered on-demand and in line with employee operational realities.  Game mechanics and a notification system keeps employees coming back and engaged in the learning process any time, any where.










Integrating tools into a seamless learner experience
Jubi provides the seamless integration of micro-learning, task management, discussion forums, gamification, notifications, mobile delivery, dashboarding, content management, authoring, and administration. Trying to create the Jubi experience by integrating currently available tools would take years and be cost prohibitive.










Getting IT to help get the LMS and other tools to do what they want
Since Jubi is a cloud based system very little or no help from IT is needed to get up and running.  Integration with corporate systems can be done as customers desire using an open API.

Corporate Training Platform - Jubi, Inc Microlearning Platform








































 


 










 






 





















Corporate Training Platform – Gamification Is The Future
Corporate training platform tools and software have become increasingly important in generating engagement amongst employee bases. With a shift in how employee learning should be carried out, it’s never been more important to have the right software for the job.
And the right employee engagement software should involve elements of micro-learning and ‘gamification’. You may have heard of micro-learning – the method that utilizes bite-sized chunks of knowledge and passes them onto your employee base for immediate use in their everyday role – but what about gamification? What is it? Well, it’s a system of employee learning that is becoming more and more adopted by the corporate world. With mobile learning and mLearning becoming more relevant due to the widespread availability of smartphones and mobile internet, there’s a need to build an experience suited to these platforms and suited to employee engagement. Just taking the ‘e’ out of eLearning and replacing it with an ‘m’ isn’t going to cut it. Your employee base engages with their smartphones everyday – they have become used to the way content is packaged and presented to them. Instead of presenting them with an outdated experience when it comes to employee learning, why not have corporate training software that emulates these apps and social games? Gamification does just that. Taking game mechanics such as points, badges, leaderboards and levels, gamification creates a sense of achievement when an employee completes their bite-sized training modules. They can earn points, badges or move up the leaderboard. This can create some healthy competition between your staff, foster a constant loop of achievement and recognition, and – most importantly – makes the employee learning process fun.
At Jubi, Inc., our white-label corporate training platform has been developed with all of this in mind. We’ve made the user learning experience fun and easy-to-use across all devices; not just for employees, but also for managers too with analytics and easy-to-read data. For more information, please go to http://www.getjubi.com/ or call 678-427-1107.

Features – Jubi, Inc.








































 


 










 






 





















  



















				Learn, Do, and Inspire Performance.

Programs & Levels
Challenges, Scoring, Badges
To Do’s & Discussions

and more






  






























Quests & Challenges 




The core-learning vehicle in Jubi is the QUEST, which is composed of CHALLENGES. The concept behind the quest is to drive an inquiry based process to explore content in order to answer a question or solve a puzzle. This method has been proven to stimulate our brain’s natural desire to engage and solve problems.
For most typical challenges, the user will see a question or puzzle on the left side of their screen. The right side of their screen will feature media based content. Media based content can be uploaded or embedded in a challenge through the Jubi Authoring Suite. Most standard versions of video, image, and audio files can be uploaded into Jubi.





  






























Inspiration Station 




The Inspire Section of Jubi allows users to shape the social environment of their learning community without the need for exhaustive and expensive community management.
The Inspire Section enables users to:

Encourage others
Appreciate others
Capture and share stories






  






























Discussions 




The discussion Section enables social interaction, coaching, and collective problem solving among users.
The discussion section enables users to:

Search for discussions by person, topic, or category
Create new discussions including a topic and comments
Save and name personal discussion groups
 Participate in existing discussions through comments
Add media to any discussion posting
Categorize discussions
Receive points for creating new discussions and participating in existing discussions.






  






























To Do’s 




Jubi drives validated on-the-job behavior change and performance improvement through the To-Do’s section.  After users complete a quest, they are directed to a set of pre-defined application activities, or “To-Do’s”.
A To-Do is an activity that users perform in the work place to practice or apply a lesson learned in a quest.  Users can be assigned either “Honor System” or Verification Required” To-Do’s.





  






























				Leaderboards			




Research on the psychology of motivation shows that healthy competition results in higher levels of collective achievement.  Leaderboards are a central element of gamification and Jubi provides this functionality.  The leaderboard is a channel dedicated to showing relative progress and performance between users and displays a stacked ranking of users based on point totals.





  






























				Dashboards			




The dashboard serves as the home for data and analytics.  The dashboard can display data for an individual and a group of individuals in both tabular and graphical formats.  Data can be filtered over any period of time.  Data available includes.





  






























				Network			




The Network Section allows users to view and access everyone in their program group or community.  Users are presented with summary information on other network members and have one-click access to each other’s profile.  Users can search for members of their learning community using search criteria.  A special component in the Network Section is the ability to select or be assigned a “Buddy”.  Buddies act as accountability partners and coaches, and have access to each other’s To-Do Task items.  Buddies get notifications on the status of To-Do’s.

Social Learning Tools - Jubi, Inc Microlearning Platform










































 


 










 






 





















 
Social Learning Tools – What Are They?
Social learning tools have become an important part of modern employee training. Despite that, many organizations still don’t really know what social learning is and what these tools can provide. In this article, we’re going to explain the basic principles of social learning and why you should consider switching to this method of employee training.
Social learning software and tools make use of social learning platform software and even the likes of social media to create an engaging learning environment between systems and people. This, in turn, allows for education to be far-reaching and more suited to today’s way of consuming media and information. Even social media websites like Facebook and Twitter can be considered social learning platforms due to the sharing of information between individuals across the world. So social learning isn’t just a formalized method of corporate training; it happens all around us. And given that so many people have become used to these tools and apps that push forward social learning, it makes sense that organizations should incorporate elements of these tools and platforms into their training programs. These social learning environments are created across an organization’s departments via tools specifically created to foster such a collaborative learning environment. For an organization, this form of training can also save money over traditional forms of training if you use the right employee engagement software. This software removes the need for costly training exercises and learning can, instead, take place wherever your employees are located.
So what social learning tools do you need for your organization? Well, we think we’ve got the tool for you. At Jubi, Inc., we have developed our product with social learning in mind. Combining collaboration, micro-learning with a fun gaming experience, your employees will love learning with Jubi. For more information, go to http://www.getjubi.com/.
