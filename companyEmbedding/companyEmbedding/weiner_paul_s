Description

                    Written by a Czech Jewish boy, "A Boy in Terezin" covers a year of Pavel Weiner's life in the Theresienstadt transit camp in the Czech town of Terezin from April 1944 until liberation in April 1945. The Germans claimed that Theresienstadt was "the town the Fuhrer gave the Jews," and they temporarily transformed it into a Potemkin village for an International Red Cross visit in June 1944, the only Nazi camp opened to outsiders. But the Germans lied. Theresienstadt was a holding pen for Jews to be shipped east to annihilation camps. While famous and infamous figures and historical events flit across the pages, they form the background for Pavel's life. Assigned to the now-famous Czech boys' home, L417, Pavel served as editor of the magazine Ne?ar. Relationships, sports, the quest for food, and a determination to continue their education dominate the boys' lives. Pavel's father and brother were deported in September 1944; he turned thirteen (the age for his bar mitzvah) in November of that year, and he grew in his ability to express his observations and reflect on them. "A Boy in Terezin" registers the young boy's insights, hopes, and fears and recounts a passage into maturity during the most horrifying of times."show more

How your neighborhood coffee shop is brewing geniuses

Editor’s Note: For this week’s Making Sen$e segment, economics correspondent Paul Solman sat down with Eric Weiner to discuss his new book “The Geography of Genius” over coffee. Genius, says Weiner, is not just born, it’s created and cultivated, often in cities. And in 1900 Vienna, the coffee shop was imperative to cultivating the creativity necessary for genius.
So what geniuses came out of these Viennese coffee shops? Sigmund Freud, Gustav Klimt and Leon Trotsky. But before that, Vienna produced Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn. So what was it about Vienna? Weiner explains below. For more on the topic, watch this week’s Making Sen$e segment, which airs every Thursday on the PBS NewsHour. The following text has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.
— Kristen Doerer, Making Sen$e Editor

Paul Solman: So what got you interested in genius — are you a particularly smart guy?
Eric Weiner: No, I’m not. Ask my wife. I’m interested in genius the way a hungry man is interested in Philadelphia cheesesteaks. I want something. I want a piece of it. And I’ve always been a big believer in the power of place. I believe that where we are affects who we are when it comes to happiness, spirituality, economics and creative genius. We often ask, “What is genius? Who is a genius?” We don’t often ask, “Where is genius?”
Paul Solman: And therefore, “The Geography of Genius.”
Eric Weiner: Exactly. Genius is not only a what or a who, it is a where. It is grounded in a place every single time. You look around the world at geniuses, and they don’t appear randomly, they appear in genius clusters. Athens in 50 BC, Florence 1500, Silicon Valley today. This is not a coincidence. Something was in the water back then, and what I want to know is: Can we bottle it?
Paul Solman: So what was it about Vienna?
Eric Weiner: The coffee shop played a big role in Vienna of 1900. Rents were sky high, housing was difficult to come by, your apartment probably wasn’t heated, and so you went to the coffee shop. You went to the coffee shop because it was warm, because it was great Viennese coffee, and you went for the conversation and the company. You also went for the news of the day. They had, and they still do, newspapers on display, for you to read. That’s where people found out what was going on around the world, and it’s where they exchanged ideas. They had conversations, and every topic was fair game in a Viennese coffeehouse.

Paul Solman: Does coffee play a part?
Eric Weiner:  No. I would love to think there is a direct relationship between coffee and genius, but they’ve done studies, and if anything, caffeine probably makes you a little less creative. When you drink coffee, you become very focused, and in fact, the key to creative genius is to be defocused. Psychologists call it “defocused attention,” where you broaden your horizons, let your mind float and drift a bit. Coffee keeps us sharp and alert. It’s great if you’re driving at 3 o’clock in the morning. It’s not so great if you’re trying to come up with the next violin concerto.
Paul Solman: So coffee isn’t good for the day dreaming of genius, but it’s good for focusing on interaction.
Eric Weiner: The coffeehouse is good for genius, and the Viennese coffeehouse is a classic case. Freud had his favorite coffee shop, and so did Gustav Klimt. If you walk into a coffee shop in 1903 Vienna, you might find at the same table the artist Gustav Klimt, Sigmund Freud, Leon Trotsky and possibly Adolf Hitler, who lived in Vienna at the same time.
Paul Solman: I don’t think they were going to invite Hitler over to their table, really.
Eric Weiner: Probably not, but they were all in Vienna at the same time. You had world’s colliding and it’s colliding in the coffeehouse.
It was really the Internet of its day. It’s where people went to get the news, it’s where they went to share ideas. And it’s where they went to say the sort of things they couldn’t say in the office or even at home.
Paul Solman: So we should have more coffeehouses?
Here’s a product of some of that genius. Museum visitors study Gustav Klimt’s 1907 painting “Adele Bloch-Bauer I.” Eric Weiner explains that Klimt, like his fellow geniuses of the day, found creativity in coffee shops across Vienna. Photo by Chris Pizzello/Reuters
Eric Weiner: Yes! I think we should have more coffeehouses, more cafes, more “third places.” More places where people can get together that’s not work, not home, and where they can interact with people who are different from them.
Paul Solman: But we have a Starbucks on every corner, and on some street corners, we have two of them.
Eric Weiner: Well, have you heard of the Starbucks effect? So right now what do you hear?
Paul Solman: I hear a buzz, I hear clinking.
Eric Weiner: You hear a buzz, a background noise which I’m willing to bet is near 70 decibels. They’ve done studies. What is the ideal audio atmosphere for creativity and it turns out it is not complete silence, and it is not a very loud atmosphere, it’s something just like this — about 70 decibels. The sort of sound level that you would find in a Starbucks or another coffee shop because it defocuses your attention. Have you ever found that when you’re stuck on something creatively, you can’t solve a problem, you go to a coffee shop? People don’t go to Starbucks for the coffee — of that I’m pretty sure — they go for the atmosphere, they go for the 70 decibels, they go for the Starbucks effect.
Paul Solman: They go for the Wi-Fi.
Eric Weiner: They go for the Wi-Fi. Again, that’s like the coffeehouses of 1900 Vienna. People went for the newspapers that they could read when they got coffee, they went to interact and they went to get out of their own heads. The creative act always requires a stepping back. It’s called the incubation period. The incubation period — one of the four phases of creativity — is when you’re not consciously thinking of a problem, and you’re letting it marinate. So this is why you hear time and again, people saying they had that “Eureka” moment in the bath, like Archimedes, or in the shower, or while going for a walk or in a coffeehouse.
Paul Solman:  But in your book you’ve got an earlier Vienna — the Vienna of Mozart and Beethoven — so what explains that period?
Eric Weiner: Music was literally in the air at the time, the Vienna of 1780. Everybody played music, classical music. There were in fact so many musicians that in apartment buildings people had to come up with a schedule — you practice at 5 p.m., I’ll practice at 6 p.m. That way the music didn’t collide with one another. Someone like Mozart moves from Salzburg to Vienna, where all of the sudden he finds this musical city that is not only asking for music, it’s demanding music of him. And my theory is that a Mozart symphony is very much like a Pixar movie — in the sense that Pixar movies are hugely successful because they operate on several levels at the same time. They appeal to the kids and they appeal to their parents. Likewise, and Mozart says this in one of his letters, I’m writing for two audiences. I’m writing for the connoisseurs who will get it, and I’m writing for the “average man” who will still appreciate it. So you had all these levels of audience going on in Vienna, and you have people like Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn fulfilling a demand in a way. Genius is part of this ecology of creativity, and the audience was a big component of that.
169140169132169132What are the ingredients for genius?What kind of environment spawns genius? That’s the question Eric Weiner tackles in his latest book, “The Geography of Genius,” in which Weiner journeys around the world and through time, from Plato’s Athens to Leonardo da Vinci’s Florence, to find the secret ingredients behind some of the greatest minds in history, and what it means for America today. Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports.2016-01-21 18:00:00disabled2365649090D8f07uXRaws
Paul Solman:  So you mean that the community is a virtuous circle that then breeds geniuses?
Eric Weiner: It’s a magnet. These places are like magnets; they attract people from far and wide. Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, none of them were born in Vienna. They all moved there. It became a magnet, but what made it magnetized in the first place? There has to be a seed there. In the case of Vienna of about 1780, it was this deep-seated love of music.
But you need a seed. You need some reason why Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn in the 18th century all flocked to Vienna. What was it about Vienna? They must have known on some level that that is where they would flourish. It’s what biologists call “selective migration.” When a species migrates somewhere, because it senses that it will thrive there. And these geniuses sensed that Vienna was the place to be, because the music was literally in the air. Everybody was a musician, the emperor was a musician, and the average street sweeper was a musician who played the violin or the piano and who went to concerts — some of whom were free in the park — and who were very demanding of their composers. Don’t forget that Mozart worked on commission. He almost always would write something if he knew exactly who was paying for it and where it would be performed. So you can’t really separate the creation of genius from the appreciation of it. It’s almost like the city of Vienna was a co-genius that worked alongside Mozart and Beethoven and the rest.

It was supposed to be a quiet, late-summer weekend on the exclusive shores of the Hamptons. But on Sunday, Huma Abedin, the closest aide to Hillary Clinton, received devastating news.After accompanying Mrs. Clinton to fund-raisers, Ms. Abedin learned from her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, that The New York Post was about to report that he had again exchanged lewd messages with a woman on social media: the sort of behavior that destroyed his congressional career and 2013 mayoral campaign.Only this time, the online indiscretions included an image of Mr. Weiner’s crotch as he lay next to the couple’s 4-year-old son.Now, Mr. Weiner’s tawdry activities may have claimed his marriage — Ms. Abedin told him that she wanted to separate — and have cast another shadow on the adviser and confidante who has been by Mrs. Clinton’s side for the past two decades. Ms. Abedin was already a major figure this summer in controversies over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information as secretary of state and over ties between the Clinton family foundation and Mrs. Clinton’s State Department.

Mr. Weiner’s extramarital behavior also threatens to remind voters about the troubles in the Clintons’ own marriage over the decades, including Mrs. Clinton’s much-debated decision to remain with then-President Bill Clinton after revelations of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Abedin’s choice to separate from her husband evokes the debates that erupted over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the Lewinsky affair, a scandal her campaign wants left in the past.

Clinton advisers expressed only sympathy for Ms. Abedin on Monday and said they were confident Mr. Weiner’s actions would not hurt Mrs. Clinton, who learned about them from Ms. Abedin and offered support. But Mr. Weiner’s behavior quickly became fodder for Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton’s Republican opponent in the presidential race.“Huma is making a very wise decision,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him.”

He then went further, claiming that the marriage’s breakdown was a matter of national security. Mrs. Clinton received her first intelligence briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee on Saturday at the F.B.I. field office in White Plains. No aides accompanied her to the briefing, according to a campaign official.“I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” Mr. Trump said, using language that echoed criticism of Mrs. Clinton this summer by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.”A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks.The spotlight on Ms. Abedin and her proximity to Mrs. Clinton has been an increasing distraction for the campaign.Several of Ms. Abedin’s emails on Mrs. Clinton’s private server have drawn scrutiny amid accusations that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access to the State Department.And political opponents, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have questioned Ms. Abedin’s arrangement to earn income privately while she worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. In addition to being on Mrs. Clinton’s personal payroll, Ms. Abedin received money from the Clinton Foundation and Teneo, a consulting firm founded in part by Douglas J. Band, previously a senior aide to Mr. Clinton.

Ms. Abedin, 40, has been at Mrs. Clinton’s side since she was an intern to the first lady in the 1990s. Now vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, Ms. Abedin, often described as a surrogate daughter, occupies an almost singular role as a trusted, and visible, confidante to Mrs. Clinton.Their lives took similar tracks, as both women, citing their religious beliefs, seemed determined to remain married despite their husbands’ sexual proclivities.

Mrs. Clinton strongly supported Ms. Abedin when Mr. Weiner’s sexually charged text messages came to light in 2011, a year into their marriage, and again in 2013, when Mr. Weiner was running for mayor of New York. Friends of Mrs. Clinton said that she had spoken to Ms. Abedin at length about the marriage and that she supported Ms. Abedin’s decision to remain with Mr. Weiner and work on their relationship.The couple’s marital problems have been a subject of years of tabloid mockery and humiliation since Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 amid revelations that he had sent sexual images of himself to women on social media. His 2013 campaign for mayor was damaged, too, when Mr. Weiner admitted that he had continued flirting with women online.By Monday morning, when the Post cover showing Mr. Weiner and his son, Jordan, hit newsstands, Mr. Weiner had left the Hamptons for New York City aware that Ms. Abedin planned to announce their separation, said two people close to the couple who discussed private conversations on the condition of anonymity.“After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Ms. Abedin said in a statement. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.”In the latest issue of Vogue, Ms. Abedin portrayed Mr. Weiner as a devoted father and their marriage as a true partnership. “Many working moms feel this way — there is a lot of guilt,” she said. “I don’t think I could do it if I didn’t have the full support system I have, if Anthony wasn’t willing to be, essentially, a full-time dad.”But the two people close to the couple said Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner had been growing apart for some time, with Ms. Abedin often on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weiner at home with Jordan. They said the Post article had not caused a sudden and unexpected rupture to a happy marriage, but rather was the final catalyst for Ms. Abedin to move for a separation.

Campaign officials had braced for new revelations about Mr. Weiner after The Post reported this month that a Republican had baited Mr. Weiner into a flirtatious online chat. Asked by The New York Times this month whether he was still engaging in the behavior that had foiled his political career, Mr. Weiner said, “I’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that.”

Mrs. Clinton had hoped to ride out the final week of August with limited distractions as she seeks to maintain her solid lead in national polls. On Monday, she attended three fund-raisers in the Hamptons, without Ms. Abedin, and spoke briefly on a conference call with policy experts and medical providers to unveil her proposals on mental health.“We’ve got to make clear mental health is not a personal failing,” Mrs. Clinton said.Aides said that Ms. Abedin’s marriage was a private matter and that her decision to announce the separation meant the frenetic news cycle would soon move on.“The best way to get rid of a problem is to get rid of a problem,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. “The end of that marriage publicly announced makes it impossible for Anthony Weiner to have anything to do with the campaign.”But unlike many political aides, Ms. Abedin has become a public figure in her own right, posing for Vogue, snapping selfies with voters on the rope line at Mrs. Clinton’s campaign events and hosting her own fund-raisers on her boss’s behalf.Hours after Ms. Abedin released her statement, Showtime blasted out a news release announcing the October television debut of “Weiner,” an unfettered documentary about the implosion of Mr. Weiner’s mayoral campaign and the couple’s interactions after his second scandal.In the messages reported by The Post, Mr. Weiner exchanged photos with a woman. She appeared in various bikinis, and Mr. Weiner was half-dressed, showing off his stomach or his groin — and they talked about sex.

In one message, Mr. Weiner abruptly changed the discussion from massage parlors and reportedly wrote, “Someone just climbed into my bed.”“Really?” the woman replied.His response, in a screen shot dated July 31, 2015, showed a child curled up next to Mr. Weiner, who was wearing only white briefs.
