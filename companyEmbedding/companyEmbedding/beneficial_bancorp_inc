Short Interest Decreases By 16.2% For BNCL
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 10/30/2015 settlement date, which shows a 406,336 share decrease in total short interest for Beneficial Bancorp Inc , to 2,104,678, a decrease of 16.18% since 10/15/2015. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. to acquire Conestoga Bank
PHILADELPHIA, PA (October 22, 2015) — Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. (“Beneficial”) (NASDAQ:BNCL), the holding company for Beneficial Bank (“Beneficial Bank”), and Conestoga Bancorp, Inc. (“Conestoga Bancorp”), the holding company for Conestoga Bank, announced today the signing of a definitive stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Beneficial will acquire Conestoga Bancorp’s ownership interest in Conestoga Bank, and Conestoga Bank will subsequently be merged into Beneficial Bank.
Conestoga Bank is a locally-managed institution dedicated to providing high quality community banking and commercial lending services with locations in Philadelphia, Delaware, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Lehigh Counties. Conestoga Bank has approximately $712 million in assets, $506 million in loans and $530 million in deposits as of June 30, 2015 and serves its customers from fourteen locations.  Conestoga Bank also provides equipment financing through its wholly owned subsidiary, Conestoga Equipment Finance Corp. and offers Small Business Administration loans to commercial customers.
Gerard P. Cuddy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Beneficial, said, “We are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire Conestoga Bank which strengthens our position in the Philadelphia marketplace and provides an opportunity to meaningfully improve our earnings profile as we begin to deploy our capital from the second step conversion. Conestoga Bank’s fourteen locations are a great complement to our branch network and add important commercial and consumer relationships to our banking franchise. Combining our two well-established and well-respected companies will create an enhanced community banking franchise that is better positioned to serve our customers, our employees and our communities.”
Mr. Cuddy added, “We look forward to working with Conestoga Bank’s talented management team and employees to fulfill our mission of helping our customers do the right thing financially.”
The transaction is valued at 160% of Conestoga Bank’s tangible book value at closing but will not be greater than $105 million. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Conestoga, as the sole shareholder of Conestoga Bank, will receive cash for all of the outstanding shares of Conestoga Bank.  Any tangible book value in excess of $65.6 million will be distributed to Conestoga Bank’s holding company at the closing of the transaction. The closing is anticipated to occur during the first or second quarter of 2016, subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
Beneficial expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $10.1 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 45% of Conestoga Bank’s non-interest expenses. The acquisition is expected to be 45% accretive to Beneficial’s earnings per share in the first year of combined operations, excluding one-time costs. The transaction has an anticipated IRR of 15%. Beneficial expects initial tangible book value dilution of 5% from the transaction which is estimated to be earned back in 4.5 years.
Richard. A. Elko, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Conestoga Bank, said, “Conestoga is excited to be joining Beneficial, the oldest and largest Philadelphia-based bank.  Both Beneficial and Conestoga Bank share similar values and a common commitment to local decision making, exceptional personal service and community support. Our merger with Beneficial Bank will allow us to deepen our customer relationships and provide access to a wide array of products, services, and locations. We look forward to working together and building additional value for Beneficial’s shareholders.”
Beneficial was advised in this transaction by the investment banking firm of Griffin Financial Group LLC., as well as the law firm of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.  Conestoga was advised by the investment banking firm of Sandler O’Neill + Partners and the law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP.

Beneficiary Cash Advances
Are You A Beneficiary To An Inheritance And Tired Of Waiting For A Payout?
Would you like a beneficiary loan to hold you over until your inheritance is released from Probate? 
With a beneficiary cash advance from IFC, you can access your money in as little as 3 days.
Most beneficiaries waiting for an inheritance payout believe that the distribution of funds is fast and simple. Unfortunately, beneficiaries severely underestimate the time it takes to distribute an inheritance. In fact, distribution of beneficiary funds can take many months and often years to complete. Because beneficiaries often need the funds earlier than this, we provide fast cash to heirs looking for beneficiary loans – regardless of their credit status, employment or income history.
Beneficiary Loans And Advances
As America’s foremost provider of beneficiary cash advances, Inheritance Funding Company guarantees the lowest price and extremely fast and courteous service. In fact, beneficiaries often receive their cash in as little as 3 to 5 days. If you are a beneficiary to a current estate or trust and you are looking for a loan or cash advance, IFC can get you your money fast. We provide cash advances from $5,000 to $250,000, usually within just a few days of receiving your completed application.

Probate Advance Costs & Facts
IFC offers inheritance cash advances to heirs of probate estates. Our cash advance on inheritance funds are not loans. We will never charge an interest rate or require a payment schedule of any kind. This means credit history and income are truly not a problem!
When you receive a probate advance, you simply assign a portion of your future inheritance to IFC when it’s finally ready to distribute. Once you apply and receive your money from us, your work is essentially done! We then work directly with the court, probate attorney and Personal Representatives of the estate to collect our funds directly. The fact is, with a probate advance, you can receive inheritance cash in less than a week instead of months or even years.
The dollar figure for the cost of a probate advance depends on a number of factors with the particular estate. The complexity of your inheritance, whether or not real estate is involved, and how long we think it will take for the court to distribute your inheritance and pay us back all play important roles in reaching our lowest available fee.
In most cases, IFC assumes that in a worst case scenario, it will take about a year for the probate court to pay us back. If your inheritance takes longer than we estimate to distribute, the cost will NEVER go up. Unlike other loans out there, our advance cost of probate is set in stone. Even better, if probate is completed and we are paid back faster than we assumed, you will likely qualify for a substantial early pay-off rebate! Your dedicated Funding Officer will explain all possible rebates in detail before you agree to anything.
Call us directly or fill out the simple form on this page to receive your free consultation. One of our friendly Funding Officers will contact you with all of the probate advance costs and facts. If you’re an heir stuck waiting for your inheritance, there’s no reason to wait! Access your money right away with the lowest possible probate advance costs.
