EPS represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Net income (reported or estimated) for a period of time is divided by the total number of shares outstanding (TSO) during that period; See growth rate measures for EPS. Our vendor's methodology for the EPS on the infoquote and Summary Quote pages follows the EPS used by the majority of the analysts following the stock, in many cases this is EBITDA EPS.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are the second largest new residential insulation installer in the United
States based on our internal estimates, with a national platform consisting of
over 100 locations accessing customers in all 48 continental states and the
District of Columbia. We believe we have the number one or two market position
for new single-family insulation installation in more than half of the markets
in which we operate based on permits issued in those markets. We also install

Insulation


Insulation
The Premier Insulation
Installer in the U.S.







Insulation is a critical piece of the home building process. As the country’s second largest insulation installer, IBP manages all aspects of the installation process for our customers including direct purchase of material from the manufacturers, supply of material to jobsites to ensure quality service, and timely installation. We specialize in installing all types of insulation including fiberglass, spray foam, cellulose, and radiant barrier from industry leading manufacturers.
We know that insulation is a service business. While we service customers nationally, it’s the one-to-one relationships that our branch staff develop at the local level that bring the greatest value to our customers and our company. Many of our branch employees have been in our industry for decades and have a depth of knowledge of their local markets that can’t be matched. Builders, contractors and homeowners know that they can count on the quality of our work and our customer service time and time again.

About Us


About Us
ABOUT
INSTALLED BUILDING PRODUCTS








Our business began in 1977 with one location, Edwards Insulation in Columbus, Ohio. In the late 1990’s we embarked on an acquisition strategy with the goal of growing a national platform. To date, we have successfully acquired and integrated over 100 companies.
The success of IBP is directly tied to the people at the local branches. Each acquisition brings a strong customer base and talented local management, sales and installation teams. Their relationships, knowledge of the market and customer-focus are key to our successful strategy.
