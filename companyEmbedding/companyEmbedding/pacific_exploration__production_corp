Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Investor Update: Those Who Lost Money in ForceField Energy

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Update For Investors Who Lost Oil and Gas-Related Investments With Red River Securities

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.

Pacific Exploration and Production is a Canadian petroleum exploration and production company in the business of heavy crude oil and natural gas. Its focus is on Colombia and Peru where it holds numerous properties including 38 blocks in the Llanos, Sucre-Co Lower Magdalena and Cesar Valley, Rancheria, Upper and Middle Magdalena Valley, Putumayo Valley, Ucayali and Maranon basins.
In early 2010 it was the largest independent oil company operating in South America and in terms of private companies the fastest growing one in Colombia.[1] In 2011 it was responsible for 41% of the growth in oil production in Colombia. In mid-2015 it changed its name from Pacific Rubiales to Pacific Exploration and Production, signalling the diminished importance of the Rubiales field in the company's total assets and a broader focus in Latin America.[2][3]

History[edit]
The parent company's origins go back to 1985 to a TSX Venture Exchange listed company called Agincourt Explorations, however the oldest part of the current company with operations in Colombia is Petro Rubiales which began its business in 1982. In 1995 Agincourt Explorations became AGX Resources Corp.; a mineral exploration company focused on Brazil and Canada. After AGX acquired Rubiales Holdings in 2007 from Petro Rubiales it became known as Petro Rubiales Energy Corp. up until 2008 when it merged with Vancouver-based Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd. in a $2.5 billion causing a name change to Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. Less than two weeks after the merger the company delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange.[4] [5] Later in 2008 it acquired Kappa Energy, a Colombian exploration company with licenses to 747,000 acres (3,020 km2) of land which included parts of the lower, middle, and upper Magdalena, Catatumbo, and Llanos basins. The transaction was valued at $168 million and increased Pacific Rubiales' possible reserves by 24.2 million boe. Kappa is now part of division Kappa Energy Holdings.[6] On October 19, 2011 it became engaged in oil drilling activity in northern Guatemala.
In January 2010 the company signed a $190 million deal with Ocensa pipeline to use their pipeline and oil transport infrastructure to transport up to 160 million barrels of oil for a period of ten years.[7]
In September 2010 the company followed through with its promise to focus more on developing assets already mature or low risk and less on exploration in high risk areas by divesting itself of fields within the Buganviles oil and gas block of Colombia. It sold a 29.5% interest in Visure and 25% in Tuqueque to a subsidiary of Peruvian company Petrodorado. Though the deal gives Petrodorado a near joint interest in the Buganviles block (45-49.5%) Pacific Rubiales remains the controlling operator.[8]
On February 1, 2012 Pacific Rubiales Energy became the first Canadian company to receive approval from BM&F Bovespa to issue Brazilian Depository Receipts for trading on the Brazilian stock exchange.
In early 2015 as oil prices were declining, Alejandro Betancourt López of Derwick Associates led an investment group to purchase a 20% share of the company for $290 million. In April 2016, the company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy protection and would begin restructuring.[9]
Properties/Production[edit]
As of December 2011 80% of the company's 407 mboe 2P reserves are in oil with most of the other 20% in natural gas, 317 mboe are proved reserves.[2] On March 28, 2011 gross reserves were at 357.39 million boe 87% of which is net reserves.[10] By June 2011 net proved reserves were 350 million boe up 15% or 40 million barrels in six months.[11] In September 2011 net reserves stood at 341.73 million boe, slightly lower than the previous quarter due to a decline in heavy oil reserves. For the 2011 fiscal year, 75.7% of total field production of 165,446 bbls/d came from the Rubiales/Piriri field (up 34% on the year). Quifa was second at 36,496 bbls/d (up 657%). Share after royalties averaged over 2011; 63% came from Rubiales/Piriri (54,802 bbls/d up 29%), 22% from Quifa (19,181 b/d up 629%), 12% from La Creciente (10,584 b/d up 7% after being up 34% in 2010).[12][13] As of September 30, 2011 net reserves are 341.73 mboe, up from 269 mboe in December 2010.[14]
In 2011 fields that Pacific Rubiales has a joint or majority interest in accounted for just under 20% of Colombia's oil output.[15]
Since October 2010 it also has a working interest in 2 other blocks in the Petén Basin of Guatemala (shared with lamingo Energy Investment (BVI) Ltd., Chx Guatemala Limitada, and Compañía Petrolera del Atlántico).[16]
It shares joint ownership in many oil fields and exploration projects in Colombia with Ecopetrol and in Peru with Petrodorado.[17]
Its most valuable assets are the Rubiales (largest in Colombia) and Piriri oil fields in central Colombia which it operates through Meta Petroleum, a division of subsidiary Rubiales Holdings Limited (RHL). RHL has been 100% owned by pacific Rubiales since 2007 when it purchased the remaining 25% of outstanding shares.[18] Through acquisitions (Pacific Coal S.A.) it plans to enter the coal and asphalite production market.[19]
Colombia - properties jointly owned with Ecopetrol

Rubiales, Piriri fields - covers 72,839 acres (294.77 km2) of land 148 km from Puerto Gaitan. Oil was first discovered there in 1982 but production didn't begin until 1988 when the Rubiales risk participation contract was signed. Operations are conducted through subsidiary Meta Petroleum. The Rubiales oil field which has become the largest in Colombia was neglected before being acquired by Pacific Rubiales.[19]

- total field production as of September 2012 is 240,975 b/d, 116,285 b/d of which is its share before royalties. At the end of 2011 reserves stood at 407 million barrels that includes those considered proven-possible.[2] The data is independently verified.[20][21]

First production from Quifa North and Sabanero happened in the last quarter of 2011.
Rubiales had represented as much as 88% of the company's 2P reserves in terms of net working interest but due to a tripling in reserves at Quifa and the upgrading of resources at field CPE-6, by December 2011 Rubiales only accounted for 29% of reserves.[22]
Llanos basin (reserves estimated to be over 4.5 billion barrels for the whole basin)[23] - quifa field (ownership at 60%)
The intangible assets held by the company are Colombian pipeline system usage rights.[24]

Peru - Exploration and development projects are jointly owned with Petrodorado

Ucayali Basin, Maranon Basin[25]

- Production in Peru began in 2012, average production during the September 2012 quarter was 2,845 bbl/d (1,394 net). The output is attributable to a 49% interest in Block-Z1.[26]
Guatemala -In the Petén Basin, southeast of major oil fields in southern Mexico. Has the option to raise its share to 55% by investing as much as US $25.875 million in exploration and drilling.[16]
The company has experienced a steady rise in production over the last few years. Average total field production in the third quarter of 2012 was 243,820 b/d which is 24,684 b/d higher than the previous period. Ecopetrol's 50% interest in the largest field and internal consumption cost the company roughly half that, bringing its share down to 117,679 b/d (up 14,722 b/d) and 97,142 b/d after royalties (up 9,983 b/d). For the first quarter of 2011 output was 196,272 boe/d 34% more than the year before; after royalties production was up 51% to about 80,000 boe/d, production increases came from the same sources as in 2010 (Rubiales, Quifa) in addition to new production from La Creciente (to 9,700 boe/d).[10] In early 2010 total gross daily production (not including royalties based on output levels and crude oil prices) was around 130,000 boe/d compared to about 83,000 boe/d in 2009. In 2009 about 8.6 million barrels of oil it produced was exported while 1.6 million barrels of oil was used domestically in Colombia.[27] In the first three months of 2011 the company sold 26% more oil than in the corresponding period in 2010 (7.447 million boe or about 83,000 boe/d). Because it is producing below a certain royalties threshold, nearly all gross production before royalties coming from La Creciente is kept after royalties.
Criticism[edit]
Pacific Rubiales has been the focus of various controversies over the years, ranging from allegations of collusion with paramilitary death-squads, suppression of labor rights, manipulation of stock prices, and production figures, besides harassment of journalists through ad revenue pressure upon media companies to drop negative coverage.[28][29][30]
Regarding the first, it has been alleged that paramilitary forces took some of that land by illegal means before transferring ownership over to Kappa Energy, a company Pacific Rubiales acquired in 2008 (total reserves associated with Kappa Energy represent only a fraction of Pacific Rubiales total).[31] The complaints go back to 2001, prosecution claims that the real owners of the land were forcefully displaced, in response the defence is calling the land transfer agreements valid, that the family's demands are always changing, and is disputing the validity of their claims (only one of them actually lived on the land). Working conditions have also been criticised; according to journalist Alfred Molano some workers live in tents of as many as twenty people. [1] [2].
In 2012 the company came under criticism for beginning oil exploration activities on land inhabited by the Matsés indigenous people of Peru.[32] It was argued that the deforestation of hundreds of seismic testing lines and the drilling of test wells would threaten water sources depended upon by the tribe, and that the activity would also risk exposing uncontacted tribes in the surrounding areas to disease.[33] Later that year, a Colombian journalist covering protests against the company's operations died following police mistreatment.[34][35][36]
Sales[edit]
2012 - During the third quarter of the year the company sold 89,045 b/d of oil and 10,775 b/d of natural gas for a total of 99,820 b/d (down from 101,533) at an average sales price of $95.13 (up from $88.66). The company purchases some of the oil that it sells.[37]
2011 - Over the first nine months of the year, the company transported 120,172 bpd of oil through various pipeline systems, two thirds of which went through the ocensa pipeline and another 14,204 bpd via trucks. For the third quarter total field production was 219,136 bpd up 52%. Its share net of internal consumption after royalties was 87,159 bpd up 54.5%, 30,577 bpd of which came from new production Rubiales and Quifa (up from 19,241 bpd from 1,754 bpd). At an average sales price of $94.67/bbl (up 39%) that gave it revenue of $2.369 billion (up 107%).[14]
2010 - For the 2010 year total net production was 56,974 boe/d, 67% higher than in 2009; Most of the increase came from growth at the Rubiales heavy oil field.[23][38][39] Although revenue was 173% higher in the first half of 2010 than in the first half of 2009 net income continued to be weighed down by depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange losses (though the company rebounded from a $65.9 million net loss in the first half of 2009).[24]

Pacific Rubiales announces corporate name change to Pacific Exploration and Production Corporation to reflect a broader focus in Latin America

Aug 14, 2015, 06:00 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TORONTO, Aug. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ - Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (TSX: PRE) (BVC: PREC) announced today that it is changing its corporate name to Pacific Exploration and Production Corporation. The name change reflects the Company's broader focus in Latin America as the Company's production base continues to be diversified away from the Rubiales Field.
The new name emphasizes the Company's strategy which is focused on sustainable growth in production & reserves and cash generation within a diversified portfolio of assets. The Company asset base is allocated across seven countries including Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Brazil, Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Belize. The opening up of the Mexican energy sector to foreign investment provides a very large opportunity that is well aligned with the Company's core expertise and track record in light and heavy oil exploration and development, as the leading independent Latin American focused E&P company.
Ronald Pantin, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented:
"This name change represents a significant milestone for the Company, reflecting that we have in fact replaced production from the Rubiales Field. Total net production after royalties has grown from well under 100,000 boe/d to current levels of just over 150,000 boe/d, despite a 14% decline in production from the Rubiales Field in 2014. We have more than replaced the Rubiales production from a combination of other heavy oil production in Colombia, light and medium oil production in Colombia and Peru, and natural gas production in Colombia. A large portfolio of undeveloped reserves plus resources underpin further potential production growth beyond 2016."
The new name is effective immediately, and will be implemented throughout the Company in the 2015 calendar year. The Company's new website can be found at www.pacific.energy 
The Company has made an application to the Toronto Stock Exchange for its approval of the name change and has received conditional approval subject to the submission of the required final documentation.
The Company's common shares will continue to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and La Bolsa de Valores de Colombia under the ticker symbols PRE, and PREC, respectively.
About Pacific Exploration & Production:
Pacific Exploration & Production is a Canadian public company and a leading explorer and producer of natural gas and crude oil, with operations focused in Latin America. The Company has a diversified portfolio of assets with interests in approximately 90 exploration and production blocks in seven countries including Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Brazil, Guyana, Papua New Guinea and Belize. The Company's strategy is focused on sustainable growth in production & reserves and cash generation. Pacific Exploration & Production is committed to conducting business safely, in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.
The Company's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and La Bolsa de Valores de Colombia under the ticker symbols PRE, and PREC, respectively.

 Pacific Rubiales Energy Is Safe From Bankruptcy - Pacific Exploration & Production Corp. (OTCMKTS:PEGFQ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Pacific Rubiales Energy Is Safe From BankruptcyMar.19.15 | About: Pacific Exploration (PEGFQ) Laurent Cadotte Long only, long-term horizon, contrarian, valuelaurentcadotte.comSummaryThe financing costs for 2015 have come down to $235MM.Realized price are higher than the WTI spot price.Aggressive hedging strategy (60% of production) will minimize liquidity risks in 2015.PEGFF needs a Brent price of under 40$/bbl to run out of cash.From now on, with bankruptcy out the question, any news will be good news.I wrote an article on March 17 about Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (OTC:PEGFF) and promised to deliver an update after today's release of the annual report. Here is the update on the PEGFF.
The article will be divided in five segments: the analysis of the March 17th model, the debt profile of the company, the realized price of oil and the sales for the year, and finally the cash on hand at the end of 2015 according to the oil price. Get a good cup of coffee, this is a wild ride.
Model analysis
Let me compare my model form my last article to the latest annual report:

(Source: Fourth Quarter & Year End 2014 Results, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements)
Indeed, according to the year end results, there was $2.4B of cash spent on CAPEX instead of $2.3B listed in the March presentation (March 2015, Slide 15). Furthermore, the sale of the pipeline asset was not completed in the fourth quarter and there is still $80MM to be received in the first quarter of 2015. In summary, the model was doing fine, as the magnitude of errors are close to 5%.
Debt profile
According to the conference call this morning (4Q & Full Year 2014 Conference Call, Slide 15), there is no debt repayment until the fourth quarter of 2016. On the other hand, the credit facility (the last line of defense as management calls it) is fully drawn. The defense is already down.
According to latest financial statements, financing costs were $261MM in 2014. The debt listed as other in the statements was repaid with the $1B credit facility as said earlier. Thus, we can subtract $56MM from the financing costs, which gives us financing costs of $205MM for the year. Finally, I add the cost of the credit facility (LIBOR plus 2.25%). The current 52 week high LIBOR rate in USD is 0.72% according to the WSJ. I will say the credit facility will bear interests of 3% a year, or $30MM a year. We can see that the decision to take the money from the credit facility was justified.

In summary the total financing costs for the year 2015 is estimated at $235MM with no debt maturing before the fourth quarter of 2016.
Realized price of oil and 2015 sales
How much money can PEGFF receive for each of its barrel of oil? With the hedging policy in place and price differentials between the WTI and the Brent spot price, this is a tough question to answer. Although the March presentation told us the hedging would affect up to 30% of production (March 2015, Slide 22), we learned this morning that it would affect about 60% of production.
According to the presentation of this morning conference call, the net production is already at 153Mboe/d year-to-date, compared to a 2014 net average production of 147Mboe/d. The estimated net production for this year of 155Mboe/d is at the center of the guidance given by the management team. It will be used to estimate sales throughout the year. Here are the barrels of oil equivalent produced for each quarters by PEGFF with a stable net production:

The other important question to answer is where PEGFF can sell its oil. If it goes to the US, the pricing will be lower because of the lower WTI versus Brent price. Consequently, the price of oil will be higher anywhere else around the world because of the Brent price. According to the presentation of this morning, we learned on Slide 7 that the price realized year-to-date was around 50.20$/boe. In that period, according to the EIA (EIA WTI Spot Price, EIA Brent Spot Price), the average Brent price was 53.78$/bbl and the average WTI price was 49.40$/bbl. Therefore, the realized price per barrel of oil produced from PEGFF is 6.66% lower than the Brent price and 1.62% higher than the WTI price.

There are 12.1MMbbl hedged based on the WTI price and 19.6MMbbl hedged based on the Brent price against a total net production of 56.575MMboe. We learned from the presentation this morning (Slide 7) that for the full year of 2014, 18% of the oil produced was sold to the US. Therefore, this brings us to the first hypothesis of this article:
Hypothesis: 18% of the net production will be sold to the US at the WTI spot price or the floor price of the WTI hedging in place. The rest of the net production (82%) will be sold at the Brent spot price minus 7% or the floor price of the Brent hedging in place.

Source: 4Q & Full Year 2014 Conference Call, Slide 13
It is estimated that the oil sales with hedging in place will bring in $1,712MM for PEGFF. In line with our hypothesis, there will be around 1.07MMboe for sale in the US in the third quarter and 26.79MMboe for non-US sale throughout the year.
In summary, the variables for the sales this year will be the WTI spot price in the third quarter and the Brent spot price throughout the year.
Cash on hand at the end of 2015
The cash that PEGFF will have at the end of the year will be computed according to the WTI spot price in the third quarter (July to September) and the Brent price throughout the year.

Source: 4Q & Full Year 2014 Conference Call, Slide 11
This process is repeated at intervals of 5$/bbl. The WTI price in the third quarter of 50$/bbl will not be changed during this analysis, as there is a very small amount of non-hedged volume (1MMboe) of oil for sale in the US.

Therefore, as the WTI spot price is not significant anymore, the investor should focus on the pricing of Brent.

Remember that this is the change in cash during the year 2015. Thus, with PEGFF starting with over $300MM in cash according to the latest financial statement, the average Brent spot price throughout the year would need to fall under 40$/bbl for PEGFF to be in real trouble.
Outlook and conclusion
The article I wrote on March 17 was portraying a darker picture of PEGFF. There is one component changing this perception: production hedging. The aggressive hedging of about 60% of net production implemented by the management team for the year is a true game changer. This strategy will surely be of a huge help to ride the bearish oil market this year.
With the use of the credit facility, cash available at the end of 2014 of over $300MM and the announcement of an asset sale of $200M (which is a fair price according to the last sale of 36% working interest), PEGFF has, in my opinion, absolutely no chance of going bankrupt.
However, this analysis include aggressive cost cutting, including lowering the production costs of 23%, the transportation costs of 8%, the diluent costs of 6% and the general and administrative costs of 37%.
I won't advise to go short on this stock. From now on, any news will be good news.
In summary, the main risks for this company are:

Brent pricing throughout the year
Realization of aggressive cost cutting

Nonetheless, I decide to put my money where my mouth is. I will advise to take a very small position in this stock. Then, if the Brent pricing becomes more favorable to the oil producers and if the cost cutting measures become a reality, I would add more.

Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Investor Update: Those Who Lost Money in ForceField Energy

Andrew Stoltmann /
Chelsea Financial Services, forcefield energy, fraud, gerald cocuzzo, investment fraud, lawsuit, legend securities, maroof miyana, meyers associates, naveed khan, newbridge securities, pranav patel, richard brown, SEC, sunsi energies / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Update For Investors Who Lost Oil and Gas-Related Investments With Red River Securities

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.

Pacific Exploration and Production is a Canadian petroleum exploration and production company in the business of heavy crude oil and natural gas. Its focus is on Colombia and Peru where it holds numerous properties including 38 blocks in the Llanos, Sucre-Co Lower Magdalena and Cesar Valley, Rancheria, Upper and Middle Magdalena Valley, Putumayo Valley, Ucayali and Maranon basins.
In early 2010 it was the largest independent oil company operating in South America and in terms of private companies the fastest growing one in Colombia.[1] In 2011 it was responsible for 41% of the growth in oil production in Colombia. In mid-2015 it changed its name from Pacific Rubiales to Pacific Exploration and Production, signalling the diminished importance of the Rubiales field in the company's total assets and a broader focus in Latin America.[2][3]

History[edit]
The parent company's origins go back to 1985 to a TSX Venture Exchange listed company called Agincourt Explorations, however the oldest part of the current company with operations in Colombia is Petro Rubiales which began its business in 1982. In 1995 Agincourt Explorations became AGX Resources Corp.; a mineral exploration company focused on Brazil and Canada. After AGX acquired Rubiales Holdings in 2007 from Petro Rubiales it became known as Petro Rubiales Energy Corp. up until 2008 when it merged with Vancouver-based Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd. in a $2.5 billion causing a name change to Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. Less than two weeks after the merger the company delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange.[4] [5] Later in 2008 it acquired Kappa Energy, a Colombian exploration company with licenses to 747,000 acres (3,020 km2) of land which included parts of the lower, middle, and upper Magdalena, Catatumbo, and Llanos basins. The transaction was valued at $168 million and increased Pacific Rubiales' possible reserves by 24.2 million boe. Kappa is now part of division Kappa Energy Holdings.[6] On October 19, 2011 it became engaged in oil drilling activity in northern Guatemala.
In January 2010 the company signed a $190 million deal with Ocensa pipeline to use their pipeline and oil transport infrastructure to transport up to 160 million barrels of oil for a period of ten years.[7]
In September 2010 the company followed through with its promise to focus more on developing assets already mature or low risk and less on exploration in high risk areas by divesting itself of fields within the Buganviles oil and gas block of Colombia. It sold a 29.5% interest in Visure and 25% in Tuqueque to a subsidiary of Peruvian company Petrodorado. Though the deal gives Petrodorado a near joint interest in the Buganviles block (45-49.5%) Pacific Rubiales remains the controlling operator.[8]
On February 1, 2012 Pacific Rubiales Energy became the first Canadian company to receive approval from BM&F Bovespa to issue Brazilian Depository Receipts for trading on the Brazilian stock exchange.
In early 2015 as oil prices were declining, Alejandro Betancourt López of Derwick Associates led an investment group to purchase a 20% share of the company for $290 million. In April 2016, the company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy protection and would begin restructuring.[9]
Properties/Production[edit]
As of December 2011 80% of the company's 407 mboe 2P reserves are in oil with most of the other 20% in natural gas, 317 mboe are proved reserves.[2] On March 28, 2011 gross reserves were at 357.39 million boe 87% of which is net reserves.[10] By June 2011 net proved reserves were 350 million boe up 15% or 40 million barrels in six months.[11] In September 2011 net reserves stood at 341.73 million boe, slightly lower than the previous quarter due to a decline in heavy oil reserves. For the 2011 fiscal year, 75.7% of total field production of 165,446 bbls/d came from the Rubiales/Piriri field (up 34% on the year). Quifa was second at 36,496 bbls/d (up 657%). Share after royalties averaged over 2011; 63% came from Rubiales/Piriri (54,802 bbls/d up 29%), 22% from Quifa (19,181 b/d up 629%), 12% from La Creciente (10,584 b/d up 7% after being up 34% in 2010).[12][13] As of September 30, 2011 net reserves are 341.73 mboe, up from 269 mboe in December 2010.[14]
In 2011 fields that Pacific Rubiales has a joint or majority interest in accounted for just under 20% of Colombia's oil output.[15]
Since October 2010 it also has a working interest in 2 other blocks in the Petén Basin of Guatemala (shared with lamingo Energy Investment (BVI) Ltd., Chx Guatemala Limitada, and Compañía Petrolera del Atlántico).[16]
It shares joint ownership in many oil fields and exploration projects in Colombia with Ecopetrol and in Peru with Petrodorado.[17]
Its most valuable assets are the Rubiales (largest in Colombia) and Piriri oil fields in central Colombia which it operates through Meta Petroleum, a division of subsidiary Rubiales Holdings Limited (RHL). RHL has been 100% owned by pacific Rubiales since 2007 when it purchased the remaining 25% of outstanding shares.[18] Through acquisitions (Pacific Coal S.A.) it plans to enter the coal and asphalite production market.[19]
Colombia - properties jointly owned with Ecopetrol

Rubiales, Piriri fields - covers 72,839 acres (294.77 km2) of land 148 km from Puerto Gaitan. Oil was first discovered there in 1982 but production didn't begin until 1988 when the Rubiales risk participation contract was signed. Operations are conducted through subsidiary Meta Petroleum. The Rubiales oil field which has become the largest in Colombia was neglected before being acquired by Pacific Rubiales.[19]

- total field production as of September 2012 is 240,975 b/d, 116,285 b/d of which is its share before royalties. At the end of 2011 reserves stood at 407 million barrels that includes those considered proven-possible.[2] The data is independently verified.[20][21]

First production from Quifa North and Sabanero happened in the last quarter of 2011.
Rubiales had represented as much as 88% of the company's 2P reserves in terms of net working interest but due to a tripling in reserves at Quifa and the upgrading of resources at field CPE-6, by December 2011 Rubiales only accounted for 29% of reserves.[22]
Llanos basin (reserves estimated to be over 4.5 billion barrels for the whole basin)[23] - quifa field (ownership at 60%)
The intangible assets held by the company are Colombian pipeline system usage rights.[24]

Peru - Exploration and development projects are jointly owned with Petrodorado

Ucayali Basin, Maranon Basin[25]

- Production in Peru began in 2012, average production during the September 2012 quarter was 2,845 bbl/d (1,394 net). The output is attributable to a 49% interest in Block-Z1.[26]
Guatemala -In the Petén Basin, southeast of major oil fields in southern Mexico. Has the option to raise its share to 55% by investing as much as US $25.875 million in exploration and drilling.[16]
The company has experienced a steady rise in production over the last few years. Average total field production in the third quarter of 2012 was 243,820 b/d which is 24,684 b/d higher than the previous period. Ecopetrol's 50% interest in the largest field and internal consumption cost the company roughly half that, bringing its share down to 117,679 b/d (up 14,722 b/d) and 97,142 b/d after royalties (up 9,983 b/d). For the first quarter of 2011 output was 196,272 boe/d 34% more than the year before; after royalties production was up 51% to about 80,000 boe/d, production increases came from the same sources as in 2010 (Rubiales, Quifa) in addition to new production from La Creciente (to 9,700 boe/d).[10] In early 2010 total gross daily production (not including royalties based on output levels and crude oil prices) was around 130,000 boe/d compared to about 83,000 boe/d in 2009. In 2009 about 8.6 million barrels of oil it produced was exported while 1.6 million barrels of oil was used domestically in Colombia.[27] In the first three months of 2011 the company sold 26% more oil than in the corresponding period in 2010 (7.447 million boe or about 83,000 boe/d). Because it is producing below a certain royalties threshold, nearly all gross production before royalties coming from La Creciente is kept after royalties.
Criticism[edit]
Pacific Rubiales has been the focus of various controversies over the years, ranging from allegations of collusion with paramilitary death-squads, suppression of labor rights, manipulation of stock prices, and production figures, besides harassment of journalists through ad revenue pressure upon media companies to drop negative coverage.[28][29][30]
Regarding the first, it has been alleged that paramilitary forces took some of that land by illegal means before transferring ownership over to Kappa Energy, a company Pacific Rubiales acquired in 2008 (total reserves associated with Kappa Energy represent only a fraction of Pacific Rubiales total).[31] The complaints go back to 2001, prosecution claims that the real owners of the land were forcefully displaced, in response the defence is calling the land transfer agreements valid, that the family's demands are always changing, and is disputing the validity of their claims (only one of them actually lived on the land). Working conditions have also been criticised; according to journalist Alfred Molano some workers live in tents of as many as twenty people. [1] [2].
In 2012 the company came under criticism for beginning oil exploration activities on land inhabited by the Matsés indigenous people of Peru.[32] It was argued that the deforestation of hundreds of seismic testing lines and the drilling of test wells would threaten water sources depended upon by the tribe, and that the activity would also risk exposing uncontacted tribes in the surrounding areas to disease.[33] Later that year, a Colombian journalist covering protests against the company's operations died following police mistreatment.[34][35][36]
Sales[edit]
2012 - During the third quarter of the year the company sold 89,045 b/d of oil and 10,775 b/d of natural gas for a total of 99,820 b/d (down from 101,533) at an average sales price of $95.13 (up from $88.66). The company purchases some of the oil that it sells.[37]
2011 - Over the first nine months of the year, the company transported 120,172 bpd of oil through various pipeline systems, two thirds of which went through the ocensa pipeline and another 14,204 bpd via trucks. For the third quarter total field production was 219,136 bpd up 52%. Its share net of internal consumption after royalties was 87,159 bpd up 54.5%, 30,577 bpd of which came from new production Rubiales and Quifa (up from 19,241 bpd from 1,754 bpd). At an average sales price of $94.67/bbl (up 39%) that gave it revenue of $2.369 billion (up 107%).[14]
2010 - For the 2010 year total net production was 56,974 boe/d, 67% higher than in 2009; Most of the increase came from growth at the Rubiales heavy oil field.[23][38][39] Although revenue was 173% higher in the first half of 2010 than in the first half of 2009 net income continued to be weighed down by depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange losses (though the company rebounded from a $65.9 million net loss in the first half of 2009).[24]

Pacific Exploration and Production is a Canadian petroleum exploration and production company in the business of heavy crude oil and natural gas. Its focus is on Colombia and Peru where it holds numerous properties including 38 blocks in the Llanos, Sucre-Co Lower Magdalena and Cesar Valley, Rancheria, Upper and Middle Magdalena Valley, Putumayo Valley, Ucayali and Maranon basins.
In early 2010 it was the largest independent oil company operating in South America and in terms of private companies the fastest growing one in Colombia.[1] In 2011 it was responsible for 41% of the growth in oil production in Colombia. In mid-2015 it changed its name from Pacific Rubiales to Pacific Exploration and Production, signalling the diminished importance of the Rubiales field in the company's total assets and a broader focus in Latin America.[2][3]

History[edit]
The parent company's origins go back to 1985 to a TSX Venture Exchange listed company called Agincourt Explorations, however the oldest part of the current company with operations in Colombia is Petro Rubiales which began its business in 1982. In 1995 Agincourt Explorations became AGX Resources Corp.; a mineral exploration company focused on Brazil and Canada. After AGX acquired Rubiales Holdings in 2007 from Petro Rubiales it became known as Petro Rubiales Energy Corp. up until 2008 when it merged with Vancouver-based Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd. in a $2.5 billion causing a name change to Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. Less than two weeks after the merger the company delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange.[4] [5] Later in 2008 it acquired Kappa Energy, a Colombian exploration company with licenses to 747,000 acres (3,020 km2) of land which included parts of the lower, middle, and upper Magdalena, Catatumbo, and Llanos basins. The transaction was valued at $168 million and increased Pacific Rubiales' possible reserves by 24.2 million boe. Kappa is now part of division Kappa Energy Holdings.[6] On October 19, 2011 it became engaged in oil drilling activity in northern Guatemala.
In January 2010 the company signed a $190 million deal with Ocensa pipeline to use their pipeline and oil transport infrastructure to transport up to 160 million barrels of oil for a period of ten years.[7]
In September 2010 the company followed through with its promise to focus more on developing assets already mature or low risk and less on exploration in high risk areas by divesting itself of fields within the Buganviles oil and gas block of Colombia. It sold a 29.5% interest in Visure and 25% in Tuqueque to a subsidiary of Peruvian company Petrodorado. Though the deal gives Petrodorado a near joint interest in the Buganviles block (45-49.5%) Pacific Rubiales remains the controlling operator.[8]
On February 1, 2012 Pacific Rubiales Energy became the first Canadian company to receive approval from BM&F Bovespa to issue Brazilian Depository Receipts for trading on the Brazilian stock exchange.
In early 2015 as oil prices were declining, Alejandro Betancourt López of Derwick Associates led an investment group to purchase a 20% share of the company for $290 million. In April 2016, the company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy protection and would begin restructuring.[9]
Properties/Production[edit]
As of December 2011 80% of the company's 407 mboe 2P reserves are in oil with most of the other 20% in natural gas, 317 mboe are proved reserves.[2] On March 28, 2011 gross reserves were at 357.39 million boe 87% of which is net reserves.[10] By June 2011 net proved reserves were 350 million boe up 15% or 40 million barrels in six months.[11] In September 2011 net reserves stood at 341.73 million boe, slightly lower than the previous quarter due to a decline in heavy oil reserves. For the 2011 fiscal year, 75.7% of total field production of 165,446 bbls/d came from the Rubiales/Piriri field (up 34% on the year). Quifa was second at 36,496 bbls/d (up 657%). Share after royalties averaged over 2011; 63% came from Rubiales/Piriri (54,802 bbls/d up 29%), 22% from Quifa (19,181 b/d up 629%), 12% from La Creciente (10,584 b/d up 7% after being up 34% in 2010).[12][13] As of September 30, 2011 net reserves are 341.73 mboe, up from 269 mboe in December 2010.[14]
In 2011 fields that Pacific Rubiales has a joint or majority interest in accounted for just under 20% of Colombia's oil output.[15]
Since October 2010 it also has a working interest in 2 other blocks in the Petén Basin of Guatemala (shared with lamingo Energy Investment (BVI) Ltd., Chx Guatemala Limitada, and Compañía Petrolera del Atlántico).[16]
It shares joint ownership in many oil fields and exploration projects in Colombia with Ecopetrol and in Peru with Petrodorado.[17]
Its most valuable assets are the Rubiales (largest in Colombia) and Piriri oil fields in central Colombia which it operates through Meta Petroleum, a division of subsidiary Rubiales Holdings Limited (RHL). RHL has been 100% owned by pacific Rubiales since 2007 when it purchased the remaining 25% of outstanding shares.[18] Through acquisitions (Pacific Coal S.A.) it plans to enter the coal and asphalite production market.[19]
Colombia - properties jointly owned with Ecopetrol

Rubiales, Piriri fields - covers 72,839 acres (294.77 km2) of land 148 km from Puerto Gaitan. Oil was first discovered there in 1982 but production didn't begin until 1988 when the Rubiales risk participation contract was signed. Operations are conducted through subsidiary Meta Petroleum. The Rubiales oil field which has become the largest in Colombia was neglected before being acquired by Pacific Rubiales.[19]

- total field production as of September 2012 is 240,975 b/d, 116,285 b/d of which is its share before royalties. At the end of 2011 reserves stood at 407 million barrels that includes those considered proven-possible.[2] The data is independently verified.[20][21]

First production from Quifa North and Sabanero happened in the last quarter of 2011.
Rubiales had represented as much as 88% of the company's 2P reserves in terms of net working interest but due to a tripling in reserves at Quifa and the upgrading of resources at field CPE-6, by December 2011 Rubiales only accounted for 29% of reserves.[22]
Llanos basin (reserves estimated to be over 4.5 billion barrels for the whole basin)[23] - quifa field (ownership at 60%)
The intangible assets held by the company are Colombian pipeline system usage rights.[24]

Peru - Exploration and development projects are jointly owned with Petrodorado

Ucayali Basin, Maranon Basin[25]

- Production in Peru began in 2012, average production during the September 2012 quarter was 2,845 bbl/d (1,394 net). The output is attributable to a 49% interest in Block-Z1.[26]
Guatemala -In the Petén Basin, southeast of major oil fields in southern Mexico. Has the option to raise its share to 55% by investing as much as US $25.875 million in exploration and drilling.[16]
The company has experienced a steady rise in production over the last few years. Average total field production in the third quarter of 2012 was 243,820 b/d which is 24,684 b/d higher than the previous period. Ecopetrol's 50% interest in the largest field and internal consumption cost the company roughly half that, bringing its share down to 117,679 b/d (up 14,722 b/d) and 97,142 b/d after royalties (up 9,983 b/d). For the first quarter of 2011 output was 196,272 boe/d 34% more than the year before; after royalties production was up 51% to about 80,000 boe/d, production increases came from the same sources as in 2010 (Rubiales, Quifa) in addition to new production from La Creciente (to 9,700 boe/d).[10] In early 2010 total gross daily production (not including royalties based on output levels and crude oil prices) was around 130,000 boe/d compared to about 83,000 boe/d in 2009. In 2009 about 8.6 million barrels of oil it produced was exported while 1.6 million barrels of oil was used domestically in Colombia.[27] In the first three months of 2011 the company sold 26% more oil than in the corresponding period in 2010 (7.447 million boe or about 83,000 boe/d). Because it is producing below a certain royalties threshold, nearly all gross production before royalties coming from La Creciente is kept after royalties.
Criticism[edit]
Pacific Rubiales has been the focus of various controversies over the years, ranging from allegations of collusion with paramilitary death-squads, suppression of labor rights, manipulation of stock prices, and production figures, besides harassment of journalists through ad revenue pressure upon media companies to drop negative coverage.[28][29][30]
Regarding the first, it has been alleged that paramilitary forces took some of that land by illegal means before transferring ownership over to Kappa Energy, a company Pacific Rubiales acquired in 2008 (total reserves associated with Kappa Energy represent only a fraction of Pacific Rubiales total).[31] The complaints go back to 2001, prosecution claims that the real owners of the land were forcefully displaced, in response the defence is calling the land transfer agreements valid, that the family's demands are always changing, and is disputing the validity of their claims (only one of them actually lived on the land). Working conditions have also been criticised; according to journalist Alfred Molano some workers live in tents of as many as twenty people. [1] [2].
In 2012 the company came under criticism for beginning oil exploration activities on land inhabited by the Matsés indigenous people of Peru.[32] It was argued that the deforestation of hundreds of seismic testing lines and the drilling of test wells would threaten water sources depended upon by the tribe, and that the activity would also risk exposing uncontacted tribes in the surrounding areas to disease.[33] Later that year, a Colombian journalist covering protests against the company's operations died following police mistreatment.[34][35][36]
Sales[edit]
2012 - During the third quarter of the year the company sold 89,045 b/d of oil and 10,775 b/d of natural gas for a total of 99,820 b/d (down from 101,533) at an average sales price of $95.13 (up from $88.66). The company purchases some of the oil that it sells.[37]
2011 - Over the first nine months of the year, the company transported 120,172 bpd of oil through various pipeline systems, two thirds of which went through the ocensa pipeline and another 14,204 bpd via trucks. For the third quarter total field production was 219,136 bpd up 52%. Its share net of internal consumption after royalties was 87,159 bpd up 54.5%, 30,577 bpd of which came from new production Rubiales and Quifa (up from 19,241 bpd from 1,754 bpd). At an average sales price of $94.67/bbl (up 39%) that gave it revenue of $2.369 billion (up 107%).[14]
2010 - For the 2010 year total net production was 56,974 boe/d, 67% higher than in 2009; Most of the increase came from growth at the Rubiales heavy oil field.[23][38][39] Although revenue was 173% higher in the first half of 2010 than in the first half of 2009 net income continued to be weighed down by depreciation, amortization and foreign exchange losses (though the company rebounded from a $65.9 million net loss in the first half of 2009).[24]
