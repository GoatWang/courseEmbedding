limited liability company on July 16, 2012, pursuant to the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (6 Del.C.

“ Delaware LLC Act ”) by the filing of its
Certificate of Formation (as amended, the “
Certificate ”) with the Secretary of State;

WHEREAS, HII and the Company have
entered into an underwriting agreement (the “ IPO
Underwriting Agreement ”) with the several underwriters
(the “ IPO Underwriters ”) named therein,
providing for the initial public offering (the “ IPO
”) of 5,066,667 Class A Shares (as defined below) of
HII;

WHEREAS, prior to the execution
hereof, HPI and HPIS were the sole members of the Company (the
“ Prior Members ”) under the Second Amended and
Restated Liability Company Agreement of the Company dated as of
November 7, 2012 (the “ Prior LLC Agreement
”) pursuant to which the Company has heretofore been
governed;

WHEREAS, in connection with the IPO,
it is contemplated that (i) immediately prior to consummation
of the IPO (the “ Effective Time ”), all of the
limited liability company interests in the Company held by the
Prior Members (the “ Prior LLC Interests ”) will
be converted into the number of Series B Membership Interests (as
defined below) set forth opposite each Prior Member’s name in
Exhibit A hereto, (ii) at the Effective Time, all of the
shares of common stock of HII held by the Prior Members will be
converted into the number of Class B Shares (as defined below)
equal to the number of Series B Membership Interests issued to such
Prior Member, (iii) immediately after the IPO, HII will
contribute the net proceeds thereof to the Company in exchange for
5,066,667 Series A Membership Interests (as defined below), and
(iv) if and to the extent the IPO Underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option to purchase Optional Securities (as defined
below) pursuant to Section 3 of the IPO Underwriting
Agreement,


HII will issue additional Class A Shares
and use the net proceeds thereof to purchase an equal number of
Series B Membership Interests and Class B Shares from HPI, which
Series B Membership Interests will immediately thereafter be
recapitalized into Series A Membership Interests and which Class B
Shares will immediately thereafter be cancelled (collectively, the
“ IPO Transactions ”); and

WHEREAS, the Prior Members desire to
amend and restate the Prior LLC Agreement as set forth herein to

(c) The Book Value of property
distributed to a Member shall be the Fair Market Value of such

Capital Accounts pursuant to Treas. Reg. §1.704-1

connection therewith in accordance with the preceding provisions of

the Company, immediately prior to such repurchase or redemption of
Class A Shares, to redeem a corresponding number of Series A
Membership Interests held by HII (determined based upon the
Exchange Rate then in effect), at an aggregate redemption price
