La Jolla Pharmaceutical: Lost Opportunity, Insider Questions Should Chop Valuation By Well Over Half
by Sonya Colberg, Senior Editor - 7/13/2015 10:07:33 AM
	                         
                         






			*Executive Summary

			*The stock primarily owes its price to enthusiasm over insider buying. However, that insider’s large block trade orders sparked a market manipulation investigation that led to his broker being sanctioned, temporarily losing his license and paying tens of thousands in fines.

			*Though La Jolla had to shelve its most promising drug candidate, analysts haven’t revised price targets to reflect the massive decline in market opportunity.

			*With La Jolla’s history of missed, terrible earnings, even bullish analysts anticipate horrible earnings into the foreseeable future.

			*With little real institutional interest, anyway, more shares recently have been sold out than new positions added.

			*Our calculations suggest the remaining market opportunity for La Jolla is a fraction of analysts’ projections.

			***

The market has recently blasted La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co. (NASDAQ: LJPC) shares to mystifying levels, thanks primarily to insider buying.

			But that insider's stock trades previously sparked a market manipulation investigation that left him unscathed and his broker sanctioned.

			That key inside buyer is La Jolla's chairman of the board, Kevin C. Tang. Mr. Tang, is also managing partner of Tang Capital, a firm named by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a relief defendant in a 2009 lawsuit alleging insider trading, fraud and deceit in securities trading. That lawsuit resulted in a $382,024 fine against Tang Capital's founder Chen Tang.

			Mr. Kevin Tang, Tang Capital and several of his other entities own 2.6 million shares or ~16 percent of La Jolla's stock.

			The company hasn't responded to our request for comment but investors may find other viewpoints here.

			This situation makes us think of Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary's comment:


				"When you're an investor, you can look at the quantitative and qualitative elements of an investment, but there's a third aspect: What you feel in your gut."


			There's a bad feeling in our gut about La Jolla. And here are some quantitative and qualitative reasons why…

			*The Tang connection

			La Jolla director Kevin Tang ordered trades that spurred an investigation into market manipulation. On appeal, the SEC upheld findings that Mr. Tang's broker engaged in a manipulative scheme and caused his brokerage firm's books and records to be inaccurate.

			Mr. Tang and his long-time broker friend Edward Brokaw testified about how the stock broker carried out Mr. Tang's orders for several big block trades of Monogram Biosciences.

			At the time, Mr. Tang was not yet a La Jolla director and his hedge fund owned ~3.3 million shares of Monogram (MGRM) and ~18 million CVR units that May in 2006. Mr. Brokaw and his family also owned ~215,000 CVR units.

			The rather fascinating November 2013 SEC document describing the case that the broker regulatory group, FINRA, built against Mr. Brokaw is here. We hit the highlights below:

*"Take the ******* thing down … a dollar?"

			Here are some entertaining, and telling, out-takes from recorded conversations, plus background:


				"The next trading day, May 22, Tang gave Brokaw another order to sell two blocks of 50,000 MGRM shares, again with one block each near the open and close, and again to sell them quickly and aggressively.



				One of Brokaw's assistants, William Ewing, relayed the order to trader David Zitman ...



				During that telephone conversation, Ewing told Zitman that Tang wanted to sell Monogram's stock "hard" at the opening of the market and then began to explain that Tang "owns the rights . . . They're pricing the rights off the stock . . . ."



				At that point, Ewing testified, Brokaw, who was listening to the call, signaled for Ewing to "knock it off" by swiping a hand across his throat.



				Ewing therefore told Zitman, "Sorry, sorry, enough said, I'm not, that's, I'm not supposed to be going into that. Anyways, he's trying to, he wants to sell."



				Zitman entered the morning order into the firm's computer system to be executed by the equity trader. Zitman then called Brokaw to confirm the trading instructions.



				During that conversation, Zitman asked if he should "[t]ake the f[---]ing thing down (inaudible) a dollar?" Brokaw replied, "Yeah, 50 cents, yes."



				Zitman pressed, "He wants it to be done-and if I take the thing down to $1.50 and it bounces back to $2, he doesn't care?"



				Brokaw confirmed, "No, right."



				Tang's order was subsequently executed in increments at prices declining from $1.95 to $1.91."


			Mr. Brokaw pushed traders to "hammer" Monogram stock for as little as one penny. He explained to a trader that lowering Monogram's stock price would increase the value of Monogram's CVRs. He described the trades as a battle of "good versus evil."

*"He could ******* be going away for a long time doing that."

			The next day, Mr. Brokaw received Mr. Tang's orders to again sell 50,000 shares of Monogram stock at the open and close of the market. This was his third block order in four days. Mr. Zitman sprang into action again, but not without expressing concerns about Mr. Tang's suspicious orders.

			The scene is described below, along with more recorded conversation:


				"Zitman entered the order, which was filled within seconds of the market open at an average price of $1.88. Zitman called Brokaw to confirm the sales, and Brokaw told Zitman to sell another 50,000 at the close.



				At 3:50 p.m., Brokaw confirmed the order again with Zitman, telling him that Tang wanted him to execute the order "with a minute to go and spread it out a little bit . . . hit the bids . . . ."


			This heightened concerns for Mr. Zitman, who raised questions about the legality of Mr. Tang's orders:


				Zitman: What, he's trying to mark the close? (Note: "Marking the close" by buying or selling shares near the close of the market is considered one sign of a market manipulative practice)



				Brokaw: Yeah.



				Zitman: You should, you should-he, he could f[---]ing be going away for a long time doing that.



				Brokaw: Really?



				Zitman: Yeah. You can't mark the close. It's f[---]ing illegal.



				Brokaw: Eh, I didn't think so.



				Zitman: Yeah, f[---] it, I, no. I'm not marking the close for him.



				Brokaw: No, no, no.



				Zitman: I'm not giving up my f[---]ing license.



				Brokaw: No, no, no, me neither. No, just sell 50 on the close."


*Orders refused when staffers speak up

			A couple of other traders expressed concerns about the rationale for Mr. Tang's trades.

			One trader even took the matter to the firm's compliance officer, who said, "It doesn't sound right. We're going to - I don't want you trading or transacting in Monogram with that client going forward."

			Mr. Zitman and Mr. Brokaw later discussed Mr. Tang's "suspicious" trades:


				"According to tape recordings of that conversation, Brokaw responded that "they're a little worried about the way the orders are coming in, and . . . I said . . . I hear you, but you know what? This is the way this guy wants to trade."



				Zitman expressed concern that the trades could nevertheless "be construed as a little bit suspect," to which Brokaw replied, "[Y]ou know what? It's a free country."



				Zitman responded, "No, it's not. That's my issue. Someone could walk in here and say, hey, you have a pattern of selling the first minute and selling the last . . . minute."



				When Brokaw replied, "So what?" Zitman explained that 'there could be a compliance issue.'"


			Mr. Tang testified in his buddy's disciplinary hearing that, if the CVRs (contingent value rights, which are like options) were fully valued at the end of the pricing period, his Tang Capital Partners fund would hold CVRs worth more than $16 million.

*As for Mr. Tang, here's the kicker described in the SEC document…


				"Unlike the hearing panel, which did not find credible Tang's testimony about his reasons for the seemingly manipulative trades, the NAC credited Tang's testimony about his trades.



				"The NAC thus found that FINRA staff had "set forth insufficient evidence proving that [Tang's] transactions were manipulative."


			On appeal, the National Adjudicatory Council reversed Mr. Brokaw's market manipulation finding by FINRA but did find Mr. Brokaw violated his ethical duty by not adequately questioning Mr. Tang's orders.

			Ultimately, Mr. Brokaw was fined $30,000 and his broker license was suspended for one year, until January 2015.

			Mr. Kevin Tang's transactions ultimately lacked sufficient evidence to prove they were manipulative. But the deal certainly doesn't pass the sniff test.

			*Damage control saves stock price

			We contend Mr. Tang's funds' recent purchases of La Jolla shares is damage-control. He is well aware that La Jolla was forced to drop its previous lead drug candidate after a lupus nephritis study bombed in 2009. The stock price bombed, too.

			The stock was delisted and moved to the OTC Bulletin Board on March 4, 2010. A transfusion in the form of a private stock offering the following May barely revived the company, followed by a 1-for-100 reverse stock split. It ultimately took a 1-for-50 reverse stock split in January 2014 for La Jolla to return to the NASDAQ.

			The chart below graphically shows what happened to La Jolla's stock after its 2009 drug candidate got shelved. The stock lost nearly 90 percent of its value, plunging to $0.26 per share.



			(Source: Morningstar)

			The chart below shows what happened recently when its latest top drug candidate got shelved May 8 and the market learned that Mr. Tang's fund had jumped in and bought stock June 22 and June 26.



			(Source: Morningstar)

*Established institutions are not very interested

			But when we ask who else is buying, we hear crickets. Though many Class A institutional funds have been rushing to add biotechs to their portfolios, their interest in La Jolla has been scattered and minimal - shown here.

			While some small institutional types have bought recently, share-wise, there have been a lot more positions sold out than new positions established in La Jolla.

			Also, let's take a look at a NASDAQ stock consultant chart that summarizes … yikes! … where La Jolla stock stands in regard to bullish and bearish trends.

			(Source: NASDAQ)

*Clinical candidates? Just one - and not all it's cracked up to be

			La Jolla pulled the plug on its pair of star candidates when it couldn't address FDA's rigorous requirements (and why was the company caught off-guard that the product would be held to - gasp - expensive FDA standards? Maybe it was trying to squeeze every dime out of average shareholders while hyped hope persisted). The drop to one candidate is nicely described, here.

			Interestingly, the key booted product is the kidney disease candidate GCS-100 whose rights La Jolla acquired in 2012 from director Kevin Tang's and CEO George Tidmarsh's former company. So that boot must have been hard to swallow.

			Regardless, La Jolla is now hitched to its only clinical-stage product, LJPC-501, for hypotension or very low blood pressure.

			La Jolla is now recruiting patients for a phase III study to determine if LJPC-501 increases blood pressure. The study is expected to be complete in September 2016.

			More red flags join the pile at this point.

			Analysts apparently haven't changed their price targets to reflect the loss of GCS-100. In the chart below, also note there's likely little upside considering that La Jolla shares are trading ~$31 - right in the middle target range of $28-$33.



			(Source: Yahoo Finance)

			The problem is that the analysts' price targets erroneously assume the former leading candidate, GCS-100, is alive and well and likely to reach commercial success …not booted to the curb.

			An analyst report released to clients at the end of March notes high commercial potential for the booted product. And "limited commercial" potential for the remaining product, LJPC-501.

			An interesting side-note describes some limitations, noting mortality benefits or strong cost/benefit rationale are key to doctors accepting the drugs - "particularly with effective, cheap, generic hypotensive alternatives" available.

			The Jeffries report states its $25 price target is based on $17 per share for LJPC-501 and $8 per share for the shelved product.

			So, what happens if the dropped product is erased from the equation?

			La Jolla stock then winds up with a $17 price target - well below the current ~$31 per share!

*Even $17 per share is too high - The potential market is just too small

			Even a $17 share price assumes the drug will enter an overly optimistic vision of the market and enjoy an unusual degree of success.

			We believe the market is rather small for LJPC-501 because, if approved, the drug would be useful only in special cases because there are so many cheap, effective alternatives.

			Some analysts consider the peak sales opportunity in CRH (catecholamine-resistant hypotension) at ~$280 million and higher.

			But we see the peak CRH market opportunity at a fraction of that … $59 million.

			Some analysts estimate 50 percent penetration - more reasonably 10 percent, we believe - even a Jefferies report states "Overall, physicians view current armamentarium of hypotension drugs as adequate in treating severe hypotensive patients." Yet some really bullish analysts estimate 116,000 patients, while we're estimating 75,000 to 105,000 max.

			Also, if it clears clinical trials, LJPC-501 might find some use in limited, special cases of cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis patients can develop potentially fatal conditions such as bleeding, sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome (NYSE:HRS), resulting in progressive kidney failure and sometimes death. But we have to remember, this iffy HRS use is years away because enrollment in the early Phase 1-2 study is just occurring.

			Nevertheless, we're estimating 115,000 patients, 10 percent market penetration, a $10,000 cost (an improbable guesstimate with all kinds of insurance questions) and 35 percent chance of success in this HRS application.

			This puts the cirrhosis use market opportunity at about $40 million.

			So combined, the real potential valuation of La Jolla's remaining drug is ~$100 million.

*Even without removing erroneous assumptions, terrible earnings estimates

			Shareholders' earnings estimates look pathetic, even before accounting for the lost candidates. Check out the estimates below:

			(Source: Yahoo Finance)

			Not surprisingly, those estimates are backed by an equally pathetic earnings history:

(click to enlarge)

			(Source: Yahoo Finance)

*Looming conversion of 8.2 million shares of preferred stock into common stock poses extreme dilution to today's shareholders.

			When the company converts preferred stock and lucky insiders exercise it, the current 15.2 million shares available for trading would shoot to 23.4 million shares.

			This means a ~35 percent dilution to today's shareholders. So the value of today's $31 stock would be diluted to ~$21.

			And the company states it "may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans."

			Thus swinging the ol' dilution hammer again.

Conclusion: Don't be Cinderella

			"Let investors make informed decisions," an exasperated analyst said of the La Jolla situation.

			Indeed, La Jolla struggles with a potential market of under $100 million (who knows whether the drug will even get past trials and the FDA?) and an aggressive insider whose trades sparked a market manipulation investigation - that ultimately left his broker buddy sanctioned, holding a suspended broker's license and a much lighter wallet.

			Stock offerings, private offerings and reverse stock splits have propped up a comatose La Jolla time and again. And, as forewarned, today's prices could easily cough up another dilutive stock offering.

			Indeed, this sucker's grossly overvalued relative to the cash it could possibly ever generate.

			It's kind of like what Warren Buffett said about how investors sometimes "drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball.

			"They know that overstaying the festivities - that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuation relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future - will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice."

			Kick off your glass slippers and run before they bring on the pumpkins and mice … and this stock disintegrates to a very generous ~$10 per share.

Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) up on FDA approval; Greenbackd exits

					Posted in Activist Investors, Net Cash Stocks, Stocks, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA), tagged Activist investment, Liquidating Value, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) on May 8, 2009|
													3 Comments » 


Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VNDA) yesterday announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted marketing approval following its Phase III clinical study of Fanapt™ (iloperidone). Tang Capital Partners has ended its proxy contest by withdrawing its nominations of director candidates for election to VNDA’s Board of Directors and its stockholder proposal to liquidate VNDA. We are closing our position too. The stock ran 900% on the announcement to $10.00 in after-hours trade and closed yesterday at $7.84. We opened the position on March 12, 2009 at $0.78, so we’re up 905.1% on an absolute basis. The S&P500 Index closed at 721.36 on the same day, and closed yesterday at 907.39, which means we’re up 881.7% on a relative basis.
We started following VNDA (see our post archive here) because it was trading below its net cash value and Tang Capital Partners (TCP) had called for the company to “cease operations immediately, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Stockholders.” TCP had filed a preliminary proxy statement for the 2009 Annual Meeting urging stockholders to support TCP’s slate of two director nominees, Kevin C. Tang and Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D. We estimated VNDA’s net cash value to be around $38.6M or $1.45 per share, and believed that the investment turned on TCP’s ability to get control of the board at the Annual Meeting. It seems we were wrong about that. The big run up in the stock occurred because the FDA granted marketing approval of Fanapt™, which demonstrates one of the great things about investing in liquidation plays: good surprises. We generally ascribe zero value to the intangibles, because more often than not, that’s what they’re worth. Very occassionaly, however, the  intangibles are worth something, and purchasers below liquidation value have a free option on them. We’re not going to pretend that we thought it was a real possibility in this instance. As Lefty Gomez liked to say, “I’d rather be lucky than good.”
Here’s the text of the announcement of the FDA approval:
FDA Approves Vanda Pharmaceuticals’ Fanapt for the Treatment of Schizophrenia
Rockville, MD. (May 6, 2009)— Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: VNDA) announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted marketing approval of Fanapt™ (iloperidone) for the acute treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia. The approval was supported by two placebo-controlled Phase III clinical studies comparing Fanapt™ to placebo and active control in patients with schizophrenia, as well as safety data from more than 3,000 patients.
Fanapt™ is a mixed dopamine D2 / serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonist, and belongs to the class of atypical antipsychotics.
“The approval of Fanapt™ marks a new opportunity for many patients with schizophrenia, who experience only partial responses to current therapies, to achieve better control of their symptoms,” remarked Dr. Peter J. Weiden, Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Psychotic Disorders Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “Having Fanapt™ available is a major help for our patients in offering an effective antipsychotic with an excellent side effect profile across a wide range of major tolerability problems associated with other antipsychotic therapies.”
The efficacy of Fanapt™ for the treatment of schizophrenia was supported by two placebo-controlled short-term (4- and 6-week) trials. Both trials enrolled patients who met the DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia, and Fanapt™ was shown to be superior to placebo in controlling symptoms of schizophrenia across doses of 12mg to 24mg per day. The recommended target dose range of Fanapt™ is 12mg to 24 mg per day. Titration to the target dose of 12mg per day can be achieved in 4 days.
Vanda plans to make Fanapt™ available in pharmacies later this year.

And TCP’s withdrawal of its director nominees:
Vanda Pharmaceuticals Announces Withdrawal of Director Nominees and Proposal to Liquidate Submitted by Tang Capital
Rockville, MD. (May 7, 2009) — Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: VNDA) (“Vanda” or the “Company”) announced today that Tang Capital Partners, LP (“TCP”) has ended its proxy contest by withdrawing its nominations of director candidates for election to Vanda’s Board of Directors and its stockholder proposal to liquidate the Company. TCP had previously notified the Company of its intention to solicit proxies for the election of two of its candidates to the Vanda Board at the Company’s 2009 Annual Meeting and for its proposal that the Board take action to liquidate the Company.
Kevin Tang, the managing director of the general partner of TCP, notified Vanda of TCP’s intention not to pursue a proxy contest on May 6, 2009 in an email to Vanda’s Chief Executive Officer, Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, M.D. and Chairman of the Board, Argeris N. Karabelas, Ph.D. TCP’s withdrawal of its nominations and stockholder proposal follows Vanda’s announcement that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration had granted marketing approval of its product, Fanapt™ (iloperidone), for the acute treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia.

Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) Q1 results

					Posted in Activist Investors, Net Cash Stocks, Stocks, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA), tagged Activist investment, Net Cash Stock, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) on April 30, 2009|
													5 Comments » 


Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VNDA) has reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
We’ve been following VNDA (see our post archive here) because it’s trading below its net cash value and Tang Capital Partners (TCP) has called for the company to “cease operations immediately, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Stockholders.” TCP has now filed a preliminary proxy statement for the 2009 Annual Meeting urging stockholders to support TCP’s slate of two director nominees, Kevin C. Tang and Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D. The stock is up 29.5% since we initiated the position to close yesterday at $1.01, giving the company a market capitalization of $24.3M. We initially estimated the net cash value to be around $42.6M or $1.60 per share. We’ve now reduced our estimate of the net cash value to $38.6M or $1.45 per share. The company continues to hemorrhage cash, so the investment turns on TCP’s ability to get control of the board at the Annual Meeting and staunch the bleeding. If TCP cannot get onto the board quickly, the company will continue to burn cash and the investment will be a dud. VNDA has a staggered board, which makes TCP’s task difficult.
The value proposition updated
In the first quarter of 2009 VNDA burned through $3.8M in cash, which reduces our estimate of the net cash value from $42.6M to $38.6M or $1.45 per share (the remaining difference is due to the slight increase in shares on issue). Set out below is our summary balance sheet  (the “Book Value” column shows the assets as they are carried in the financial statements, and the “Liquidating Value” column shows our estimate of the value of the assets in a liquidation):

Conclusion
VNDA continues to be an interesting play. While the stock is up nearly 30% since we initiated the position, it is still trading at a 45% discount to our estimate of its $1.45 per share net cash value. That value is of course deteriorating rapidly, and the challenge for investors is to determine which of two outcomes is more likely: If TCP can get on the board quickly, stop the cash burn and liquidate the company, we’re likely to see a good return. If TCP cannot get onto the board quickly or at all, the company will continue to burn cash and the investment will be a dud. VNDA has a staggered board, so this will make TCP’s task difficult. We’re inclined to maintain our position and see how this plays out.

Tang Capital Partners files proxy statement for VNDA

					Posted in Activist Investors, Net Cash Stocks, Stocks, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA), tagged Activist investment, Liquidating Value, Net Cash Stock, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) on April 8, 2009|

Tang Capital Partners has filed a preliminary proxy statement for the Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VNDA) 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders urging stockholders to support Tang Capital Partners’ slate of two director nominees, Kevin C. Tang and Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D.
We’ve been following VNDA (see our post archive here) because it’s trading below its net cash value and Tang Capital Partners (TCP), has called for the company to “cease operations immediately, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Stockholders.” The stock is up 16.7% since we initiated the position from $0.78 to close yesterday at $0.91, which gives the company a market capitalization of $24.3M. We estimate the net cash value to be around 75% higher at $42.6M or $1.60 per share. The company is hemorrhaging cash, so the investment turns on TCP’s ability to get control and staunch the bleeding. If TCP cannot get onto the board quickly or at all, the company will continue to burn cash and the investment will be a dud. VNDA has a staggered board, so this will make TCP’s task difficult.
The Background and reasons for the solicitation in the preliminary proxy statement is set out below:
Tang Capital has engaged in discussions with the Company and the Board with regards to the strategic direction of the Company.  We believe that in order to maximize value for all stockholders, the Company must cease operations immediately, liquidate the Company’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Company’s stockholders.
Since the Company continues to operate as of the date of this Proxy Statement and has not publicly announced any plan of liquidation and dissolution, we believe the Board has rejected our proposal to immediately cease all operations, liquidate the Company’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Company’s stockholders.  In light of the foregoing, and in order to preserve and maximize the diminishing value of the Company’s assets for the benefit of all stockholders, Tang Capital has nominated Kevin C. Tang and Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D. for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting and proposed a stockholder resolution to be voted on at the Annual Meeting whereby the stockholders will request that the Company cease operations immediately, liquidate the Company’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Company’s stockholders.
On February 13, 2009, Tang Capital delivered a letter (the “Letter”) to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Company recommending Mr. Tang and Dr. Levin as nominees for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. On the same date, Tang Capital also delivered a notice (the “Notice”) to the Company of its intention to, among other things, nominate Mr. Tang and Dr. Levin for election to the Board and propose the stockholder resolution described herein.
Since delivery of the Letter and Notice, the Board has failed to engage with Tang Capital in a dialogue on the merits of its recommendations. Tang Capital therefore decided to embark on this solicitation of proxies to elect the Nominees and approve the resolution described herein.  See the information under the heading “Proposal 1 – Election of Directors” beginning on page • for additional information about the Nominees.  Further, Tang Capital believes that the proposed resolution is the best way for the stockholders to let the Board know what the stockholders consider to be the best direction for the future of the Company in a manner that is quantitative, clear and indisputable.

Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA)

					Posted in Activist Investors, Net Cash Stocks, Stocks, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA), tagged Activist investment, Liquidating Value, Net Cash Stock, Tang Capital Partners, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:VNDA) on March 12, 2009|

Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VNDA) is trading below its net cash value and an investor, Tang Capital Partners (TCP), has called for the company to “cease operations immediately, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Stockholders.” At the company’s $0.78 closing price yesterday, VNDA has a market capitalization of $20.8M. We estimate the net cash value to be more than 100% higher at $42.6M or $1.60 per share. The company is hemorrhaging cash, so the investment turns on TCP’s ability to get control and staunch the bleeding. We think they’re a fair bet, so we’ve added VNDA to the Greenbackd Portfolio.
About VNDA
VNDA is “is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics, with exclusive worldwide commercial rights to two product candidates in clinical development for various central nervous system disorders.” The company’s investor relations website is here.
The value proposition
VNDA is rapidly burning through its cash. It consumed $7.5M in the December quarter, which brings its cash burn for the twelve months to December 31, 2008 to $46M (that’s right, forty-six million dollars). Its cash burn predominantly consists of salaries and related costs for R&D personnel of $3.8M and  $4.8M in G&A expenses. The company has a substantial holding of cash and equivalents (the “Book Value” column shows the assets as they are carried in the financial statements, and the “Liquidating Value” column shows our estimate of the value of the assets in a liquidation):
We estimate the net cash value to be $42.6M or $1.60 per share. If VNDA burns through the same amount of cash in this quarter as the last quarter, this number will be reduced by $7.5M to $35.4M or $1.33 per share.
Off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
According to the company’s most recent 10Q (for the September quarter), it has no off-balance sheet arrangements. The contractual obligations as at December 31, 2008 totaled $5.8M and represents operating lease payments for the company’s headquarters through to 2016.
The company also has the following amounts due:
Consulting fees
We have engaged a regulatory consultant to assist us in our efforts to obtain FDA approval of the iloperidone NDA. We have committed to initial consulting expenses in the aggregate amount of $2.0 million pursuant to this engagement, $122,000 of which was expensed in the third quarter of 2008, and the remainder of which will be expensed in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we may retain the services of the consultant on a monthly basis from and after January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. In the event that the iloperidone NDA is approved by the FDA, we will be obligated to pay the consultant a success fee of $6.0 million, which amount will be offset by the aggregate amount of all monthly retainer fees previously paid to the consultant (Success Fee). In addition to these fees, we are obligated to reimburse the consultant for its ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred in connection with its engagement. We may terminate the engagement at any time; however, we will remain obligated to pay any remaining Success Fee if the iloperidone NDA is approved by the FDA following such termination.
Clinical research organization contracts and other contracts
We have entered into agreements with clinical research organizations responsible for conducting and monitoring our clinical trials for iloperidone and tasimelteon, and have also entered into agreements with clinical supply manufacturing organizations and other outside contractors who will be responsible for additional services supporting our commercial activities and our ongoing clinical development processes. These contractual obligations are not reflected in the table above because we may terminate them on no more than 60 days notice without incurring additional charges (other than charges for work completed but not paid for through the effective date of termination and other costs incurred by our contractors in closing out work in progress as of the effective date of termination).
License agreements
In February 2004 and June 2004, we entered into separate licensing agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Novartis, respectively, for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize our two compounds in clinical development. We are obligated to make payments under the conditions in the agreements upon the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. If the products are successfully commercialized we will be required to pay certain royalties based on net sales for each of the licensed products. Please see the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included with this report for a more detailed description of these license agreements.
As a result of the successful commencement of the Phase III clinical study of tasimelteon in March 2006, we met the first milestone specified in our licensing agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and made an associated milestone payment of $1.0 million. During March 2007, we met our first milestone under the license agreement with Novartis for VSF-173 relating to the initiation of the Phase II clinical trial and made an associated milestone payment of $1.0 million. On November 3, 2008, we received written notice from Novartis that this license agreement had terminated in accordance with its terms as a result of our failure to satisfy a specific development milestone within the time period specified in the license agreement. Please see Item 5 “Other Information” of Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a more detailed description of the termination of this license agreement. In November 2007, the Company met a milestone under the license agreement with Novartis for iloperidone relating to the acceptance of the NDA for iloperidone in schizophrenia and made a license payment of $5.0 million to Novartis. No other amounts were recorded as liabilities nor were any other contractual obligations relating to the license agreements included in the condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2008, since the amounts, timing and likelihood of these payments are unknown and will depend on the successful outcome of future clinical trials, regulatory filings, favorable FDA regulatory approvals, growth in product sales and other factors. For a more detailed description of the risks associated with the outcome of such clinical trials, regulatory filings, FDA approvals and product sales, please see the section “Risk Factors” of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
The catalyst
TCP disclosed its intial 21.1% holding in VNDA in a 13D notice dated October 6, 2008. The amended 13D notice dated November 17, 2008 disclosed a smaller 14.3% holding, which might suggest that TCP had reduced its holding. This was not the case. In fact, TCP was a purchaser throughout the relevant period. Unfortunately for TCP, some of its VNDA holdings were held in an account at Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (from the amended 13D notice):
On September 15, 2008 LBIE [Lehman Brothers International (Europe)] was placed into administration under United Kingdom law and four partners of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as joint administrators (the “Joint Administrators”). The Joint Administrators have advised us that most of TCP’s shares were rehypothecated. The Joint Administrators and UK counsel have further advised that LBIE’s customers will not be able to recover rehypothecated shares, but instead will be entitled to a general unsecured claim with respect to such shares. Accordingly, TCP in this filing has reduced the number of shares of [VNDA] held by TCP to the extent such shares were held at LBIE. By making this filing, TCP does not waive any argument that it is entitled to recover such shares and expressly reserves such arguments.
Since the date of the last filing on Schedule 13D, on November 7, 2008, Tang Capital Partners, LP purchased 560,000 shares of Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s common stock through the open market for $0.8291 per share.
(If you’re interested, you can read more about “rehypothecation” here.) In a further amended 13D notice dated February 18, 2009, TCP disclosed an increased 14.9% holding and discussed its nomination of two candidates to the board VNDA:
Since the date of the last filing on Schedule 13D, Kevin C. Tang has continued to have discussions with [VNDA] and its Board of Directors in regards to the strategic direction of [VNDA].  Mr. Tang has expressed his opinion and proposed to [VNDA] and its Board of Directors that in order to maximize value for all Stockholders, [VNDA] must cease operations immediately, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the Stockholders.
Since [VNDA] continues to operate as of the date of this filing and has not publicly announced any plan of liquidation and dissolution, the Reporting Persons believe [VNDA]’s Board of Directors has rejected their proposal to immediately cease all operations, liquidate [VNDA]’s assets and distribute all remaining capital to the stockholders.  In light of the foregoing, and in order to preserve and maximize the diminishing value of [VNDA]’s assets for the benefit of all Stockholders, the Reporting Persons determined to nominate certain individuals to be elected to [VNDA]’s Board of Directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and propose certain resolutions to [VNDA]’s Stockholders, as discussed in more detail below.
On February 13, 2009, Tang Capital Partners, LP delivered a letter (the “Letter”) to the Nominating and Governance Committee of [VNDA] recommending the following individuals (the “Nominees”) as nominees for election to [VNDA]’s Board of Directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders:
Kevin C. Tang
Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D.
On the same date, Tang Capital Partners, LP also delivered a notice (the “Notice”) to [VNDA] of its intention to take the following actions at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or any other meetings of stockholders held in lieu thereof, and any adjournments, postponements, reschedulings or continuations thereof:
(1) nominate the Nominees as candidates for election to [VNDA]’s Board of Directors;
(2) propose resolutions of the stockholders of [VNDA] to amend the Bylaws to (i) provide that [VNDA]’s Annual Meetings of Stockholders for each year commencing in 2010 be held on April 30th or, if April 30th is not a business day, on the first business day following April 30th and (ii) provide that certain matters requiring the approval of [VNDA]’s Board of Directors require a unanimous vote for such approval; and
(3) propose resolutions of the stockholders of [VNDA] to request that the Board of Directors promptly take all necessary action to swiftly and orderly liquidate [VNDA]’s remaining assets and return all remaining capital to [VNDA]’s stockholders.
A copy of TCP’s letter nominating Messrs Tang and Levin to the board is set out below:

Re: Recommendations for Candidates for Election as Directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the “Company”)
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Tang Capital Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“TCP” or the “Investor”), and its affiliates collectively control 3,965,852 shares of Common Stock and have beneficially owned 5% or more of the Common Stock, based on the number of shares reported outstanding by the Company in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, for at least four months.  Please refer to Exhibit A, attached hereto, for information regarding the Investor’s holdings.
The Investor believes that it would serve the best interests of the Company and its stockholders for the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Company (the “Committee”) to nominate the following two candidates (each a “Candidate” and together the “Candidates”) to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company (the “2009 Annual Meeting”):
1.  Kevin C. Tang
2.  Andrew D. Levin, M.D., Ph.D.
Biographical and background materials relating to each Candidate are set forth in Exhibits B and C attached hereto.  In addition, the Candidates are prepared to complete any D&O questionnaire reasonably requested by the Company in connection with their nomination as directors.
Pursuant to the guidelines outlined in the Company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Investors are hereby submitting these two candidates to the Committee for review and consideration.  Both Candidates meet the criteria and attributes said to be considerations of the Company’s Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee as described in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including:
· ability to read and understand basic financial statements;
·  general understanding of the Company’s industry;
·  relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management;
·  ability and sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the Company;
·  excellence in his field;
·  ability to exercise sound business judgment;
·  commitment to vigorously represent the long-term interests of the Company’s stockholders; and
·  an absence of factors that would preclude the Board from making a determination that the candidates are independent directors as defined in Rule 4200(a)(15) of the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.
In addition, we believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of these Candidates, when considered as a group with the other directors of the Company, will provide a balance of knowledge, experience and capabilities that will allow the Board to fulfill its responsibilities.  Moreover, the affiliation of each of the Candidates with a holder of significant shares of the Company will align their interests with those of stockholders generally.

In a separate letter to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, the Investor is simultaneously submitting a Stockholder’s Notice of Nomination of Persons for Election as Directors and Other Proposed Business at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc., dated February 13, 2009 (the “Notice”).  If the Board determines to nominate either of the proposed Candidates, recommends his election and includes his name in the proxy card for the 2009 Annual Meeting, the Investor will not directly nominate such Candidate at the 2009 Annual Meeting.  If we do not hear from you by the close of business on February 28, 2009, we will pursue any and all courses of action that we determine to be appropriate for the election of our Nominees at the 2009 Annual Meeting.

Managing Director
VNDA responded by issuing the following press release:
VANDA PHARMACEUTICALS RESPONDS TO ANNOUNCEMENT AND FILING BY A GROUP LED BY TANG CAPITAL PARTNERS, LP
ROCKVILLE, MD. – February 23, 2009 – Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: VNDA) (“Vanda” or the “Company”) today issued the following statement regarding two letters sent to Vanda by Tang Capital Partners, LP (“TCP”) and a SEC filing by TCP stating its intent to, among other things, nominate two directors to stand for election at Vanda’s 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and submit proposals at the 2009 Annual Meeting to amend Vanda’s bylaws and request that the Board of Directors of Vanda take action to liquidate the Company.
In accordance with Delaware law and the Company’s bylaws, the Company’s Board of Directors is divided into three classes of approximately equal sizes. The members of each class are elected to serve a 3-year term with the term of office of each class ending in successive years. The two current directors of the Company whose terms expire at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders are its current Chief Executive Officer, Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, M.D. and its current Chairman of the Board, Argeris N. Karabelas, Ph.D. Dr. Polymeropoulos is a founder of Vanda and has served as President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Vanda since May of 2003. Dr. Karabelas has served as a Director and Chairman of the Board since 2003, when he co-founded Vanda with Dr. Polymeropoulos. The Company intends to nominate both of these individuals for reelection at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Vanda believes that its current Board of Directors has the independence, the knowledge and the commitment to successfully implement the Company’s business plan and to deliver value for the Company and its stockholders.
“The Board is disappointed that Tang Capital has opted to conduct an election contest, particularly when the Company is so close to receiving a response from the FDA regarding its lead compound, iloperidone. Instead of working with us to maximize stockholder value, Tang Capital has chosen to create unnecessary costs and distractions for the Company at this important time,” said Brian K. Halak, Ph.D., a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and Chairman of its Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. Vanda believes the best interests of its stockholders will be better served by re-electing Drs. Polymeropoulos and Karabelas, and by continuing to move forward with its current business plan. Vanda therefore intends to oppose TCP’s nominees and to work actively to re-elect Drs. Polymeropoulos and Karabelas.
Vanda carefully reviewed TCP’s proposals to amend its bylaws and determined that such amendments would not be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. Vanda believes that the proposed amendments requiring unanimous Board consent to approve certain transactions would, in the Company’s opinion, severely restrict the ability of the Company and its Board of Directors to conduct business. In addition, Vanda believes that the proposed amendment requiring the Company to hold its Annual Meeting on April 30 of each year would create unnecessary timing constraints and would not allow the Company enough time to prepare and file its annual proxy statement in a careful, thoughtful and thorough manner. Consequently, Vanda intends to oppose TCP’s proposal to amend the Company’s bylaws.
In addition, the Company does not believe that it is currently in the best interests of Vanda or its stockholders for the Company to “cease ongoing operations” and liquidate the Company, as has been suggested by TCP. Vanda’s Board of Directors and management regularly review all of the strategic options for managing the company to create the greatest value for its stockholders. Vanda’s Board of Directors and management team have been and remain intensely focused on acting in the best interest of the Company and creating value for all of its stockholders. In connection with this goal, Vanda’s management team has been working diligently over the past several months with the Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) to reevaluate its response to Vanda’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) for iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia. In September of 2008, management met with the FDA to discuss the FDA’s not-approvable letter relating to the NDA and submitted a complete response on November 6, 2008, at the request of the FDA. The FDA accepted the complete response for review and has set a new target action date of May 6, 2009. The Company believes that, even in the absence of an approval by the FDA for iloperidone, there remains significant unrealized value in the Company’s other compounds. Therefore, the Company does not believe that liquidation is currently in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders and intends to oppose TCP’s proposal to liquidate the Company.
TCP has previously criticized Vanda’s spending in general and specifically its spending since the receipt of the not-approvable letter from the FDA. However, Vanda has substantially reduced spending and dramatically reduced its employee headcount in the wake of the FDA letter. The Company has been working on a reduced budget and has curtailed all non-essential expenditures. Vanda believes that this approach will allow it to continue to minimize any reduction in stockholder value based on the Company’s cash assets while it awaits the FDA’s reply to its complete response. Unfortunately, due to the course of action taken by TCP, the Company will now need to expend significant unanticipated amounts in connection with its 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Moreover, under Delaware law, the Board of Directors is given the power to determine, in the first instance, whether the Company should be dissolved. The only exception to the clear statutory scheme involves unanimous approval of liquidation by all stockholders, which, given the Board’s perspective, is extremely unlikely. The Company’s Board of Directors has determined that it remains to be in the best interests of the Company to continue its operations.
Vanda has previously met with TCP to discuss its proposals and would be willing to meet with them again in the future.
Conclusion
VNDA is an interesting play. With its stock closing yesterday at $0.78, the company has a market capitalization of $20.8M. We estimate the net cash value to be around 100% higher at $42.6M or $1.60 per share. This value is of course deteriorating rapidly, and the challenge for investors is to determine which of two outcomes is more likely: If TCP can get on the board quickly, stop the cash burn and liquidate the company, we’re likely to see a reasonably good return. If TCP cannot get onto the board quickly or at all, the company will continue to burn cash and the investment will be a dud. VNDA has a staggered board, so this will make TCP’s task difficult. We’re inclined to take a position now and see how this plays out, although we’re going to keep a close eye on the proceedings.
VNDA closed yesterday at $0.78.
The S&P500 Index closed yesterday at 721.36.
