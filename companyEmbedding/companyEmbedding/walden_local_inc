happy birthday henry!


July 10, 2017










Birthday Boy



Henry David Thoreau is often associated with protecting untouched wilderness, preserving land in its ‘original’ or pre-human state.  But a closer look at Thoreau’s legacy today reveals an evolving and more complex view of the role of conservation in a world in which virtually none of the Earth’s surface has been impervious to heavy human influence.Thoreau inspired a generation – including John Muir, John F. Kennedy and Theodore Roosevelt – to protect land.  Not to lock up pieces of land to throw away the key, but to promote working landscapes, to be utilized to promote human interaction with nature.  Our National Parks and Forests systems, including the Cape Cod National Seashore to our East and the Green and White Mountain National Forests to our North are wonderful examples in our own backyards.  None of these places – although protected – remain untouched wilderness.  Instead they encourage a harmonious engagement of humans with their surroundings: actively managed working landscapes designed to protect and build healthy ecosystems.Thoreau is often cited as an inspiration for the creation of conservation and agricultural easements to preserve working agricultural landscapes.  “A town is saved, not more by the righteous men in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it,” a brochure of the California State Parks quotes Thoreau, explaining the genesis of that state’s easement programs.In Walden, Thoreau wrote extensively about the poor land management practices of his neighboring farmers in Concord, Mass – explaining that a lack of crop rotation and allowing cattle to graze in mixed woodlots lead to both poor quality pastures and poor quality woodlots.  Although much of his writing criticizes our tendency to destroy and overutilize natural resources, the answer was not for everyone to live alone in the woods.  Instead, the answer is found in better land management practices.  In agriculture, this is referred to as “regenerative agriculture” – practices like management intensive grazing, in which grass-fed cattle are rotated through successive pastures with high stocking densities to build and retain soil fertility, and in turn, drive higher productivity of perennial pastures. July 12 marks Henry David Thoreau’s 200th birthday.  Show your appreciation for preserving working landscapes by visiting a local farm, hiking in the Green or White Mountains, or even just sharing your favorite photograph of a landscape you love.









WHY GRASS-FED: UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE COSTS OF INDUSTRIAL MEAT


June 12, 2017



In 2013, Trucost released a report that monetized the value of the negative environmental externalities produced by the world’s largest business sectors. The results of the report were damning, especially for the industrial agriculture sector, and specifically for cattle ranching and farming businesses. Of more than 1,000 region-sectors analyzed, industrial cattle ranching and farming in South America had the second greatest overall environmental cost, totaling to nearly $355 billion. When compared to revenues of only $17 billion, it’s quite easy to see that if these businesses were forced to pay for their pollution, land degradation, and overall disruption of ecosystem services they would not only not be profitable, but they wouldn’t even be able to cover their capital costs!Cattle ranching operations in South America aren’t the only ones to blame, either. Cattle ranching in North America produced over $30 billion in negative land use externalities alone, and that doesn’t account for air or water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, or waste production! Because these operations do not have to pay for these costs, they are able to sell exceptionally cheap products while still turning a profit. That’s why you should be skeptical when you see ground beef advertised for $3.99/lb. That price certainly does not take into account the billions in environmental externalities produced during the lifecycle of the product, and it certainly doesn’t even leave enough wiggle room to pay the farmer a living wage, but that’s a discussion for another day.At Walden, we only work with partner farms who are stewards of the land and are committed to raising animals the right way. This doesn't mean that they produce limited negative externalities - it means that they produce positive externalities through the implementation of 100% grass-fed pasture systems, practices that regenerate soil health & fertility and support functional working landscapes that sequester carbon and support perennial pasture growth. As we’ve written about extensively in prior blog posts, raising animals in a sustainable, regenerative manner can in fact leave our land, air, and ecosystems in a better state than if they were left untouched by increasing carbon sequestration, decreasing methane production, and improving overall ecosystem health by restoring natural ecosystem services.

Moving Forward


June  2, 2017



As a connector or rural and urban communities, we generally try to avoid politics. When it comes to the Paris Agreement, we can’t be silent—as it is so tied to the principles that led us to Walden and guide our actions day to day.The Paris Agreement was a landmark step in climate action and a global symbol of good faith. It is incredible that so much of the world came together to agree on anything, let alone a topic as critical and contentious as climate change. Yet, it is important to understand that it was a voluntary agreement, not a binding law; individual countries created emissions targets and pledged to try their best to get there. There is no real enforcing or accountability beyond the eyes and opinions of the rest of the world. As such, we think our withdrawal from the Agreement indicates short-sightedness. With this decision, the US joins Nicaragua and Syria, the only two other nations which have not joined the Agreement.We can learn from our new trio. Nicaragua believes that the Agreement is not aggressive enough—allowing countries to set their own targets and not holding the biggest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters to a strict enough standard. As the single largest contributor to GHGs over the past century, the US has a unique challenge to right our role in climate change and lead by example.Exiting the Agreement represents an archaic perception of power. We are demanding attention by being the biggest bully on the world playground instead of earning respect by acknowledging our responsibility. Leaving the Agreement tarnishes the good-faith on which it was built and isolates us from the rest of the world that chooses to consider the future. The debate on the validity of climate change is over, and we have more than enough proof that environmentally-minded decisions are critical to current and future economies, public health, and peace.Fortunately, we don’t have to stop moving forward because of this symbolic step backward. In yesterday’s statement, Barack Obama reiterated the “bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher” in the crafting of the Paris Agreement. It is up to towns, cities, and states—along with private companies—to take the lead in the absence of federal leadership.As we often write here, agriculture is the single largest contributor to carbon emissions behind energy, with livestock representing the lion’s share of the sector's impact. We raise animals on grass, sequester carbon, and contribute to a net positive carbon footprint…and we look forward to doing our part!

How do we make it work? 


May  8, 2017



We are often asked how we manage to facilitate relationships with so many farmers, while ensuring that we have the right amount of product at the right time without compromising on any of our standards.First, when we were first getting started we wanted to develop real and lasting farm partnerships.  Many restaurants go out to farmers looking to order several hundred pounds of sirloin steaks on a monthly basis, and are even willing to pay a high price and make a big commitment.  But farmers that are experts at growing perennial pastures generally don’t also have inventory management, logistics, and customer service as a primary area of interest or expertise – making this type of order a red herring of sorts…one that creates lots of intractable problems for the farmer:  What to do with all of the shanks?  Ground beef?  How to deliver the product and ensure it stays cold?Instead, we make commitments for whole animals months in advance – and make good on those commitments even when our needs change.  We generally don’t work to change hearts and minds of farmers – we find producers who were already operating in ways consistent with our values and affidavit standards and help them to grow their operations.  This makes farm visits and ongoing monitoring pretty straightforward – we’re all after the same goals.Second, Kristen Kilfoyle, our talented Supply Chain Director, is a former intern of Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm, which is on the leading edge of pasture-based programs in the US.  Kristen works with our farms to share best practices, monitor performance, and ensure the integrity of our products.  Based in New Hampshire, she visits our partner farms on a monthly basis and each of our processors weekly.Lastly, our model works because of our amazing membership base.  The predictability of our share program (combined with some solid forecasting!) allow us to project out demand on a rolling 6-month basis and then coordinate what we anticipate our needs to be with our farms and processors.  Our hope is that by connecting communities – our member base to our farm partners – we can create a more stable system of planning and pricing that promotes the long-term viability and financial sustainability of our farms.









We are a Certified B Corporation!


April  7, 2017



We are thrilled to announce we are now a Certified B Corporation®!







This is a tremendous step forward for our company, as certification involves passing a series of rigorous tests to demonstrate companies meet higher standards of social and environmental impact, transparency, and accountability—much like Fair Trade or LEED certification. However, this distinction is not just for a bag of coffee or building, it applies to every decision we make as a business!Ultimately, the designation is intended to legally protect our mission and our values, and align us all around the idea that we will sometimes make decisions that do not provide short term profits, but serve our mission of supporting and growing local agriculture. Unlike traditional corporations, Certified B Corporations are required (and happy!) to consider the impact of their decisions not only on their shareholders’ short term profit, but also on their workers, suppliers, community, consumers, environment, and other stakeholders. Putting our community first has always been a pillar of our company and becoming certified has been a wonderful opportunity to solidify our mission. Our view is that our mission aligns nicely with our long term business interests, and the two do complement rather than compete with one another.We are honored to join companies such as Patagonia, Seventh Generation, and more, which we have admired for their socially minded decisions.Although we’re usually pretty skeptical about certifications and terms (especially when it comes to food), we are thrilled to officially join the common goal of Certified B Corps to redefine success in business to mean more than just profits.









Milk and Honey Ribs


April  4, 2017











When we first began testing and collecting recipes, we stumbled upon a phenomenal method for milk and honey baby back ribs. It may seem odd to cook with milk when most recipes call for glazes, sauces, or rubs. Yet, milk acts as a perfect buffer—heating the meat gently while basting it with cream. As the milk evaporates, the resulting ribs are impressively tender with a light brown toasted crust!This recipe has become a notorious favorite at Walden. Especially in these intermediate weeks of spring where it may be too cold to grill and too warm for stew. To maintain the delicate flavors, we recommend sticking to the oven as originally imagined by Cesare Giaccone of Osteria dei Cacciatori. We urge you to give his recipe a try! Milk and Honey RibsFor more info on the versatility of ribs, see HEREAs always, let us know how it goes! If you ever have a favorite recipe of your own, feel free to submit it to info@waldenlocalmeat.com for a chance to publish in our monthly card!













Tri-State Weather







It's Wine O' Clock.


March 14, 2017



Hey New England! If you’re riding out the snow day like we are, chances are you’re at home with a generous glass of wine and some food warming up the kitchen. It’s no secret that wine and meat are two peas in a pod, but often times we don’t give these two equal attention.In a recent piece, Eric Asimov reminds us that wine is food. Just like cereals or steaks, there are industrial, chemical-laden wines churned out of factories and local, carefully crafted varieties. Many “big box” wines have their flavors due to focus group reviews rather than ancestral family values. Treating wine as a food lets us consider it as an equal player on the table when it comes to sourcing and enjoying.It’s remarkable how many issues echo across the meat and wine industry—from costly label certifications to less-than-transparent production. Chemicals and additives in wine are normalized and hidden much the same way we find antibiotics and hormones in meat. The term “organic” has a tenuous foothold in meat, where it still allows animals to live in confinement and eat organic corn. In wine, organic requires the use of organic grapes and yeast with “no added sulphur dioxide, a preservative that is used in all but the most natural of wines.”Yet, a lot of factory wines use organic grapes and chemical additives. On the other hand, many small producers make wines that surpass organic standards but lack the finances to buy the certification. In meat, we have seen examples of both, though Walden prides itself on buying exclusively from farmers of the latter category.As with any other food, trusting your source is essential to getting a product you can feel good about. We hope you enjoy your snow day and make sure to eat (and drink!) well.Eric Asimov is the New York Times wine critic. If you’re looking for a pairing, he recommends “steaks and other rich, fatty meats can take bigger, more tannic reds, while burgers might be better with juicier reds. But it’s hard to go wrong, unless the wine is simply not very good. Would a white go with a red meat? Believe it or not, a big, dry riesling, or sometimes even a sweet auslese, can be just the thing. But I would try this only if you are feeling comfortably experimental.”Read more on the importance of sourcing your wine here













Oregon Trail video game, circa 1971







Walden's First (and only?) Product Endorsement


February 26, 2017



We grew up in the era of the Oregon Trail video game on the Apple IIC (for nostalgia purposes, you can play the original version online here and it's just as awesome as we remember it!).  Since then, video games have indeed become considerably better graphically.  Unfortunately they can also represent the worst of our society: violence, crime, profanity, and frankly laziness.  Nothing against Grand Theft Auto, but I don't think any parents are arguing that this video game makes us better people. Enter "Walden: A Game."  Although we highly advise an in person visit to Walden, for those who cannot get there, there is now a video game that we can wholeheartedly endorse.  While we can't comment on the level of fun relative to GTA until we have the opportunity to play it, it's a serious departure from most video games, and it's a wonderful way for children to explore Emerson and Thoreau's writings and the wonder of the woods just around the corner from us. Learn more about the game and watch a preview from the NYTimes. 


















WHY LOCAL PART III: EARN 3x YOUR MONEY!


February  5, 2017



We have written extensively here and elsewhere about why we think building a local food community matters (see here and here).  Buying local is a way of reconnecting communities, especially following our divisive elections.  Many of our farmers feel as though America is moving towards the dystopian society depicted in the Hunger Games series: the impoverished rural "sectors" toil to produce raw materials that fuel the elite urban sectors.  We think this needs to change; there is no shared understanding or community when we are disconnected from where our food comes from.  We are working on ways to solve the local food challenge by fostering connections and learnings across our farmer base and our member base, as a mechanism to address this divide.Beyond the greater societal benefit, even if you are a pure capitalist and care not for 'societal benefit' or anything of the sort - we still think you have a reason to purchase locally: pure dollars and cents in your pocket.  Every dollar spent has a multiplier; that is, when you spend $1 it has a direct benefit of additional spending, again and again.  $1 spent at a local coffee shop turns into a few cents to purchase supplies from a local distributor, a few cents in wages to a working mother who buys groceries with her earnings, a few cents for an owner to invest in another coffee shop.A 2013 Canadian study found that for every $100 spent at a local retailer, $52 stay within the local community.  That same figure for a local restaurant?  $79!  If you spent that same $100 at a chain retailer or chain restaurant, just $14 and $30, respectively would stay in the community.  That should matter to you as an individual, because dollars staying in a community support lower prices and higher wages for you.  But it should matter to you as a participant in a democratic society too, because local spending combats the perception of a continued transfer of wealth from rural to urban America.  More meaningfully, it reconnects us with our neighbors in support of a mutually beneficial goal: leaving behind a better community for our children than the one into which we were born.  


















The Feedlot: A Bovine Bender


December  9, 2016



Like a wound being healed, when landscapes are “reclaimed by nature” they are seen by some as returning to a purer state. Even the bucolic pastures and rolling hills we picture with grazing cattle are assumed to be worse than letting the “wild” be wild. We get caught up arguing that using land for grass-feeding is the lesser of two evils when, in fact, making responsible use of pasture is better than leaving it alone. This use is a net positive for the climate, land, animals, and farmers—not to mention your health!







All ranchers, both corn and grass-fed, do some level of rotational grazing. But Regenerative Livestock Management (RLM) strives to balance the scale of sustainability by finding the best middle ground between leaving land untouched and overgrazed. At its core, RLM is a “back to basics” move that mimics the natural movements of animals in the wild. In practice, RLM is a bit more scientific, grazing a high density herd on land for a short time—requiring ranchers to adjust herd size and grazing times depending on the dynamic local rainfall, soil, grasses, animal behavior, temperature, and more.WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PLANTSWhy don’t we just let the animals graze a large paddock on their own like they do out West? Short-term, high intensity grazing may seem like it’s over complicating a natural process. However, good pastures have a diverse mix of grasses with different tastes, textures, and nutritional content. If you were given a buffet to pick from for a week, it’s safe to say that the dessert section would probably be decimated while the steamed spinach would be only lightly touched. This holds true for cows too. Left to their own devices they will gravitate towards their favorite grasses—munching them down to the roots and moving on. Curbing this urge is an important part of letting productive pastures flourish.







Similarly, in many forests, prairies, and even agricultural fields, controlled burning is used to rejuvenate soil minerals and stimulate growth of diverse plant species. Without fire, groups of species known as “climax communities” outcompete all other plants until the landscape becomes dominated by just a few types of species. Fire keeps these environments in check and lets new plants grow and enrich the ecosystem. Like fire, a large group of cows moved frequently across smaller pastures will eat grasses more or less evenly. When done well, this mows the pasture down to 2-3.5 inches where it can easily regrow. Keeping pastures dynamic ultimately produces more forage and carbon sequestration than pastures that are mechanically harvested, grazed long-term, or left alone. Over the course of five years, this was tested on 110,000 acres and found to double productivity per acre.WHAT THIS MEANS FOR LAND







Compared to other classes of food, industrial meat is a two-step process: grow corn, feed it to cows. As a result, it takes far more energy input to produce meat than grain. Many advocates of vegetarian or vegan diets use this as a point against meat production and as evidence that we could feed more people by eliminating meat from our diets. Yet, cows, sheep, and other ruminants are naturally designed to turn indigestible grasslands into edible animal protein.We have a vast resource of unusable grassland in the US—614 million acres unsuitable for any other type of agriculture. Yet, in 2015, we diverted up to a third of all feed grains (corn, grain, oats, etc) produced in the US to feed animals. Grass-fed cows are a win-win, using underutilized land while freeing up colossal amounts of grain for human consumption.WHAT THIS MEANS FOR AIRWhen we think of greenhouse gases, the primary metric of interest is CO2 emissions. Fortunately cattle production is not a large emitter of carbon—paling in comparison to the vehicles/equipment used for clear-cutting new agricultural farmland. In fact, by promoting plant growth and fertilizing land, cows actually do a notable job of lowering CO2 by promoting carbon sequestration in grasslands. The lifetime value of grazing beef on grass actually comes out to 7.8 kg of CO2 equivalent stored per kg of weight. For every kg the cow gains, 7.8 kg of carbon are removed from the atmosphere.The elephant in the room is methane. Methane is much more potent than CO2—warming the atmosphere up to 34 times more than CO2. However, it is much shorter lived, leaving the atmosphere after a decade or so. When digesting food, cows burp and fart methane (…humans do too!). A popular critique of grass-feeding cows relies on the longer lifespan of these cattle. Without grain, antibiotics, hormones, and other substances to promote speedy growth, grass-fed cows graze for an average of 130 more days and yield 30% less weight. By living longer, critics say, they release more methane, simple as that.This oversimplified argument misses what grass-feeding contributes to the environment and ignores the fact that huge methane emissions come from liquefied manure storage lagoons found at feedlots. The large concentration of animals in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) makes manure into an overabundant, never-ending waste problem. In grass-feeding, manure is stomped into the ground and used for what it was meant for, fertilizer. Manure thus becomes a tool for plant growth, healthy topsoil, and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria—sequestering greenhouse gases instead of releasing them.WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ANIMALSUnfortunately, when comparing grass and grain-feeding, all of these other factors tend to come before the health and quality of the animal. It may be a cliché, but when it comes to beef, “you are what you eat” does hold true. RLM pastures are a mosaic of different plants all offering their own nutrients uniquely suited to the digestive systems of cows. When cattle eat corn or other grains, their stomach microbes ferment the starch. This fermentation, especially in large quantities, leads to serious “acidosis” health problems from stomach bloat to even death. These symptoms are akin to forcing someone gluten free or celiac to eat nothing but gluten.We’ve seen grain-feeding called a “luxury” for cows. If you’re a kid, running rampant through a candy store could be considered a “luxury”. If you’re a rock star, getting plastered on drugs and alcohol could be a “luxury”...At the end of this bovine bender you’re left with a fatty steak depleted of nutrients.Raising cows on unnatural diets promises a slew of health problems. As a result, many of these animals are given sub-theraputic doses of antimicrobials to curb sickness. When this was measured in 2007, it was found that 12.6 million kg of antimicrobials were administered to livestock in the US each year. That’s 80% of all antibiotics used in the US—with 61% of those deemed “medically important” for human medical therapy by the FDA. This is a big deal when unnecessary use creates antibiotic resistant pathogens, rendering these drugs less effective when humans need them to fight off infections. RLM AND CORNIt makes sense that proponents of grain-feeding spend a lot of time thinking about what an animal takes. The grain-feeding system takes a toll on feed, water, antibiotics, hormones, and ultimate environmental quality without the return found in RLM grazing. The argument is that these established methods are more efficient, saving space and time, two less tangible but critical resources. Yet, doing something efficiently but unsustainably will deplete resources before we’ve learned to cherish them.Grain-feeding and non-RLM pasture operations break a successful natural cycle. Feedlots have a land fertility, feed, and waste problem. Instead of the cows naturally fertilizing their feed in the pasture, the corn, soy and grain they consume in a feedlot setting requires vast amounts of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides to grow. This feed has to be trucked in from miles away. The feed is unnatural to the cows body, thus the animals need to be supported with antibiotics and hormones in confined spaces. Cramming the animals together leads to a decline in usable land and healthy soil, and an unwieldy amount of manure. Finally, this leaves an environmentally harmful wake behind that harms not only the land but also the atmosphere. Antibiotics, manure lagoons, and methane capture are efforts to mitigate problems that the industry created for itself.RLM can make beef production not just net zero but a net positive to climate change by closing the cycle. When it comes to sequestration, claims that take a stab at a life-cycle analysis of beef found that if you used restorative pasture raising on the world’s grasslands you could sequester more carbon than has been emitted since the industrial revolution. So far RLM has been adopted by advocates in 40 million acres around the world. The amount of grass-fed beef sold retail has increased steadily since 2011, but still accounts for than 1% of total sales by weight.Fortunately, we’re not alone in championing RLM, many leading advocates such as the Nature Conservancy, NRDC, and more insist on the importance of RLM. But more research needs to be done—especially when it comes to projecting and modeling life-cycle analyses. We are proud to practice these methods on our partner farms and advocate for what is a truly sustainable option!Read more at Savory Institute, Nature Conservancy, NRDC, and morehttp://www.jswconline.org/content/71/2/156.refshttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X15300032http://www.planet-tech.com/sites/default/files/Upside%20(Drawdown)%20-%20A%20New%20Narrative%20on%20Grassland%20Carbon%20Capture%20-%20Itzkan%202014%20-%20V0.9.6.pdfhttp://savory.global/assets/docs/evidence-papers/Scientific-Portfolio-2016.pdfhttps://www.nrdc.org/issues/livestock-production#priority-what-we-dohttp://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/southamerica/argentina/howwework/sustainable-grazing-1.xmlhttps://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/fds16j/fds-16j.pdfhttp://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/newsletter/pub__5621800.htmlhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeeActADUFA/UCM231851.pdfhttps://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/land-and-natural-resources/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/









The Joy of Cooking a Pasture-Raised Bird


November 22, 2016



The difference between a Thanksgiving turkey raised outdoors on pasture and one raised inside in confinement is significant. As a result of getting exercise to forage for part of their diet and consuming green grass, turkeys raised on pasture tend to have smaller breasts and rich, flavorful dark meat.  Nutritionally, as a result of eating so much grass, these turkeys have been shown to have significantly more Vitamin E, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, and a higher Omega-3 to Omega-6 ratio.  It’s also worth noting that they don’t contain Arsenic - many industrial scale producers commonly add Arsenic to poultry feed (it is permitted by the USDA at 0.5ppm or less), which in small amounts improves growth rates… but it also happens to be a toxin and the primary ingredient in most rat poisons!).So what to do with your pasture-raised bird?  We suggest a dry brine (start today if you’re cooking Thursday!).  We find that a typical “wet brine” can make the meat squishy and watery, whereas a dry brine concentrates flavors and makes for a crispy golden skin.Using about 1 tablespoon of salt per 4 lbs of bird, plus black pepper and your favorite fresh herbs (sage, rosemary and/or thyme work well), rub the bird all over, including underneath the skin as deep as possible above the breasts (be careful not to tear the skin!).  Place the bird on a open rack in your refrigerator, allowing water to drip off of the bird to a tray below.  Allow to rest for 24-48+ hours.Place a few onions and apples, cut in half, inside the bird’s cavity.  Heat oven to 450 and roast for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and cover breasts with foil.  Reduce temp to 350 degrees, and cook for several hours (general rule of thumb for a pasture-raised bird is 8-10 min per lb).  You should begin to check after about 2 hours – you’re looking for a temp range around 140-160, depending on your preferences (note that we are lower than the USDA’s recommended 180 degrees, so please do so at your own risk!).Beware: as a result of lower fat content and lower moisture from dry brining, we have found that pasture-raised birds tend to cook significantly faster than their industrial brethren.  There is nothing worse than choking down chalky, dry white meat and having to pull out the ketchup when the gravy runs out!  Remember, you can always return the bird to the oven if it’s underdone, if it’s overdone, well, you’re going to need to call Doc Brown for advice at that point.

In Memory of Mike Czerwinski


October 27, 2016



Earlier this week we lost a friend and colleague, Mike Czerwinski.Mike joined us just 7 weeks ago, but will leave a long-lasting positive impact on our company.  We have the same growing pains of many young companies: occasionally we get behind, people make mistakes, things get missed.  As a team, we’re often in a position of fixing eachothers’ mistakes, trying to catchup, filling in wherever necessary to get done whatever needs to be done.  In these situations, Mike is the guy you want next to you – never frustrated, never flustered, always positive and smiling.  We’d get behind, and Mike would just put his head down and grind it out.When I asked Mike if he could think of any weaknesses when we first interviewed him for the job, he suggested that he had always been pretty shy and quiet.  He was certainly right about this - it must have been a week before he spoke to anyone without being spoken to first!  But overtime we noticed that Mike exuded a quiet confidence - a clear strength rather than a weakness - leading us to put him in a leadership role on our operations team after just 2 weeks on the job.  He was not without his quirks - an annual tradition we are contemplating as a company is a shorts-in-the-negative 20 degree-walk-in-freezer-day, in honor of the guy who seemed to always shorts rain or shine, inside the freezer and out.Right as Mike coalesced into our culture and began to appear from under his shell we tragically lost him, just a few days after his 30th birthday.  Mike had a long life left to live, and a promising career to be had here at Walden.  We’ll miss him.

Massachusetts' Question 3


October 19, 2016



Let’s take a step away from the dumpster fire happening on the national presidential stage and turn our attention toward our local ballot measures. When it comes to day-to-day life here in Massachusetts, down-ballot elections and local ballot questions can make quite a difference. As advocates for local, responsible agriculture, we’ve spent a lot of time learning and talking about Question 3.Question 3 can be seen from two angles. On the farm side, Question 3 seeks to eliminate the confinement of veal calves, breeding pigs, and egg-laying chickens, which prohibits animals from moving and stretching freely. This is not too much to ask of Massachusetts agriculture, there is not a single farm utilizing gestation crates for pigs, and there is just one remaining farm raising laying hens in cages. On the consumer side, Question 3 will prohibit the sale of these cage-raised products in our local stores. This is a tricky line to walk, as removing the cheapest, most-industrial options from stores will likely lead to a bump in prices. Yet, Massachusetts is not a pioneer in this legislation, arguably we are a laggard, following in the footsteps of California, Michigan, Costco, McDonalds, and the general climate of the egg industry.  We believe cage free eggs will be the market standard in just a few short years. This is good to hear, as we feel that the cost of caged eggs is actually higher than it appears--with the negative externalities associated with this method of production being borne by all of us.  If passed, this legislation would not even come into full effect until 2022, Massachusetts will be transitioning in the same time span as national, affordable voices such as McDonalds, Denny’s, and many other companies. This industry-wide movement means larger changes, from more efficient designs for cage-free housing to affordable prices on better products.It’s important to re-emphasize that battery cages represent the cheapest, most-industrial option in egg production. There is a vast spectrum between industrial, caged production and pasture-raised eggs. In election debates, these nuances tend to be clustered into “good” and “bad”, “yes” and “no”. We equate “cage-free” with “good” merely because it is the less-bad option—a familiar idea this year in politics. In truth, “cage-free” merely means that the hens live in large industrial barns that house thousands of birds. It’s not great, but it’s a step up. By implementing Question 3, we are advocating a slight rise in the minimum standard.  The ability to turn around does not ensure a chicken can express its natural behaviors - dust bathing, scratching, preening, and hunting for bugs - but it is a starting point for an absolute minimum standard of animal welfare that we all should be able to agree on. It’s rare that Massachusetts residents get the chance to vote on the ethics and quality of their food. We will be voting yes on 3 on November 8th, and we hope you will too.Learn More!

Farm Fiction


September 14, 2016



When we see brand names with the words “farm”, “pasture”, “butcher”, or even “kitchen” we’re transported to a place. We imagine that food being prepared for us in the field or home. When brands include place names, this effect is magnified. In choosing the name Walden, we were eager to reflect Thoreau’s values of natural simplicity in our own company mission. On the other hand, Walden is also an icon of our home and a landmark of where we produce our meat—New England.Yet, a recent investigation revealed that a British supermarket chain was branding foreign products with seemingly local farm names. Produce such as spinach from as far as Senegal or Honduras was sold with the label “Redmere Farms”. When it came to meat, cuts from both the UK and across Europe were labeled with English names such as Woodside Farms or Boswell Farms. Although the origin of the products could be found in small print, the implications of these names served to mislead customers searching for local products. Whether your last name or a brand name, there is a lot of power in the terms we use to describe people and places. Changing your name from Romano to Jones can seemingly change your lineage from Italy to Ohio. Similarly, a steak from Negenharrie or Walden can imply a 4,000 mile difference between New England and Germany! This is especially critical for food, given the different value ascribed to various places of origin. For more on this story, see HERE and HERE

Is That Food Safe to Eat? Food Producers Get to Decide For Themselves


August 18, 2016



When it comes to food, Americans are lucky to worry about things like nutrition, taste, aesthetics…not necessarily safety. When we walk the grocery store aisles, we trust that what has been put before us is edible. Yet, the FDA has left a dangerous door open in its Final Rule on Substances Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS).Looking past the name—which inspires the same kind of confidence as, “that trampoline is generally recognized as safe” or “that dog is generally friendly”—this rule creates a massive conflict of interest. The GRAS ruling allows for food manufacturers to determine the safety of their own food additives. Thus, companies that create additives, use additives, or sell additives get to decide the worth of their own products. As pointed out in this article, these rules were drawn up in a time when GRAS substances referred to vinegar or vegetable oil, not complex chemicals. Nowadays, this invites a “shoot first, ask questions later” mentality that may work for some products, but not food.Checkout the full article here!









The Health and Environmental Benefits of Grass-fed Beef


August 11, 2016



This post is courtesy of Diana Rodgers, RD: registered dietitian, author, producer, and friend of Walden!







If you’re a fan of Walden, then you appreciate how properly raised meat tastes. Maybe films like “Cowspiracy” or the recent WHO statement on red meat and cancer concern you. As a “real food dietitian” living on one of the farms that supplies Walden, I’m going to explain how these are not issues with pasture-based herbivores. Americans are facing soaring rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer—partly because the food we’re eating isn’t giving us the nutrition we need. Our carbohydrate-heavy intake and reliance on highly processed, ultra-palatable, industrially produced food is making us sick, while at the same time leaving us malnourished. According to the CDC, the top US nutrition deficiencies are Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, Iron, Vitamin D, and Vitamin B6.Red meat is the most common bioavailable source of many of these nutrients. Even the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website lists beef as the #1 source for iron. It’s a more complete and absorbable form of protein compared to plant proteins. Beef is also a fantastic source of B12, a nutrient that vegans must supplement in order to stay healthy.I heard red meat causes cancer!The studies behind these claims are observational. They show a correlation between meat intake and cancer, but ONLY correlations. Not cause. These studies are relying on self-reported information from food frequency forms. Yet, many people lie or, at the very least, forget what they ate. It’s easy to remember things like “I ate red meat 3 times last week” but forget the sodas, chips, cake and cookies. Perhaps we “forget” how much we drink and smoke and inflate how much we exercise. Additionally, vegetarians tend to have a much healthier lifestyle overall compared to those eating a standard American diet. Comparing an “average omnivore” to a vegetarian without adjusting for other lifestyle factors like exercise, smoking, and fast food intake is called “Healthy User Bias” and has been studied here.In fact, this study looked at people who shop at health food stores (therefore attempting to adjust for lifestyle factors) and compare vegetarians to omnivores and found no difference in mortality.But we can sustainably engineer protein in labs…The argument that plant-based proteins engineered in labs is better for our health and the planet doesn’t hold much weight. I’ve already addressed the health reasons for eating meat above, so I’ll now address the sustainability argument.Alternative proteins like “tofurkey”, often seen as “sustainable” options engineered in labs, are ignoring the incredible amount of input required per calorie of protein. You can’t simply make protein out of thin air. Acres and acres of grains like soy, wheat and corn are required for this process, not to mention the amount of fossil fuels and water. These crops use incredible amounts of herbicides and pesticides, which not only require engineering of their own, but also degrade the land on which they are used.Let’s compare this to grass-fed beef from a local farm. The cows eat grass (free), yes they drink water, but they also produce manure (read: fertilizer), which improves the soil (bonus) to provide nutrient-dense, bio-available protein. If you were to do a complete life-cycle analysis on this process, and compare one pound of lab-produced protein to one pound of locally produced, holistically managed, grass-fed beef, the clear winner would be the beef. About the author: Diana Rodgers, RD is a “real food” registered dietitian living with her family on a working organic farm near Boston, Massachusetts.

Everyone Agrees To Reduce Antibiotics...Except These Guys


August  2, 2016



It's rare to see McDonald's or Perdue as examples of responsible production. While we're not in the business of praising the "lesser evil", Sanderson Farms' recent marketing gimmick has put these companies ahead of the curve.It's no secret that unclear food terms are often used as marketing tools. Taglines like "All natural", "fresh" (and now even "grass-fed") are largely unregulated, but are often used to mask conventional products.Yet, terms such as "no antibiotics" are clear and overwhelmingly seen as positive. Even companies like McDonald's and Perdue--typically the face of negative big ag--have made efforts to curtail antibiotic use. Unlike the other 4 of the top 5 American poultry producers, Sanderson Farms has doubled down their marketing to insist antibiotics are fine.Lampkin Butts, president of Sanderson, defended antibiotic use as critical to his version of sustainablility: "using less of everything". This is a grossly shallow definition, especially when applied to critical resources to life such as feed, water, shelter, and electricity.Sustainability means using more time and more space. It means doing things at a natural speed and accounting for waste. In farming, it means using the necessary amount of food and water to sustain life. If Sanderson Farms sees sustainability as meaning "less" then why not start with less antibiotics?Read the feature article here: Poultry Producer Sanderson Farms Stands Its Ground: It's Proud To Use Antibiotics

Where Do Our Candidates Stand On Food?


July 27, 2016



In the past few hours, weeks, and months, politics have dominated the media. Some candidates are doing things right, some wrong, some saying too little, others saying far too much. Yet, no one is talking about food.In the most basic sense, food is a critical resource--as essential as clean water. How we produce, consume, and trade it touches almost every issue on the table from environment to economy. In a campaign where all sides need to tap millennial support, this issue is a strong link to young voters that often hits close to home. Considering the recent repeal of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) and several other questionable policies that affect us individually, we should know where our candidates stand. Read HERE for an interesting piece by Kim Severson for the New York Times on food in today's political landscape.


















Why Is Our Chicken "Air Chilled"?


July  8, 2016



If you received Walden chicken, you will notice a new label, “Air chilled!”This may not seem noteworthy…isn’t that the standard? Not necessarily. An important element of chicken processing involves bringing the meat down to a refrigerated temperature as quickly as possible, to minimize any growth of harmful bacteria.  The most common cooling method in modern US poultry facilities utilizes a chlorinated bath.  If you've ever seen (or imagined) this process, it is quite messy. After just a few chickens the water is, well, frankly not something you'd enjoy for bathing.  The water becomes a vehicle for transmitting bacteria across birds and adds a substantial amount of water to the meat—up to 10% of the weight! This doesn’t just make the resulting chicken heavier (and pricier!), it also dilutes and changes the flavor of the meat.

A newer and alternative method of chilling uses air. Instead of using communal pools, the chickens are hung individually and moved through a series of refrigerated chambers blasting cold air.  The process is more expensive and less efficient than water baths - but it saves thousands of gallons of water. When it comes to taste and hygiene, we think it makes for a better chicken. Although this process is still a bit niche in the US, it has been common practice for decades in Europe. As we've always said, good things come to those who wait!  Instead of absorbing (chlorinated!) water, these chickens lose water weight, making for a denser, juicier and more flavorful meat, with a skin that more easily crisps in the cooking process.  In many ways, air chilled chicken is analogous to the dry aging process of beef.  Most beef in this country is "wet-aged": cut immediately after slaughter, vacuum-sealed, aged in wet bags, and then sold 10-15 days later.  The 2-week period spent in a refrigerated bag relaxes muscle fibers and releases some water, which makes for a tenderer product.  But it also creates an irony taste (which many Americans associate with the natural flavor of beef), and leaves you with a bag full of water after you remove the meat.  Industrial producers like it for this reason (water loss costs money!), and the process is highly efficient because the finished product is shipped quickly and doesn't require valuable storage space. The alternative, dry aging, requires a whole side of beef to remain uncut and unpackaged at a specific temperature and humidity.  The carcass can lose a significant amount of water weight (sometimes up to 10%), which concentrates natural flavors. The beef's natural enzymes also begin to break down the connective tissue in the muscle, leading to a significantly tenderer product.  This is especially important for grass-fed animals that can lack the fat content of cattle from a feedlot.  For both beef and chicken, these few extra steps make a big difference. We believe better methods produce better products – both on the farm and in the processing facility.For more info, see here

CHICKENS ARE BACK!!


June  8, 2016



It's that time of the year again...chicken season!Chicken is the most popular meat in the US--in fact, it recently surpassed beef for the first time in over 100 years.  Unfortunately, our chicken is only available seasonally...but we promise it's worth the wait!  And there is an important reason why it's not available in January.Walden chicken is pasture-raised—meaning the birds are raised outdoors in movable open air shelters (note that this is very different from the term "cage-free"). However, winter temperatures and snowfall (especially in New England!) mean barren land. Although hens can lay eggs in movable winter hoop houses, we want our broiling chickens to grow up with full access not just to soil, but also to living pasture. We let them develop at their natural pace—unlike several store brands that use antibiotics and other additives to encourage faster growth. Why do we care so much about the pasture? In short, pastured chickens are happier, healthier, and tastier. “Pastured” is the latest of several poultry terms striving to close loopholes to sustainable, humane farming. For example, the term “free-range” intended to allow chickens “access to the outdoors” and move away from factory farming. Yet, beneath these surface intentions are a plethora of loopholes left to be interpreted by the farmer. Many well-intentioned commercial scale operations use free-range in good conscience. Others slap a “chicken door” on the side of a 100 foot-long warehouse to allow chickens a few square feet of dirt.Pasture raising chickens has been shown to decrease bacteria content and increase Omega-3 fatty acids—specifically Eicosapentaenoic acid. These compounds are at the forefront of health supplements such as fish oils, and play an important role in regulating metabolism and lowering inflammation. And the chickens are eating them as a result of a more varied diet that contains forages grasses and insects. We believe this is the best method for all involved (the chickens, and you too) and it also happens to produce the tastiest chickens that are well worth the wait.For more on the science, see here or here.To try some of this elusive chicken, sign up for your own share!

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

frequently asked questionsWhen will my order be ready?  We deliver ONCE per month and your delivery date will be confirmed via email at the beginning of the month and then again 3-4 days prior (your delivery will generally be within 25-30 days of your previous delivery). We also have makeup days if you are not available on your regularly scheduled date, which you can select on your member page.  We deliver Sunday night through Friday. What do your customers think?  Some recent feedback we've received:"I really feel that you have given me the opportunity to live my values""I've been using Walden for almost a year now and it is a choice I've never regretted!  The service is amazing, the cuts are top notch and the variety really makes me think outside the box for new recipes.""Last night, I cooked my first steak (not just from your program, but EVER)... man! I think that's the best thing I've ever cooked.  I was so proud of myself and I never would have done it without you!  I think that your program is not just increasing access to humanely raised meat, it is also really teaching people how to cook meat!  A valuable skill!"If you'd like to read more reviews, check us out on Yelp!






MASSACHUSETTS, RHODE ISLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE DELIVERY AREA (click to enlarge!)



Where do you deliver?  We currently deliver free of charge to most areas in:Greater Boston, including the entire north shore and almost all areas inside of the Interstate 495 loop. Several areas of Rhode Island from Providence down to Bristol, Warwick, and up to Woonsocket.  Several towns in Fairfield County, Connecticut from Fairfield to Danbury.Areas of Westchester and Putnam County, New York. Coastal New Hampshire!If you are outside the delivery area, we are happy to deliver to a work or friend's address!Do I need a bigger freezer?  No - a 10lb order is about 1 cubic foot of space, which fits fine in any home refrigerator / freezer (assuming it's not already full with items that you can't identify, in which case it's maybe time for a clean start?).  You can also skip anytime if you run out of room.






NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT DELIVERY AREA (Click to enlarge!)



Sometimes we have a busy month, or we're traveling... is there a way to skip or delay a delivery?  What if it's too much meat?  No problem at all, just email us at info@waldenlocalmeat.com and we'll put your deliveries on hold while you're away.  You can restart at anytime without having to re-enter all of your information.  We also offer every other month, or ever 3rd month shares if this works better for your family! What will I get each month?  Can I customize my box or add to our share?  Each 6-7lb share generally comes with one pound of ground beef, 1 type of sausage and/or bacon, and the remaining 4lbs a mix of cuts that you specify in the order form (either roasts or steaks/chops/ribs).  Larger sizes are generally the same proportion of cuts (e.g. a 10-lb share starts with 2lbs of ground beef and a sausage, plus 8lbs of cuts you specify).  You can opt out of anything you do not like (beef/pork/chicken/lamb or specific items) or update your preferences anytime via our member site. We also have monthly specials on various items (like pastured eggs!), which we provide through a members-only survey prior to our deliveries each month. See here for a full product list!  What farms do you work with? We partner with about 75 different supplier partner farms in New England, from Maplewind Farm in Richmond, VT to Sugar River Farm in Newport, NH to Clifford Waters Farm in Athol, MA - all within 250 miles of us.  In the spirit of transparency, we print the town where the animal was raised and the name of the farmer on every cut label (excluding ground beef and sausages, which are made in larger batches, but from the same farms).  All of these farms accept visitors but generally ask that you schedule beforehand, which we're happy to facilitate.  We visit our partner farms regularly, and aim to develop long term productive and mutually beneficial partnerships based on our shared values.  If you are a farmer and want to join our growing partnership, see here.

Can I purchase a gift?  We can always accommodate gifts if the recipient is in our delivery area, but do ask for a commitment of 3-months or longer.  If this is something you're interested in, just email us at info@waldenlocalmeat.com. How much should I order?  Here is a rough guideline:







Is the meat fresh?  Our meat generally reaches our customers more quickly than a typical industrial producer's would – mostly because it is traveling a shorter distance.  What depletes the flavor of meat is not letting it age properly (in the case of beef), slowly freezing it or quickly de-frosting it (as in a microwave).  After dry aging, our beef is custom cut and flash frozen, transported in a below-zero degree freezer, and left for you packed with cold packs and/or dry ice. We believe this results in the best tasting meat possible. After I defrost the meat, how long can it stay in my refrigerator?  If the vacuum seal of the package is not broken, your meat has a shelf life in a refrigerator of more than 2 weeks.  Once you break the seal you should consume the meat in 3 days if ground, 5 days for cuts / sausages.  The best way to defrost is in a bowl of cold water, or in your refrigerator overnight; the worst way to defrost would be to use your microwave. Is it organic? Although all of our suppliers pledge not to use pesticides, herbicides or antibiotics of any kind, not all of our suppliers have pursued USDA organic certification because it is tremendously costly for small producers.  We have found that there are other, perhaps more important, indicators of quality and sustainability.  Most beef that is certified organic still comes from a cow raised in a feedlot, where it is fed corn or grain, which is completely unnatural for a grazing animal.  Although it's great that the corn is organic, any type of grain wreaks havoc on a cow's digestive system, and produces meat that is much less healthy: higher in saturated fat and the "bad-fat" Omega-6s.  We think our own standards are much tougher - we ask our suppliers to sign this affidavit for beef, this affidavit for pork, this affidavit for lamb, and this affidavit for poultry What if we aren't home when you deliver?  No problem!  Everything is packed with an ice pack in an insulated grocery bag, so it will stay cold for several hours on your doorstep.  If you do not have a safe drop spot for us to leave your delivery, we would suggest delivering to an office location.  Is it expensive? We believe meat that costs a few dollars per pound actually costs far more than that... in environmental destruction, the animal’s lack of wellbeing, and long-term human health. Our prices are honest, and offer great value relative to all-natural grocery stores.  Our Full Share includes items that would range from $8 to $35+/lb, and we try to provide a balanced delivery each month to ensure everyone receives some high value items.  We are also offering a very different product from what you see in a grocery store. Our animals are raised on pastures less than 250 miles from us, moved regularly, never fed antibiotics, and have plenty of space to enjoy their lives. They are raised by humans, not machines, on farms that are slowly rebuilding New England's agricultural heritage.  And you can taste the difference!   Why don’t you charge more? Our prices are a fair reflection of what it costs to produce the highest quality products.  Our goal is to make them available to as many people as possible while covering our costs, most of which goes towards supporting the small farms in New England that we're trying to bring back! When will I be billed?  With the exception of your first order, which is billed upon signup, we bill all of our accounts on or around the 1st of the month - this is in support of our mission, as it helps us pay our farm partners on time, and invest in New England's agricultural renaissance! Can I pre-pay my account for a discount?  We do offer this option for members through our monthly specials list - we encourage you to try a month first.  We offer discounts for 6-month and 12-month plans.  Are you hiring?  Yes!
