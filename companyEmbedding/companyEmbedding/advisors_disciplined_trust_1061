Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

INVESTMENT SUMMARY





INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The trust seeks to provide current interest income. There is no assurance the
trust will achieve its objective.



PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY



The trust seeks to provide an attractive level of current income by investing
in a portfolio consisting primarily of high yield corporate debt securities
(commonly known as "junk bonds").  The portfolio was selected by Hartford
Investment Management Company ("HIMCO").


To achieve its goal of providing an attractive level of income, HIMCO's "High
Yield Team" used a "bottom-up" analysis in order to determine which specific
issuers and securities it believes have the ability to support a high level of
sustainable yield on debt securities.  In this process, HIMCO assessed such
factors as an issuer's business environment, as well as its financial
statements, earnings and cash flow, asset coverage, the quality of its
management team and its capital structure.


As of the trust's inception date, the trust's portfolio includes only debt
securities of domestic and foreign issuers rated below investment grade
(securities rated "Ba" or lower by Moody's Investor Service, "BB" or lower by
Standard & Poor's or "BB" or lower by Fitch Ratings, or securities which, if
unrated, are determined by HIMCO to be of comparable quality).  Exposure to any
Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICS") industry was limited to 25% of
the value of the trust's portfolio as of the trust's inception.  As of the
trust's inception date, the trust's portfolio includes only bonds rated B- or
higher by Standard & Poor's or B3 or higher by Moody's Investor Service.
Certain bonds held by the trust may meet this criteria by only one credit rating
organization and to the extent that they are rated by both credit organizations,
the higher of the two ratings is applied.  These weightings, ratings and
classifications may vary thereafter.


High yield or "junk" bonds are frequently issued by corporations in the
growth stage of their development or by established companies that are highly
leveraged or whose operations or industries are depressed.  High yield bonds are
considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks,
and accordingly, the risk of non-payment or default is higher than with
investment-grade securities.  Because high yield bonds are perceived by
investors to be riskier than higher rated securities, their prices tend to
fluctuate more than higher rated securities and are affected by short-term
credit developments to a greater degree than investment-grade bonds.



PRINCIPAL RISKS



As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:


*  BOND PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over time.


*  THE VALUE OF THE BONDS WILL GENERALLY FALL IF INTEREST RATES, IN GENERAL,
RISE.  No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the
future.


*  A BOND ISSUER MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENT IN THE
FUTURE.


*  THE TRUST INVESTS IN SECURITIES RATED BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND ARE
CONSIDERED TO BE "JUNK" SECURITIES.  These securities are considered to be
speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks.
Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than investment grade
securities.  In addition, high yield bonds are often callable and may be
more likely to make early returns of principal.  Price, yield and the
trust's return may fluctuate more than in an investment in investment grade
securities.


*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.


2     Investment Summary





*  A BOND ISSUER MIGHT PREPAY OR "CALL" A BOND BEFORE ITS STATED MATURITY.  If
this happens, the trust will distribute the principal to you but future
interest distributions will fall.  A bond's call price could be less than
the price the trust paid for the bond.  If enough bonds are called, the
trust could terminate earlier than expected.


*  BONDS OF FOREIGN COMPANIES HELD BY THE TRUST PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE OF
U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market and political factors related
to the company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less
regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing
accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.


*  THE TRUST PORTFOLIO INCLUDES RESTRICTED BONDS.  A significant portion of
restricted bonds are issued under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and may only be resold to purchasers meeting certain
eligibility requirements in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to
federal securities laws or in a public offering with respect to which a
registration statement is in effect under the Securities Act.


*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited
circumstances, the trust will hold, and may continue to buy, the same bonds
even if the market value declines.




<F1>*  "AAM," "we" and related terms mean Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
trust sponsor, unless the context clearly suggests otherwise.



Investment Summary     3







WHO SHOULD INVEST



You should consider this investment if you want:


*  to own securities representing interests in high yield bonds in a single
investment.


*  the potential to receive monthly distributions of income.


You should not consider this investment if you:


*  are uncomfortable with the risks of an unmanaged investment in high yield
bonds.


*  want capital appreciation or capital preservation.

The transactional sales fee is paid at the time of a unit purchase and is the
difference between the total sales fee (maximum of 3.00% of the unit offering
price) and the total creation and development fee.  The creation and development
fee is fixed at $7.50 per unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the
initial offering period or six months after the trust's inception date.





EXAMPLE



This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every
$10,000 you invest in the trust:






1 year            $_____
3 years           $_____
5 years           $_____
10 years          $_____








These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

ILLUSTRATION OF SALES FEE DISCOUNTS



We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales fee you pay when you buy
units.  The table below shows what the public offering price per unit, estimated
current return and estimated long-term return would have been as of the close
of business on the business day prior to the trust's inception date based on
certain sales fee levels.  Please refer to "Understanding Your Investment--How
to Buy Units--Reducing Your Sales Fee" for details on the applicability of and
guidelines associated with all sales fee discounts.  Please refer to
"Understanding Your Investment--How Your Trust Works--Estimated Current and
Long-Term Returns" for more information about estimated current and long-term
returns. The public offering price per unit and interest income received by the
trust will vary over time for various reasons.  There is no assurance that the
estimated current returns or estimated long-term returns will be realized in
the future.

Investment Summary     7







Notes to Portfolio



(1)  The securities are represented by contracts to purchase such securities the
performance of which is secured by an irrevocable letter of credit.
Contracts to acquire the securities were entered into during the period
from ____________, 2013 to ____________, 2013 and have expected settlement
dates during the period from ____________, 2013 to ____________, 2013.


(2)  The bonds may be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant
to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur.


(3)  This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
the call price for that year.  Each bond continues to be callable at
declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with
respect to an issue of bonds.


(4)  The cost of each security is based on the current offering side evaluation
as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the business day prior to
the trust's inception date.  During the initial offering period,
evaluations of securities are made on the basis of current offering side
evaluations of the securities.  The aggregate offering price is greater
than the aggregate bid price of the securities, which is the basis on which
redemption prices will be determined for purposes of redemption of units
after the initial offering period.  In accordance with Accounting Standards
Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the trust's investments are
classified as Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using
significant observable inputs when quoted prices in active markets for
identical securities are not available.  Observable inputs are inputs such
as quoted prices for similar securities, quoted prices for identical
securities in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  The cost of
the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or (loss) (which is
the difference between the cost of the securities to the sponsor and the
cost of the securities to the trust) are $__________ and $__________,
respectively.


(5)  This security has a "make whole" call option and is redeemable in whole or
in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that
is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of the security, a
"make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption.  The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of
principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest
accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if
redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining
principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond
and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations
with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a
premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have
been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of the bonds being redeemed.


(6)  Any bond marked with this note has been purchased on a "when, as and if
issued" or "delayed delivery" basis.  Delivery of these bonds is expected
to take place at various dates after the first settlement date of the
trust, which is normally three business days following the trust's
inception date.  Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
unitholders on the related delivery dates for the bonds.


(7)  Any bond marked with this note was issued at an original issue discount.


(8)  This is a bond issued by a foreign company.


Corporate bonds comprise approximately 100.00% of the investments in the
trust, broken down by country of organization as set forth below:


(9)  This bond is subject to potential interest rate adjustments, not to exceed
2.00 percentage points above the bond's original interest rate, if either
Moody's Investor Service or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited
circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades their rating for this
bond (or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade).  The interest rate
set forth here represents the current interest rate applicable to the bond.


(10) The interest rate payable on this bond was adjusted in the past by a one-
time increase due to a ratings downgrade related to a corporate
acquisition. Any future credit rating improvements may result in a decrease
in the interest rate payable on this bond.  The interest rate set forth
here represents the current interest rate applicable to the bond.


(11) This security is a restricted security which may only be resold pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See
"Understanding Your Investment--Investment Risks--Restricted Bonds."

Investment Summary     9









UNDERSTANDING YOUR INVESTMENT





HOW TO BUY UNITS



You can buy units of a trust on any business day the New York Stock Exchange
is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are available
daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering price of
units includes:


*  the net asset value per unit plus


*  cash to pay organization costs plus


*  the sales fee plus


*  accrued interest, if any.


The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in a trust reduced by the liabilities of a trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.


ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the units represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the costs of creating
your trust.  These costs include the costs of preparing the registration
statement and legal documents, federal and state registration fees, HIMCO's
security selection fee, the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the
initial audit.  Your trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the
initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.  The value of your
units will decline when the trust pays these costs.


ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security
from the last day it paid interest.  Accrued interest on the trust units
consists of two elements.  The first element arises as a result of accrued
interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from
the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds.  Interest on the bonds is
generally paid semi-annually, although the trust accrues such interest daily.
Because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet
collected, the public offering price of units will have added to it the
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.  The second
element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trust's
interest account.  The trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until
it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to
advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions.  As a result,
interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to
advance funds in connection with such interest distributions.  If


10     Understanding Your Investment





you sell or redeem your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate
share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units.


VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities during the
initial offering period based on the aggregate offering side evaluations of the
securities determined (a) on the basis of current offering prices of the
securities, (b) if offering prices are not available for any particular
security, on the basis of current offering prices for comparable securities, (c)
by determining the value of securities on the offer side of the market by
appraisal, or (d) by any combination of the above.  After the initial offering
period ends, we generally determine the value of the securities as described in
the preceding sentence based on the bid side evaluations rather than the
offering side evaluations.  The offering side price generally represents the
price at which investors in the market are willing to sell a security and the
bid side evaluation generally represents the price that investors in the market
are willing to pay to buy a security.  The bid side evaluation is lower than the
offering side evaluation.  As a result of this pricing method, unitholders
should expect a decrease in the net asset value per unit on the day following
the end of the initial offering period equal to the difference between the
current offering side evaluation and bid side evaluation of the securities.


Capelogic, Inc., an independent pricing service, determined the initial
prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in this prospectus as described
above at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the
business day before the date of this prospectus.  On the first day we sell units
we will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the New
York Stock Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective, if later.


TRANSACTIONAL SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.
We refer to this fee as the "transactional sales fee."  You pay the
transactional sales fee at the time you buy units.  The maximum sales fee equals
3.00% of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  The
transactional sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage
(maximum of 3.00% of the public offering price per unit) and the fixed dollar
creation and development fee ($7.50 per unit).  The transactional sales fee
equals 2.25% of the public offering price per unit based on a $1,000 public
offering price per unit.  This percentage amount of the transactional sales fee
is based on the unit price on the trust's inception date.  Since the
transactional sales fee actually equals the difference between the total sales
fee and the creation and development fee, the percentage and dollar amount of
the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit
varies.  The transactional sales fee does not include the creation and
development fee which is described under "Expenses."


MINIMUM PURCHASE.  The minimum amount you can purchase of the trust appears
on page 4 under "Essential Information", but such amounts may vary depending on
your selling firm.


REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of
any discount when you order units.  Except as expressly provided herein, you may
not combine discounts.  Since the creation and development fee is a fixed dollar
amount per unit, your



Understanding Your Investment     11






trust must charge this fee per unit regardless of any discount.  However, if you
are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than
the fixed dollar amount of the creation and development fee, we will credit you
the difference between your total sales fee and the fixed dollar creation and
development fee at the time you buy units.


Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of
your investment:








 IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:
------------------------------------------

Less than 100 units           3.00%
100 - 249 units               2.75
250 - 499 units               2.50
500 - 999 units               2.25
1,000 - 4,999 units           2.00
5,000 - 9,999 units           1.75
10,000 or more units          1.50








We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  We also apply the different purchase levels on a dollar basis
using a $1,000 unit equivalent.  For example, if you invest between $250,000 and
$499,999, your fee is 2.50% of your public offering price per unit.


You aggregate initial offering period unit orders submitted by the same
person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one
broker-dealer to qualify for a purchase level.  If you purchase initial offering
period units that qualify for the fee account or exchange discount described
below and also purchase additional initial offering period units on a single day
from the same broker-dealer that do not qualify for the fee account or exchange
discount, you aggregate all initial offering period units purchased for purposes
of determining the applicable breakpoint level in the table above on the
additional units, but such additional units will not qualify for the fee account
or exchange discount described below.  Secondary market unit purchases are not
aggregated with initial offering period unit purchases for purposes of
determining the applicable breakpoint level.  You can also include these orders
as your own for purposes of this aggregation:


*  orders submitted by your spouse or children (including step-children)
under 21 years of age living in the same household and


*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.


The discounts described above apply only to initial offering period
purchases.


Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed. You should
consult your financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from
these accounts.  If units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the
units are subject to a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap
Fee Eligible"), then investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in
these Fee Accounts that are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will
be subject to the creation and development fee that is retained by the sponsor.
For example, this table illustrates the sales fee you will pay as a percentage
of the initial $1,000 public

offering price per unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).








Transactional sales fee          0.00%

                                =======








This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary
market.  Certain Fee Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees
on the purchase and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other
processing organizations for providing certain transaction or account
activities.  We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee
Accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is
determined to be detrimental to the trust.


Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by
officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of the sponsor
and its affiliates.  We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made
by officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of selling
firms.  These purchases are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will
be subject to the creation and development fee.  These purchases are made at the
public offering price per unit less the applicable underwriter or dealer
concession.  Immediate family members for the purposes of this section include
your spouse, children (including step-children) under the age of 21 living in
the same household, and parents (including step-parents).  These discounts apply
to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.  All employee
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm, including but
not limited to, householding policies or limitations.  Only officers, directors
and employees (and their immediate family members) of selling firms that allow
such persons to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for
the discount.


Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of the trust
offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or termination
proceeds from any unit investment trust (regardless of sponsor).  The discounted
sales fee for these transactions is 2.50% of the public offering price per unit
at the time of purchase.  However, if you use redemption or termination proceeds
to purchase 250 or more units of the trust, the maximum sales fee on your units
will be limited to the maximum sales fee for the applicable amount invested in
the table under "Large Purchases" above.  To qualify for this discount, the
termination or redemption proceeds used to purchase units of the trust offered
in this prospectus must be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30
calendar days of your purchase of units of the trust offered in this prospectus.
In addition, the discount will only be available for investors that utilize the
same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification)
for both the unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the
termination or redemption proceeds used for the unit purchase.  You may be
required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your
broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for this sales fee discount.


Please note that if you purchase units of a trust in this manner using
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.
These discounts apply only to initial offering period purchases.

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.



HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS



You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the
net asset value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation
and development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to
as the "liquidation price".  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or
other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.


SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the initial offering period.  We
may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or
redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase price is
the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a
secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial professional for
current repurchase prices to determine the best price available.  We may
discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice.  Even if we do not
make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any
business day for the current redemption price.


REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee,
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial
offering period.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if
the trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in
a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a timely manner or is
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after
the trustee receives your completed request.


If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for
your units no later


14     Understanding Your Investment





than seven days after it receives all necessary documentation (this will usually
only take three business days).  The only time the trustee can delay your
payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than weekends or
holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading on
that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of
the securities not reasonably practicable, and for any other period that the
Securities and Exchange Commission permits.


EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.



DISTRIBUTIONS



MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays interest from its net
investment income (pro-rated on an annual basis) along with any available
principal paid on the securities on each monthly distribution date to
unitholders of record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special
distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  The
amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as interest and
principal payments change or trust expenses change.


Interest received by your trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
trustee to your trust's "interest account".  Other receipts are credited to the
"principal account".  After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the
trustee, without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as
the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date, interest received will
be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date.  All distributions will be net of estimated expenses.
Funds in the principal account will be distributed on each distribution date to
unitholders of record as of the preceding record date provided that the amount
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per unit.


Because interest payments are not received by your trust at a constant rate
throughout the year and the interest rates on certain bonds in the trust may
adjust periodically, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount
credited to the interest account as of the record date.  For the purpose of
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the trustee is authorized to
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately
equal amounts.  The trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the
interest account on the next record date.  Investors who purchase units between
a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on
the second distribution date after the purchase.


ESTIMATED DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual interest income per unit,
estimated initial distribution per unit and estimated normal monthly
distribution per unit as of the close of business the day before your trust's
inception date are shown under "Essential Information" in



Understanding Your Investment     15






the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus.  We generally base these
amounts on the estimated cash flows of the bonds per unit based on the current
interest rate applicable to the bonds.  Since certain of the bonds may be
subject to potential interest rate adjustments related to changes in the bonds'
ratings provided by certain ratings services, estimated distributions may
fluctuate over time and actual distributions may vary from estimated amounts.
The actual distributions that you receive will vary from these estimates with
changes in expenses, interest rates (including interest rate adjustments related
to changes in the bonds' ratings as provided by certain ratings services) and
maturity, call, default or sale of bonds.  You may request the estimated cash
flows from the sponsor.  The estimated cash flows are computed based on factors
described under "Understanding Your Investment--How Your Trust Works--Estimated
Current and Long-Term Returns".


REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each
distribution.  Each year the trustee or your financial professional will also
provide an annual report on your trust's activity and certain tax information.
You can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your
tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust, if available.



INVESTMENT RISKS



All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.


MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the principal value.  Market value fluctuates in
response to various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates,
inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the
issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you
should remember that we do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell
a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed
fund.


INTEREST RATE RISK is the risk that the value of securities will fall if
interest rates, in general, increase.  The securities in your trust typically
fall in value when interest rates, in general, rise and rise in value when
interest rates, in general, fall.  Securities with longer periods before
maturity are often more sensitive to general interest rate changes.


Certain bonds in the portfolio may be subject to interest rate adjustments if
either Moody's Investor Services or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited
circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades the rating for such bond (or
upgrades the rating after such a downgrade).  The interest rates payable on
certain bonds in the


16     Understanding Your Investment





portfolio may have already been increased due to past ratings downgrades.  Any
future credit rating improvements on such bonds may result in decreases to the
interest rates payable on such bonds and, consequently, may adversely affect
both the income you receive from the securities in your trust and the value of
your units.  On the other hand, increases in a bond's interest rate related to
decreases in such bond's credit rating may place additional financial strain on
the bond's issuer which could result in further decreases in financial condition
and further credit rating decreases.  Additionally, an increase in a bond's
interest rate may increase the risk that the bond's issuer will prepay or "call"
the bond before its stated maturity.


CREDIT RISK is the risk that a security's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security.


HIGH YIELD SECURITY RISK.  The trust invests in high yield securities.  High
yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss
than securities with higher investment ratings.  The value of these securities
may decline significantly with increases in interest rates.  An economic
slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the
issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain
interest and principal payments.


High-yield or "junk" securities, the generic names for securities rated below
"BBB" by Standard & Poor's or "Baa" by Moody's, are frequently issued by
corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established
companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are
depressed.  Securities rated below BBB or Baa are considered speculative as
these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade.  Because high-
yield securities are perceived by investors to be riskier than higher rated
securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated securities and
are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.


The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for
investment grade securities.  High-yield securities are generally not listed on
a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets.  Due
to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield securities, the bid-offer
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to
complete.


CALL RISK is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates, in general fall
and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for
the original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, your trust will distribute the
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall.  You might
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield.  A bond's call price
could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the
bond's par value.  This means that you could receive less than the amount you
paid for your units.  If enough bonds in your trust are called, your trust could
terminate early.  Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary
optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain
changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other
casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and
various other events.  The call provisions are described in general terms in the
"Portfolio".



Understanding Your Investment     17






BOND QUALITY RISK is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


RESTRICTED BONDS.  The trust portfolio may include bonds that may only be
resold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Such bonds may
not be readily marketable.


Restricted bonds may be sold only to purchasers meeting certain eligibility
requirements in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with
respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the Securities Act.
Where registration of such securities under the Securities Act is required, the
trust may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the
time the trust may be permitted to sell a security under an effective
registration statement.  If, during such a period, adverse market conditions
were to develop, the trust might obtain a less favorable price than that which
prevailed when it decided to sell.


CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry
because the portfolio concentrates in securities issued by companies within that
industry.  A portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when securities in a
particular industry make up 25% or more of the portfolio.


LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid
trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally
trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities
exchange).  Certain bonds in the portfolio may not have been registered by the
issuer under the Securities Act of 1933.


FOREIGN ISSUER RISK.  Because the trust invests in securities of foreign
companies, the trust involves additional risks that differ from an investment
exclusively in securities of domestic issuers.  These risks include the risk of
losses due to future political and economic developments, international trade
conditions, foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments
and exchange of securities.  The trust also involves the risk that fluctuations
in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively
affect the value of the securities.  The trust involves the risk that
information about the securities is not publicly available or is inaccurate due
to the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards.  In
addition, some foreign securities markets are less liquid than U.S. markets.
This could cause the trust to buy securities at a higher price or sell
securities at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid market.
Foreign securities markets are often more volatile and involve higher trading
costs than U.S. markets, and foreign companies, securities markets and brokers
are also generally not subject to the same level of supervision and regulation
as in the U.S.


LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISK is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your trust.  Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on securities.


EVENT RISK is the risk is the risk that corporate issuers may undergo
restructurings, such as mergers, leveraged buyouts, takeovers or similar events
financed by increased debt.  As a result of the


18     Understanding Your Investment





added debt, the credit quality and market value of an issuer's bonds may decline
significantly.


"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  "When, as and if issued" bonds
are bonds that trade before they are actually issued.  Bonds purchased on a
"when issued" basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trust's
inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds.  This
means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust "when, as and if" the
bonds are actually issued.  In addition, other bonds may have been purchased by
the sponsor on a "delayed delivery" basis.  These bonds are expected to be
delivered to the trust after the trust's first settlement date (normally three
business days after the trust's inception date).


Delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these
bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the
trust.  The trust may have to adjust the tax basis of any bonds delivered after
the expected delivery date.  Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued
between the purchase and the delivery of the bonds to your trust.  This could
lower your first year estimated current return.  You may experience gains or
losses related to these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your
trust has not yet received them.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Original issue discount bonds were initially
issued at a price below their face (or par) value.  These bonds typically pay a
lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par
value.  In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds
tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the
bonds approach maturity.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or
redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the
bond's par value.  Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the
difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price
of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is
treated as taxable interest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond.  These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life.  If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity.  The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


MARKET DISCOUNT.  Your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market
values were below the principal value on the trust's inception date or your unit
purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less
than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower
rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds.  Bonds selling
at market discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity.


PREMIUM BONDS.  Your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market
values were above the principal value on the trust's inception date or your unit
purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher
than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher
rate than the current market interest rates for comparable



Understanding Your Investment     19






bonds.  The current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially
higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value
as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable.  Because
part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through
current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond at par or any other
amount below the trust's purchase price will result in a reduction in yield.
Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant
to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the bonds have a market
value that represents a premium over par or for original issue discount
securities a premium over the accreted value.



HOW YOUR TRUST WORKS



YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  At the
close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trusts' inception date, the number
of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals
$1,000.  The number of units, fractional interest of each unit in a trust,
estimated interest distributions per unit and estimated current and long-term
returns will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.


CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Under normal
circumstances, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in high yield
bonds.  Your trust will generally buy and sell securities:


*  to pay expenses,


*  to issue additional units or redeem units,


*  in limited circumstances to protect a trust,


*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on a trust, or


*  as permitted by the trust agreement.


When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  Your trust will generally reject
any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its
portfolio.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will either
hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or
property and distribute the proceeds.


We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create
additional units, we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the
principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio.  When your trust buys
securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You could
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities.  Because the


20     Understanding Your Investment





trusts pay the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with
the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent
redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage
expenses.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we may direct that it place
orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that sell units or are
affiliated with your trust or the trustee.


In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the
trust under a contract ("failed bonds"), the sponsor is authorized to purchase
other bonds ("replacement bonds").  The trustee shall pay for replacement bonds
out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery
of such bonds to make up the original principal of a trust.  The replacement
bonds must be purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the
failed contract, and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not
exceed the principal attributable to the failed bonds.  Whenever a replacement
bond has been acquired for a trust, the trustee shall, within five days
thereafter, notify all unitholders of a trust of the acquisition of the
replacement bond and shall, on the next distribution date which is more than 30
days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which
the cost to a trust of the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement
bond.  In addition, a replacement bond must (at the time of purchase):


*  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed
bond it replaces;


*  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a
current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity
and current return of the failed bond which it replaces; and


*  be rated at least in the category of BBB/Baa or the equivalent by a major
rating organization.


If the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to
acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract, the sponsor will
refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of
the trust, and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the
next monthly distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter.  In the
event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust, the estimated net annual
interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long-
term returns might be lowered.


REMOVING SECURITIES FROM THE TRUST.  The trust portfolio is not managed.
However, where permitted by the trust agreement we may, but are not required to,
direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain limited circumstances,
including situations in which:


*  The issuer of the security has defaulted in the payment of principal or
interest on the securities;


*  Any action or proceeding seeking to restrain or enjoin the payment of
principal or interest on the securities has been instituted;


*  There is any legal question or impediment affecting the security;


*  The issuer of the security has breached a covenant which would affect the
payment of principal or interest on the security, the issuer's credit
standing, or otherwise damage the sound investment character of the
security;


*  The issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its outstanding
obligations;



Understanding Your Investment     21






*  Such securities are the subject of an advanced refunding;


*  Such factors arise which, in our opinion, adversely affect the tax status
of the securities;


*  The sale of securities is necessary or advisable (i) in order to maintain
the qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment company" or (ii)
to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable year in order to
avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on undistributed income in
the trust;


*  The price of the security has declined to such an extent, or such other
credit factors exist, that in our opinion keeping the security would be
harmful to the trust and the interest of unitholders; and


*  The sale of the security is necessary for the trust to comply with such
federal and/or state securities laws, regulations and/or regulatory actions
and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time.


ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS.  The estimated current return and
the estimated long-term return as of the business day before a trust's inception
date are shown under "Essential Information" and "Illustration of Sales Fee
Discounts" in the "Investment Summary" section for your trust.  Estimated
current return is calculated by dividing the current estimated net annual
interest income per unit based on the interest rates currently applicable to the
bonds by the public offering price.  The estimated net annual interest income
per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates applicable to the bonds
(some of which may be subject to adjustments related to changes in the bonds'
ratings as provided by certain ratings services), fees and expenses of your
trust and with the default, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds.
The public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present estimated current return
will be realized in the future.  Estimated long-term return is calculated using
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales
charge associated with units.  The applicable sales charge associated with units
will vary based on sales fee reductions applicable to certain unitholders.
Since the interest rates, value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the
expenses of your trust may change, there is no assurance that the present
estimated long-term return will be realized in the future.  The estimated
current return and estimated long-term return are expected to differ because the
calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes
only net annual interest income and public offering price.


In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the sponsor or
trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on
the trust's inception date.  This cash may exceed the interest which would
accrue to the first settlement date.  The trustee has agreed to pay for any
amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become
available from interest payments on the related bonds.


WEIGHTED AVERAGE MODIFIED DURATION.  The weighted average modified duration
of the securities


22     Understanding Your Investment





in the trust portfolio as of the business day before the trust's inception date
is shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section for
your trust.  Modified duration is a calculation that expresses the measurable
change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates.
Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move
in opposite directions.  This formula is used to determine the effect that a 1%
change in interest rates might have on the price of a bond.  For example, if a
portfolio has a duration of 3 years then that portfolio's value is estimated to
decline approximately 3% for each 1% increase in interest rates or rise
approximately 3% for each 1% decrease in interest rates.  Weighted average
modified duration of the securities will vary with changes in the value and
yield of bonds and with the default, redemption, maturity, exchange, sale or
other liquidation of bonds.  The weighted average modified duration of the
securities shown under "Essential Information" relates only to the bonds in the
trust and not to the trust itself or units.  Modified duration does not account
for the trust sales charge or expenses and is not intended to predict or
guarantee future performance of the bonds or the trust.


AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this
agreement.


TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate upon the maturity,
payment, redemption, sale or other liquidation of all of the securities in the
portfolio.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust
is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at the
time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue
burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your
trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate
the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the
public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of a trust would be
reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were
deposited in a trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales charge that you
paid.


The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you
originally paid for your units.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite 102, Wichita, Kansas 67226 or
by using the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a
registered broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor or become
bankrupt, the



Understanding Your Investment     23






trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust without a sponsor, or
terminate your trust.


We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your
trust.


THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with
its principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place,
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some
cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and
investors.


PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The portfolio consultant, Hartford Investment
Management Company, is a registered investment adviser.  HIMCO manages over $120
billion in assets primarily for institutional and other client portfolios.


HIMCO is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  HIMCO selected a list of
securities to be included in the portfolio based on the criteria provided by the
sponsor.  HIMCO makes no representations that the portfolio will achieve the
investment objectives or will be profitable or suitable for any particular
potential investor.  The sponsor did not select the securities for the trust.


HIMCO may use the list of securities in its independent capacity as an
investment adviser and distribute this information to various individuals and
entities.  HIMCO may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect transactions
in the securities held by the trust.  This may have an adverse effect on the
prices of the securities.  This also may have an impact on the price the trust
pays for the securities and the price received upon unit redemptions or
liquidation of the securities.  HIMCO also issues reports and makes
recommendations on securities, which may include the securities in the trust.


Neither HIMCO nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions expressed by HIMCO
are not necessarily those of the sponsor, and may not actually prove correct.
HIMCO is being compensated for its portfolio consulting services, including
selection of the trust portfolio.


HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through underwriters
and other broker-dealers and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these
distribution firms when they sell units.  Units will be distributed to the
public by these firms at the public offering price per unit as described under
"How to Buy Units".


Underwriter Compensation.  The underwriters for your trust and the amounts of
units underwritten are listed under "Underwriting" in the "Investment Summary"
section for your trust.  As sponsor and principal underwriter, we sell these
units to the underwriters at the regular public offering price per unit less a
concession per unit as set forth in the following table:








     AGGREGATE AMOUNT               UNDERWRITER
     ORIGINALLY UNDERWRITTEN         CONCESSION
     ------------------------------------------

     500 - 999 units                   $21.00
     1,000 - 2,499 units                21.50
     2,500 - 4,999 units                22.00
     5,000 or more units                22.50


24     Understanding Your Investment











The minimum underwriting commitment per trust is 500 units.


In addition, with respect to all subsequent unit purchases by an underwriter
above the original underwriting commitment, an underwriter will be allowed an
initial offering period broker-dealer concession equal to the original
underwriter concession applicable to the underwriter as set forth in the table
above if more favorable to the underwriter than the broker-dealer concessions
described below under "Broker-Dealer Compensation".


In addition to any other benefits underwriters may realize from the sale of
units, the sponsor will share on a pro rata basis among underwriters that
underwrite 500 or more units of a single trust 50% of any gain (less deductions
for accrued interest and certain costs) represented by the difference between
the cost of the bonds in such trust to the sponsor and the valuation of the
bonds in such trust on the trust's inception date.


Broker-Dealer Compensation.  During the initial offering period, the
distribution fee (the broker-dealer concession or agency commission) for non-
underwriter broker-dealers and other firms is as follows:








                                CONCESSION
                                 OR AGENCY
  TRANSACTION AMOUNT            COMMISSION
-------------------------------------------

Less than 100 units               $20.00
100 - 249 units                    17.50
250 - 499 units                    15.00
500 - 999 units                    12.00
1,000 - 4,999 units                11.00
5,000 - 9,999 units                10.00
10,000 or more units                9.00








We apply these concessions as a fixed dollar amount per unit net of any sales
fee discount.  The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration
purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to
the requirement that only whole units be issued.  We also apply the breakpoints
in the table above on a dollar basis using a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per
unit and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the broker-
dealer or selling agent.


For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts who
use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust
offered in this prospectus, the concession or agency commission is $15.00 per
unit.


No concession or agency commission is paid to broker-dealers or other selling
firms in connection with unit sales in Fee Accounts that charge a Wrap Fee.


Underwriters other than the sponsor will sell units of the trusts to other
broker-dealers and selling agents at the public offering price per unit less a
concession or agency commission not in excess of the underwriter concession
allowed to the underwriter by the sponsor as described under "Underwriter
Compensation" above.


After the initial offering period, the broker-dealer concession or agency
commission for secondary market transactions is equal to 2.50% of the public
offering price.


Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of
the concession or agency commission, except as stated above.  We reserve the
right to change the amount of concessions or agency commissions from time to
time.


General.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit
investment trusts for



Understanding Your Investment     25






which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional compensation for
volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume concession structures for
certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume Concession A" and "Volume
Concession B."  The trust offered in this prospectus is a Volume Concession B
trust.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of any Volume Concession
B trust are eligible to receive the additional compensation described below.
Such payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to firms as
set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus. The additional concession is
based on total initial offering period sales of all Volume Concession B trusts
during a calendar quarter as set forth in the following table:








  INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD SALES                  VOLUME
     DURING CALENDAR QUARTER                   CONCESSION
---------------------------------------------------------

Less than $100,000,000                           0.000%
$100,000,000 but less than $250,000,000          0.050
$250,000,000 or more                             0.100








This volume concession will be paid on units of all Volume Concession B trust
units sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.
Currently, series of Advisors Corporate Trust High Yield Bond Portfolio,
Advisors Corporate Trust--Navellier/Dial High Income Opportunities Portfolio,
Build America Bond Limited Maturity Portfolio, Build America Bond Portfolio,
Insured Tax Exempt Municipal Portfolio, Municipal Opportunities Portfolio, Tax
Exempt Municipal Portfolio and Tax Exempt Securities Trust are classified as
Volume Concession B trusts; however, other trusts may be classified as Volume
Concession B trusts in the future and eligible for this additional compensation
for calendar quarter sales as disclosed in the applicable trust prospectus.  For
a trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession B compensation for
calendar quarter sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related
to this additional Volume Concession B compensation.  A trust is not eligible
for this additional Volume Concession B compensation if the prospectus for such
trust does not include disclosure related to this additional Volume Concession B
compensation.  Other trusts sponsored by AAM are eligible to receive different
categories of additional compensation for volume sales as set forth in the
applicable trust's prospectus.  Broker dealer-firms will not receive
compensation unless they sell at least $100 million of units of Volume
Concession B trusts during a calendar quarter.  For example, if a firm sells
$99.5 million of units of Volume Concession B trusts during a calendar quarter,
the firm will not receive any additional compensation with respect to such
trusts.  Once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter, the firm
will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period sales
of Volume Concession B trust units during the applicable quarter.  For example,
if a firm sells $115 million of units of Volume Concession B trusts in the
initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive
additional compensation of 0.05% of $115 million and if a firm sells $275
million of units of Volume Concession B trusts in the initial offering period
during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional compensation of
0.10% of $275 million.  In addition, selling firms will not receive the
additional compensation on the sale of units which are not subject to a
transactional sales charge.  However, such sales will be included in determining
whether a firm has met the volume sales concession breakpoints.  Secondary
market sales of units are excluded for purposes of the additional compensation.
We will pay these amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time
following each calendar quarter.


We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,
additional compensation


26     Understanding Your Investment





and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this trust and our other
products.  This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our
products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past sales.
A number of factors are considered in determining whether to pay these
additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the level
or type of services provided by the intermediary, the level or expected level of
sales of our products by the intermediary or its agents, the placing of our
products on a preferred or recommended product list and access to an
intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of unit sales among an
intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in broker-
dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of our
products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of intermediaries
that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or on behalf of,
intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the purpose of
facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or purchasing trading
systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional compensation
described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described above, some of
which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an incentive for
financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our products,
including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will not change
the price you pay for your units.


We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in
part.


We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to
create units.



TAXES



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal
tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.



Understanding Your Investment     27






TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's
distributions into three categories, ordinary income distributions, capital
gains dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary income distributions are
generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below,
certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at
the capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains
dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your
units.  To determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends,
you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In
addition, the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status
of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest
your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from
your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had
received them on December 31 of the previous year.  Under the "Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from the trust may also be subject
to a  new 3.8 percent "medicare tax" imposed for taxable years beginning after
2012.  This tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your
adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in
the case of married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of
single individuals.


DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.


SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.


CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is
generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for taxpayers in the
25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax
brackets.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the


28     Understanding Your Investment





asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you purchase your units to
determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a capital gain dividend
from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or
less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for capital gains realized
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary
income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital gains as ordinary
income in special situations.


Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself.  For years
beginning after December 31, 2012, all ordinary income dividends are subject to
ordinary income tax rates.  The trust will provide notice to its unitholders of
the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend
which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates.


EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over
into a future trust, the exchange would generally be considered a sale for
federal income tax purposes.


DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In  some cases,
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as
income.  In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.  Some individuals may also
be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions,
depending on their income.


FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.


FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust properly reports as
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However,
distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly
reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes
certain elections and certain other conditions are met.  In the case of
dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to 2014,
distributions from the trust that are properly reported by the trust as an
interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest income received by
the trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net
short-term capital gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S.
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes when received by



Understanding Your Investment     29






certain foreign investors, provided that the trust makes certain elections and
certain other conditions are met.  In addition, distributions in respect of
units after December 31, 2013 may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in
the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S. financial institutions that
have not entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and
disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has
entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and (ii) certain other
non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications and information
about the entity's U.S. owners.  Dispositions of units by such persons may be
subject to such withholding after December 31, 2016.  You should also consult
your tax advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting
requirements.



EXPENSES



Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the
estimated amount of these expenses.


The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and
development fee" is a charge of $7.50 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period.
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of
the initial public offering period.


Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on pages 6 through 8, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 1060, as of
____________, 2013, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our
audit.


We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities
as shown in the statement of financial condition as of ____________, 2013.  We
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 1060 as of ____________, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the offer side evaluations as

     interest accrued to the first settlement date to the trust for distribution
     to the sponsor as unitholder of record as of such date.
(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee
     covering the funds (aggregating $__________) necessary for the purchase of
     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the trust.
     These costs have been estimated at $______ per unit for the trust.  A
     distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial
     offering period or six months following the trust's inception date to an
     account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.
(4)  The total sales fee consists of a transactional sales fee and a creation &
     development fee.  The transactional sales fee is equal to the difference
     between the maximum sales fee and the creation & development fee.  The
     maximum sales fee is equal to 3.00% of the public offering price.  The
     creation &development fee is equal to $7.50 per unit.  A portion of the
     public offering price per unit consists of an amount of cash to pay this
     fee.
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION



Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).


When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering
price per unit equals $1,000.  The number of units, fractional interest of each
unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in principal
amounts which will generally maintain the same original percentage relationship
among the principal amounts of the securities in such trust established by the
initial deposit of the securities.  Thus, although additional units will be
issued, each unit will generally continue to represent the same principal amount
of each security, and the percentage relationship among the principal amount of
each security in the related trust will generally remain the same.  If the
sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities, existing and new
investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and
because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.


Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the
trust agreement.


A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure
in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any
of the securities initially


-2-





deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless substantially all of the
moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute
securities in accordance with the trust agreement, refund the cash and sales fee
attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution
date.



INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES



The trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income by
investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of high yield corporate debt
securities (commonly known as "junk bonds").  There is, of course, no guarantee
that the trust will achieve its objective.  The prospectus provides additional
information regarding the trust's objective and investment strategy.


The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic,
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.


The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in the special circumstances discussed herein
regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities.
Thus, with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in
accordance with their terms, the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under
normal circumstances.


The sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of
which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of
certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market
factors, including advance refunding, so that in the opinion of the sponsor the
retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of
the unitholders.  The proceeds from any such sales, exclusive of any portion
which represents accrued interest, will be credited to the Principal Account of
such trust for distribution to the unitholders.


The sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of securities to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for
trust securities, the trustee shall reject such offer.  However, should any
issuance, exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or
without an initial offer, any securities or property received shall be deposited
in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor
advises the trustee to keep such securities or properties.  The excess cash
proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders.


If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in
the portfolio


-3-





or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.  The sponsor may
direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct
result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the sponsor,
would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In such a
case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale
proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the
trust on the trust's inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the trustee
to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the
qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.


The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.


In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment
company.


Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Principal
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the
portfolio securities is prohibited.


Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in
accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be
distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can be given
that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and
composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for
any default, failure or defect in any security.  In the event of a failure to
deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract,
including those securities purchased on a "when, as and if issued" basis
("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to
direct the trustee to acquire other securities ("Replacement Securities") to
make up the original corpus of such trust.


Securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a "when, as
and if issued" or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place
after the first settlement date.  Accordingly, the delivery of such securities
may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these securities begins accruing
to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery.
Unitholders of all trusts will be "at risk" with respect to any "when, as and if
issued" or "delayed delivery" securities included in their respective trust
(i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of
such securities) from the date they commit for units.


The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the
purchase price may not exceed the


-4-





amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Securities.  The
Replacement Securities (i) shall be bonds, debentures, notes or other straight
debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether senior or
subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed maturity
dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Securities, having no
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) shall be payable in United
States currency; (iii) shall not be "when, as and if issued" obligations or
restricted securities; (iv) shall be issued after July 18, 1984 if interest
thereon is United States source income; (v) shall be issued or guaranteed by an
issuer subject to or exempt from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or
in effect guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by means by of a lease agreement,
agreement to buy securities, services or products, or other similar commitment
of the credit of such an issuer to the payment of the Replacement Securities;

(vi) if the prospectus for the related trust provides that an objective of such
trust is to provide income exempt from United States federal taxation, shall be
securities issued by states or territories of the United States or political
subdivisions thereof which shall have the benefit of an exemption from United
States federal taxation of interest to an extent equal to or greater than that
of the Securities they replace and, if the prospectus for the related trust
provides that an objective of such trust is to provide income exempt from state
taxation, shall have the benefit of an exemption from state taxation to an
extent equal to or greater than that of the Securities they replace; and

(vii) shall not cause the units of the related trust to cease to be rated "AAA"
by Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. if the units
are so rated. The purchase price of the Replacement Securities (exclusive of
accrued interest) shall not exceed the principal attributable to the Failed
Securities. In addition, no substitution of Replacement Securities will be made
without an opinion of counsel that such substitution will not adversely affect
the federal income tax status of the related trust, if such Replacement
Securities when added to all previously purchased Replacement Securities in the
related trust exceed 15% of the principal amount of Securities initially
deposited in the related trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for
a trust, the trustee shall, within five days thereafter, notify all unitholders
of the trust of the acquisition of the Replacement Security and shall, on the
next monthly distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro
rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the
Failed Security exceeded the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the
securities in a trust are acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the
investments of the trust, i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to
take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholder's investment.


If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the
principal and accrued interest attributable to such Failed Securities not more
than 30 days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to
purchase a Replacement Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that,
at the time of receipt of such principal, they may not be able to reinvest such
proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which
such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust.


Whether or not a Replacement Security is acquired, an amount equal to the
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Securities) will be paid to
unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the Failed Securities
from the trust if the sponsor determines not to


-5-





purchase a Replacement Security or to the date of substitution if a Replacement
Security is purchased.  All such interest paid to unitholders which accrued
after the date of settlement for a purchase of units will be paid by the
sponsor.  In the event a Replacement Security could not be acquired by a trust,
the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the
estimated current return and estimated long-term return might be lowered.


Subsequent to the trust's inception, a security may cease to be rated or
its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trust's
inception.  Neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a
trust, but may be considered in the sponsor's determination to direct the
trustee to dispose of such investment.


The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the
happening of certain extraordinary circumstances.  Certain of the securities may
be subject to optional call or mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund
provisions, in each case prior to their stated maturity.  A bond subject to
optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to
maturity at the option of the issuer, often at a premium over par.  A refunding
is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the
proceeds of a new bond issue.  A bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one
which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a
fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to
maturity.  Special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for
redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances.  Redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely
to occur, and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption
provisions may occur, when the securities have an offering side evaluation which
represents a premium over par, that is, when they are able to be refinanced at a
lower cost.  The proceeds from any such call or redemption pursuant to sinking
fund provisions, as well as proceeds from the sale of securities and from
securities which mature in accordance with their terms from a trust, unless
utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption, will be distributed to
unitholders of such trust and will not be used to purchase additional securities
for such trust.  Accordingly, any such call, redemption, sale or maturity will
reduce the size and diversity of a trust and the net annual interest income of
such trust and may reduce the estimated current return and the estimated long-
term return.  The call, redemption, sale or maturity of securities also may have
tax consequences to a unitholder.


Certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired
at a market discount from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on
the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds
of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued
comparable securities increase, the market discount of previously issued
securities will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued
comparable securities decline, the market discount of previously issued
securities will be reduced, other things being equal.  Investors should also
note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase
in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates
decrease.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of securities
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at
a market premium.  In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of
higher yielding, premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower
yielding, discount securities will be reduced.  A discount security held to
maturity will have a


-6-





larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital
gain and loss in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a comparable
security newly issued at current market rates.  Market discount attributable to
interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue.
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default,
failure or defect in any of the securities.


Certain of the securities in the trust may be "zero coupon" bonds, i.e., an
original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current
interest.  Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments.  The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
obligation.  This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates
the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as
high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time
eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future.  For
this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price
fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are
securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently.


To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.



RISK FACTORS



MARKET DISCOUNT.  Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds
at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the
current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and
type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the
market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of
previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors
should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will
increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest
rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of bonds
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a
market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of
higher yielding, premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding,
discount bonds will be reduced. Market discount attributable to interest changes
does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue.  Neither the sponsor
nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.


-7-





HIGH YIELD SECURITY RISK. The trust invests in high yield securities. High
yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss
than securities with higher investment ratings.  The value of these securities
may decline significantly with increases in interest rates. An economic
slowdown, or a reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the
issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain
interest and principal payments.  High-yield or "junk" securities, the generic
names for securities rated below "BBB" by Standard & Poor's or "Baa" by Moody's,
are frequently issued by corporations in the growth stage of their development
or by established companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or
industries are depressed. Securities rated below BBB or Baa are considered
speculative as these ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade.
Because high-yield securities are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.  The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than
that for investment grade securities. High-yield securities are generally not
listed on a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter
markets. Due to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield securities, the
bid-offer spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for
investment grade securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take
longer to complete.


PREMIUM BONDS.  Certain of the bonds held by the trust may have been
acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest
rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were
higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of
comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued and
otherwise comparable bonds decrease, the market premium of previously issued
bonds will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable
bonds increase, the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced,
other things being equal.  The current returns of bonds trading at a market
premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a
similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds
tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount
becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond
at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield.
Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant
to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an
offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original
issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value.


ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon"
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
obligation. This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates
the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as
high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time
eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For
this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price
fluctuations during


-8-





periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable
quality which pay interest.


"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  Certain of the bonds may have
been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. See
"Notes to Portfolio" in the prospectus. The delivery of any such bonds may be
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these Bonds begins accruing to the benefit
of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. To the extent any bonds
are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of
delivery, unitholders who purchase their unit prior to the date such bonds are
actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in
their unit for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the
interval between their purchase of unit and the actual delivery of such bonds.
As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated Current Returns during the
first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the Prospectus which
would be the returns after the first year, assuming the portfolio of a trust and
estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee (which may be reduced
in the first year only) do not vary from that set forth in the prospectus.
Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all bonds in the portfolios
including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed delivery" bonds (i.e., may
derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds)
from the date they commit for unit.


ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent)
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations
in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the
purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage
fees and other acquisition costs.



ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST



DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Interest received by a trust, including any
portion of the proceeds from a disposition of securities which represents
accrued interest, is credited by the trustee to the Interest Account for the
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Principal
Account for the trust.  The trustee normally has no cash for distribution to
unitholders until it receives interest payments on the securities in the trust.
On the dates set forth under "Essential Information" in the prospectus, the
trustee will commence distributions, in part from funds advanced by the trustee.


Thereafter, assuming the trust retains its original size and composition,
after deduction of the fees and expenses and reimbursements (without interest)
to the trustee for any amounts advanced to a trust, the trustee will normally
distribute any income and principal received by the trust on each distribution
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding Record
Date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata
share of the balance of the Interest Account.  However, interest earned at any
point in time will generally be greater than the amount actually received by the
trustee.  Therefore, there will generally remain an item of accrued interest
that is added to the daily value of the units.  If unitholders sell or


-9-





redeem all or a portion of their units, they will be paid their proportionate
share of the accrued interest to, but not including, the third business day
after the date of a sale or to the date of tender in the case of a redemption.


Unitholders of record on the first record date will receive an interest
distribution on the first distribution date.  Because the period of time between
the first distribution date and the regular distribution dates may not be a full
period, the first regular distributions may be partial distributions.


Persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date
will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date following
their purchase of units.  Since interest on securities in the trust is payable
at varying intervals and distributions are made to unitholders at different
intervals from receipt of interest, the interest accruing to a trust may not be
equal to the amount of money received and available for distribution from the
Interest Account.  Therefore, on each distribution date the amount of interest
actually deposited in the Interest Account and available for distribution may be
slightly more or less than the interest distribution made.  In order to
eliminate fluctuations in interest distributions resulting from such variances,
the trustee is authorized by the trust agreement to advance such amounts as may
be necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts.
The trustee will be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from
funds available in the Interest Account.


The trustee will distribute on each distribution date or shortly
thereafter, to each unitholder of record on the preceding record date, an amount
substantially equal to such holder's pro rata share of the available cash
balance, if any, in the Principal Account computed as of the close of business
on the preceding record date.  However, no distribution will be required if the
balance in the Principal Account is less than $1.00 per unit.


STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.


The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:


(A)  As to the Interest Account:


(1)  Income received;


(2)  Deductions for applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the trust
and for redemptions of units, if any; and


-10-





(3)  The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar
amount representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the
last business day of such calendar year; and


(B)  As to the Principal Account:


(1)  The dates of disposition of any securities and the net proceeds
received therefrom;


(2)  Deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and expenses of
the trust and for redemptions of units, if any; and


(3)  The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions
expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
representing the pro rata share of each unit outstanding on the last
business day of such calendar year; and


(C)  The following information:


(1)  A list of the securities as of the last business day of such calendar
year;


(2)  The number of units outstanding on the last business day of such
calendar year;


(3)  The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during such
calendar year;


(4)  The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from the
Interest and Principal Accounts separately stated, expressed both as
total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit outstanding on the
record dates for each such distribution.


RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.


AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be
amended, however, without the consent of all


-11-





unitholders then outstanding, so as (1) to permit, except in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, the acquisition hereunder of any securities other
than those specified in the schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce
the percentage of units the holders of which are required to consent to certain
of such amendments.  The trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the
interest in a trust represented by units without the consent of all affected
unitholders.  Except for the amendments, changes or modifications described
above, neither the sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment,
change or modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and
the obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal
income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in
the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such
amendment.


The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the
maturity, liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the
securities held in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the
mandatory termination date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the
applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total
value of securities deposited in the trust during the initial offering period),
the trustee may, in its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor,
terminate the trust.  A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of
units representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.    A trust
will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units
of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor, so that
the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the
securities at the time they were deposited in the trust. If a trust is
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor, the sponsor
will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee paid by such
purchaser.


Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata
share of the balances remaining in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the
trust.


THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of
New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


-12-





The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.


Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.


The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor,
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided
profits of not less than $5,000,000.


THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
The sponsor is a broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-
dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial
professionals. The sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,
Monument, Colorado 80132. You can contact the unit investment trust


-13-





division at 8100 East 22nd Street North, Building 800, Suite 102, Wichita,
Kansas 67226 or by using the contacts listed on the back cover of the
prospectus. The sponsor is a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser and
a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and a registrant of the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).


If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the
trust agreement.


THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor
and trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.
Such resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of
appointment by the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no
successor has accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of
resignation, the evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and
appointment shall be mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.


LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale
of any securities.


The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
trustee.


The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided,
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the

trustee or unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its
obligations under the trust agreement.


EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.


The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The amount of this
"creation and development fee" is set forth in the prospectus. The trustee will
deduct this amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial
offering period. No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of
distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be
deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of
units before the close of the initial public offering period.


The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Principal and Interest Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest
bearing and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part
of the trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result
from the use of these funds.


The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate
cost to the sponsor for providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.


For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at
the end of each month.


For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when
combined with all compensation from other unit


-15-





investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation
services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall
be based on the total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of
January 1 for any annual period, except during the initial offering period the
fee will be based on the units outstanding at the end of each month.


The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are
deducted from the Interest Account of the related trust to the extent funds are
available and then from the Principal Account.  Each such fee (other than any
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.


The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust:

(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;

(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;

(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the
trust.  If the balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient
to provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration
statement each year.



PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS



PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  During the initial offering period, the public offering price
per unit is equal to the net asset value per unit (generally based on the
offering side evaluations of the securities) plus the applicable sales fee
referred to in the prospectus plus cash deposited to pay organization costs plus
accrued interest, if any. The transactional sales fee is equal to the difference
between the maximum sales fee and the total creation and development fee.  The
public offering price for secondary market transactions, on the other hand, is
based on the net asset value per unit (generally based on the bid side
evaluations of the securities) plus a sales fee plus cash deposited to pay
organization costs plus accrued interest, if any.  The sales fee as a percentage
of the public offering price and the net amount invested is set forth in the
prospectus.  The creation and development fee is a fixed dollar amount and will
be collected at the end of the initial offering period as described in the
prospectus.  Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable
creation and development fee has been collected will not be assessed the
remaining creation and development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.
During the initial offering period, a portion of the


-16-





public offering price includes an amount of cash or securities to pay for all or
a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a trust.  These costs include
the cost of preparing the registration statement, the trust indenture and other
closing documents, registering units with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and states, the initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees and the initial
fees and expenses of the trustee.  These costs will be deducted from a trust as
of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.
Following the end of the initial offering period, the public offering price for
secondary market transactions is based on the net asset value per unit
(generally based on the bid side evaluations of the securities) plus a sales fee
plus cash deposited to pay organization costs plus accrued interest, if any.
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing unit
purchases.


As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
each such day as discussed in the prospectus.  Orders received by the trustee,
sponsor or any authorized financial professionals for purchases, sales or
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is
closed, will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the
prospectus.


Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus.
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of
the underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units.  Net
asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trust's portfolio
securities (including any accrued interest), cash and other assets, less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses), by the total number of units
outstanding.  The portfolio securities are valued at their current market value
or their fair value as determined in good faith by the Evaluator.  The aggregate
bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined (a) on
the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities, (b) if bid or
offering prices are not available for any particular security, on the basis of
current bid or offering prices for comparable securities, (c) by determining the
value of securities on the bid or offer side of the market by appraisal, or

(d) by any combination of the above.


The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made
during the preceding 24-hour period.


The interest on the securities deposited in a trust, less the related
estimated fees and expenses, will accrue daily.  The amount of net interest
income which accrues per unit may


-17-





change as securities mature or are redeemed, exchanged or sold, or as the
expenses of a trust change or the number of outstanding units of a trust
changes.


Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.


ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest consists of two elements.  The first
element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of
unpaid interest on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was
paid.  Interest on securities generally is paid monthly or semi-annually
although a trust accrues such interest daily.  Because of this, a trust always
has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee.  For this
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date,
the public offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.


In an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to
the public, the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the
first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the
unitholder of record as of the first settlement date.  Consequently, the amount
of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will
include only accrued interest arising after the first settlement date to the
date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent
to the first settlement date.


The second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of
the Interest Account.  The trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders
until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust.  The trustee is
obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in order to advanced interest
distributions.  The trustee will recover these advancements when such interest
is received.  Interest Account balances are established to limit the extent to
which it may be necessary for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection
with such interest distributions.  The Interest Account balances are also
structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances.


Because of the varying interest payment dates of securities, accrued
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest
actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders.
Therefore, there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to
the value of the units.  If a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of
his units, he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued
interest from the purchaser of his units.  Since the trustee has the use of the
funds held in the Interest Account for distributions to unitholders and since
such account is non-interest-bearing to unitholders, the trustee benefits
thereby.


COMPARISON OF PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND REDEMPTION PRICE.  While the net
asset value of units during the initial offering period will generally be
determined on the basis of the current


-18-





offering prices of the securities in a trust, after the initial offering period
the net asset value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the
current bid prices of the securities.  As of the close of business on the
business day before the trust's inception date, the public offering price per
unit exceeded the redemption price at which units could have been redeemed by
the amount of the sales fee.  The bid prices for on securities similar to those
in the trust are lower than the offering prices thereof.  For this reason, among
others (including fluctuations in the market prices of the securities and the
fact that the public offering price includes a sales fee), the amount realized
by a unitholder upon any redemption of units may be less than the price paid for
such units.


PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and through others.  Sales
may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the
public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial banks
may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not
change the price you pay for your units.


The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.


PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the
cost of such securities to a trust, which is based on the offering side
evaluation of the securities.  The sponsor may also realize profits or losses
with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.


MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said
units at the net asset value, determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate
bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust, together with any accrued
interest to the expected dates of settlement, provided that the repurchase price
will


-19-





not be reduced by any remaining creation and development fee or organization
costs during the initial offering period.  While the sponsor may repurchase
units from time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain an active
secondary market for units.  To the extent that a market is maintained during
the initial offering period, the prices at which units will be repurchased will
be based upon the aggregate offering side evaluation of the securities in the
trust.  The aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in each trust are
expected to be less than the related aggregate offering prices (which is
generally the evaluation method used during the initial public offering period).
Accordingly, unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of
their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is
in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and, if so, the amount
thereof.


The offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord
with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units.
Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the
sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market, it may suspend
or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds
demand, or for other business reasons.


REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office.
Unitholders must sign the request exactly as their names appear on the records
of the trustee.  If the amount of the redemption is $500 or less and the
proceeds are payable to the unitholder(s) of record at the address of record, no
signature guarantee is necessary for redemptions by individual account owners
(including joint owners).  Additional documentation may be requested, and a
signature guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors,
administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program
("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.


Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing
redemption requests.


Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances the
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,
such unitholder should make sure that


-20-





the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to
avoid this possible "back-up withholding." In the event the trustee has not been
previously provided such number, one must be provided at the time redemption is
requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption representing interest shall be
withdrawn from the Interest Account of a trust to the extent that funds are
available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on redemption shall be
withdrawn from the Principal Account for a trust.


The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold,
the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced but
each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same
proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a time when
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be more or less
than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities
in the portfolio at the time of redemption.


The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of
the redemption price.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;

(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.


COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units (the net
asset value) of each trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation
time stated in the prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for
redemption and on any other business day desired by it, by:


A.   adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in
the trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such
securities; (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities
(including "when issued" contracts, if any) held in the trust as
determined by the evaluator on the basis of bid prices therefor; and

(3) interest accrued and unpaid on the securities in the trust as of the
date of computation;


-21-





B.   deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or
governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve
Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses of the
trust, including but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee
(including legal and auditing fees and any insurance costs), the evaluator,
the sponsor and bond counsel, if any; (3) cash held for distribution to
unitholders of record as of the business day prior to the evaluation being
made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the trust, provided that the
redemption price will not be reduced by any creation and development fee or
organization costs during the initial offering period; and


C.   finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.


RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust may lower the
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts. Fees and charges with respect
to such plans may vary.


OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by
certificates.  Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any
multiple thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement.  Fractions of
units, if any, will be computed to three decimal places.



TAXATION



The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S.
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.


The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.


If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to
comply with applicable distribution


-22-





requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital
gains distributed to its unitholders.


To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,

(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year,

(i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is represented by
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net short-
term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes net
capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income
each taxable year.


As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October,


-23-





November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust
during January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be
taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are
declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.


If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.



PERFORMANCE INFORMATION



INTEREST, ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RETURN AND ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN.  As of
the close of business on the business day before the trust's inception date, the
estimated long-term return and the estimated current return, if applicable, for
each trust were as set forth in the "Essential Information" for each trust in
the prospectus.  Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the current
estimated net annual interest income per unit based on the interest rates
currently applicable to the bonds by the public offering price.  The estimated
net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates
applicable to the bonds (some of which may be subject to adjustments related to
changes in the bonds' ratings as provided by certain ratings services) fees and
expenses of the trustee, the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal
prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of the securities while the
public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the
underlying securities and accrued interest; therefore, there is no assurance
that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future.
Estimated long-term return is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into
consideration, and determines and factors in the relative weightings of, the
market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements or average life of all of
the securities in a trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales fee
associated with each trust unit.  Since the interest rates, market values and
estimated retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust may change,
there is no assurance that the present estimated long-term return will be
realized in the future.  Estimated current return and estimated long-term return
are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated long-term return
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated
current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public
offering price.


GENERAL.  Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the
prospectus, as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included
from time to time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information
on the performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may
be included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and
may reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund
Watch (which rates fund performance over a


-24-





specified time period after sales fee and assuming all dividends reinvested) or
Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service (which states fund performance
annually on a total return basis) or of the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index, the American Stock Exchange Index (unmanaged indices of stocks traded on
the New York and American Stock Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (an index of 30 widely traded industrial common stocks) or
the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks)
or similar measurement standards during the same period of time.



DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS



STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &
Poor's issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an
obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of
financial obligations, or a specific financial program (including ratings on
medium-term note programs and commercial paper programs). It takes into
consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of
credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in
which the obligation is denominated. The issue credit rating is not a
recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold a financial obligation, inasmuch as it
does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


Issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the
obligors or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers
reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any
credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.
Credit ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn as a result of changes
in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other circumstances.


Issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the
relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper. Short-
term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with
respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual rating,
in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the
usual long-term rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.



Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings



Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


*  Likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its
financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the
obligation;


*  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


*  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the
event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of
bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


-25-





The issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to
a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.



BB, B, CCC, CC, and C



Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC', and 'C' are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of
speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.


B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.


CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.


-26-





C--A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently
highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation
where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but payments
on this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a
preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments, but that
is currently paying.


D--An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is
used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.


Plus (+) or minus (-)--The ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the
addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the
major rating categories.


N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.



Active Qualifiers (Currently applied and/or outstanding)



i--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, terms, or
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood
of receipt of principal on the obligation. The 'i' subscript indicates that the
rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only. The 'i' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'p' subscript, which addresses
likelihood of receipt of principal. For example, a rated obligation could be
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.


L--Ratings qualified with 'L' apply only to amounts invested up to federal
deposit insurance limits.


p--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, the terms, or
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood
of receipt of interest on the obligation. The 'p' subscript indicates that the
rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only. The 'p' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'i' subscript, which addresses
likelihood of receipt of interest. For example, a rated obligation could be
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.


pi--Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are based on an analysis of an issuer's
published financial information, as well as additional information in the public
domain. They do not, however, reflect in-depth meetings with an issuer's
management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than
ratings without a 'pi' subscript. Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are reviewed
annually based on a new year's financial statements, but may be reviewed on an
interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuer's credit
quality.


-27-





pr--The letters 'pr' indicate that the rating is provisional. A provisional
rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt
being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely
or entirely dependent upon the successful, timely completion of the project.
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion
of the project, makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default
upon failure of such completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment
with respect to such likelihood and risk.


t--This symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their
contracts to full maturity or, should certain events occur, to terminate and
cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date.



MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. Long-Term Obligation Ratings



Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit
risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more.
They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as
promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial
loss suffered in the event of default.



Long-Term Rating Definitions:



Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal
credit risk.


Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.


A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low
credit risk.


Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.


Ba--Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject
to substantial credit risk.


B--Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit
risk.


Caa--Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to
very high credit risk.


Ca--Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near,
default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.


C--Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in
default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation
ranks in the higher end of its generic


-28-





rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier
3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.



FITCH RATINGS LTD., International Long-Term Credit Ratings



A Fitch International Long-Term Credit Ratings ("LTCR") may also be
referred to as long-term ratings. When assigned to most issuers, it is used as a
benchmark measure of probability of default and is formally described as an
issuer default rating ("IDR"). The major exception is within public finance,
where IDRs will not be assigned as market convention has always focused on
timeliness and does not draw analytical distinctions between issuers and their
underlying obligations. When applied to issues or securities, the LTCR may be
higher or lower than the IDR to reflect relative differences in recovery
expectations.  The following rating scale applies to foreign currency and local
currency ratings:



Investment Grade Ratings



AAA--Highest credit quality. "AAA" ratings denote the lowest expectation of
credit risk. They are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for
payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be
adversely affected by foreseeable events.


AA--Very high credit quality. "AA" ratings denote expectations of very low
credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial
commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable
events.


A--High credit quality. "A" ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The
capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This
capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in
economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.


BBB--Good credit quality. "BBB" ratings indicate that there are currently
expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial
commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and
economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity.  This is the lowest
investment grade category.



Speculative Grade



BB--Speculative. "BB" ratings indicate that there is a possibility of credit
risk developing, particularly as the result of adverse economic change over
time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow
financial commitments to be met. Securities rated in this category are not
investment grade.


B--Highly speculative.  For issuers and performing obligations, "B" ratings
indicate that significant credit risk is present, but a limited margin of safety
remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; however, capacity for
continued payment is contingent upon a sustained, favorable business and
economic environment.  For individual obligations, may indicate


-29-





distressed or defaulted obligations with potential for extremely high
recoveries. Such obligations would possess a Recovery Rating of "RR1"
(outstanding).


CCC--For issuers and performing obligations, default is a real possibility.
Capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained,
favorable business or economic conditions.  For individual obligations, may
indicate distressed or defaulted obligations with potential for average to
superior levels of recovery. Differences in credit quality may be denoted by
plus/minus distinctions. Such obligations typically would possess a Recovery
Rating of "RR2" (superior), "RR3" (good) or "RR4" (average).


CC--For issuers and performing obligations, default of some kind appears
probable.  For individual obligations, may indicate distressed or defaulted
obligations with a Recovery Rating of "RR4" (average) or "RR5" (below average).


C--For issuers and performing obligations, default is imminent.  For individual
obligations, may indicate distressed or defaulted obligations with potential for
below-average to poor recoveries. Such obligations would possess a Recovery
Rating of "RR6" (poor).


RD--Indicates an entity that has failed to make due payments (within the
applicable grace period) on some but not all material financial obligations, but
continues to honor other classes of obligations. .


D--Indicates an entity or sovereign that has defaulted on all of its financial
obligations. Default generally is defined as one of the following:  a)  failure
of an obligor to make timely payment of principal and/or interest under the
contractual terms of any financial obligation;  b) the bankruptcy filings,
administration, receivership, liquidation or other winding-up or cessation of
business of an obligor; or c) the distressed or other coercive exchange of an
obligation, where creditors were offered securities with diminished structural
or economic terms compared with the existing obligation.  Default ratings are
not assigned prospectively; within this context, non-payment on an instrument
that contains a deferral feature or grace period will not be considered a
default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period.


Issuers will be rated "D" upon a default.  Defaulted and distressed
obligations typically are rated along the continuum of "C" to "B" ratings
categories, depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant
characteristics. Additionally, in structured finance transactions, where
analysis indicates that an instrument is irrevocably impaired such that it is
not expected to meet pay interest and/or principal in full in accordance with
the terms of the obligation's documentation during the life of the transaction,
but where no payment default in accordance with the terms of the documentation
is imminent, the obligation may be rated in the "B" or "CCC-C" categories.
Default is determined by reference to the terms of the obligations'
documentation. Fitch will assign default ratings where it has reasonably
determined that payment has not been made on a material obligation in accordance
with the requirements of the obligation's documentation, or where it believes
that default ratings consistent with Fitch's published definition of default are
the most appropriate ratings to assign.


-30-





Note:  The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to denote
relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to
the "AAA" Long-term rating category, to categories below "CCC", or to Short-term
ratings other than "F1". (The +/- modifiers are only used to denote issues
within the CCC category, whereas issuers are only rated CCC without the use of
modifiers.)
