STAY CONNECTED, EVEN WHEN YOU’RE OUT OF SIGHT
LONG-RANGE MUSIC SHARING AND INTERCOM FOR MOTORCYCLISTS




GO THE DISTANCE—UP TO 900 METERS
For sharing music, and conversation
The SMH10 motorcycle intercom and headset was designed to keep you connected to your riding companions over longer ranges for conversation and Bluetooth music sharing—up to 900 meters (980 yards). When paired with a Bluetooth®-enabled phone, it’ll also let you make hands-free calls.










Designed for easy operation
Jog Dial makes it easy to control while riding
The SMH10 features a Helmet Clamp Kit and Boom Microphone. The Jog Dial, meanwhile, makes for an intuitive user interface that is much easier to control while riding. The Jog Dial default is volume control, and pushing the integrated button lets you cycle through all device functions with minimal fuss, which means you’ll ride safer. Few headsets for motorcycle riding offer such a simple user experience.




ALL THE FUN, IN CRYSTAL CLARITY
Powered by Bluetooth 3.0
Bluetooth 3.0 technology provides the capability to listen to and share music, make phone calls with speed dialing, and participate in a four-way intercom conversation with riding buddies up to 900 meters (980 yards) away from each other.










Outstanding sound quality with Advanced Noise Control™
For both incoming and outgoing audio
The SMH10 delivers crystal-clear, natural sound through the stereo Bluetooth® headset that gets an automatic boost in noisy environments while Advanced Noise Control™ technology cuts down on background noise for both incoming and outgoing audio. The Bluetooth music playback control features play, pause, track forward and track back functions, plus each audio source has its own adjustable volume level.




Optimized for life, simple to learn
Free firmware updates for life, easy-to-follow voice prompts
All registered Sena owners get access to free firmware upgrades, which ensure your SMH10 headset and intercom for motorcycle helmets is always operating with the latest software updates. Meanwhile, integrated voice prompts (available in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish) help you quickly learn your way around the device. You’ll get up to 12 hours of talk time and 10 days of stand-by time on a single charge.










Share the experience, Share the ride
Cross-brand intercom compatibility
Even if your companions don’t have Sena gear, the SMH10 uses the Universal Intercom™ protocol, which allows your gear to work with theirs, regardless of brand.
