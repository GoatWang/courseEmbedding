About Us

EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by EQT Corporation to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. EQM provides substantially all of its natural gas gathering, transmission and storage services under contracts with long-term, firm reservation and/or usage fees. This contract structure enhances the stability of EQM’s cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.
 
 
 
EQM’s operations are primarily focused in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia, a strategic location in the natural gas shale plays known as the Marcellus, Upper Devonian, and Utica Shales. This same region is also the core operating area of EQT, EQM’s largest customer that accounted for approximately 75% of EQM’s revenues generated for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
 
 
EQM provides midstream services to EQT and multiple third parties across 24 counties in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio through its two primary assets: the gathering system, which delivers natural gas from wells and other receipt points to transmission pipelines, and the transmission and storage system, which serves as a header system transmission pipeline. EQM believes that its strategically located assets, combined with its working relationship with EQT, position it as a leading Appalachian Basin midstream energy company.
 
 
 
The principal business objective for EQT Midstream Partners is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that it pays to our unitholders over time, while ensuring the ongoing stability of its business. EQM intends to achieve this objective by capitalizing on economically attractive organic growth opportunities; increasing access to existing and new delivery markets; attracting additional third party volumes; and focusing on stable, fixed-fee business.




EQT GP Holdings, LP  (EQGP)is a limited partnership formed by EQT in 2015 to own EQT's partnership interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP. EQT is the ultimate parent company of EQGP and EQM. EQGP’s only cash-generating assets are its partnership interests in EQM, comprised of a 26.6% limited partner interest, a 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights in EQM. As of December 31, 2016, EQT owned a 90.1% limited partner interest in EQGP and 100% of the non-economic general partner interest in EQGP.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
