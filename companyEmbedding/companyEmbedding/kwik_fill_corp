We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation is the oldest and one of the most common business structures, and is typically what comes to mind when the average person hears the word "corporation". It provides the greatest level of separation and protection between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?One of the C Corporation's greatest strengths as a structure is that it typically has no requirements regarding who can become part of its ownership. However, a few states do require that an individual be at least 18 years of age to officially become an owner. What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?C Corporations and their owners are taxed separately from one another, which results in "double taxation". This means that the corporation will be taxed on its profits and then each individual owner will be taxed again on the income distributed to them at a personal level. Filing as an S corp can help business owners avoid this, but will also open them up to paying self-employment taxes. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS.

KWIKPAY POLICY STATEMENTRead the Kwik Pay Policy Statement and click the button below

United Refining Company and its affiliated companies ("United") appreciate your visiting this Web site and other related or linked United sites (the "Site").  We value your privacy and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from visitors to the Site and with respect to how that information may be used.  Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit.  Certain portions or pages of the Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or page; for example, certain applications may request additional information.
Information and Uses
When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the Site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit.  We also track such information as the number of visits to the Site, which parts of the Site visitors select, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type, browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), date and time of day.  We use those types of information for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the Site. Those types of information do not disclose personal information that would permit us to identify or locate individual visitors.
Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information ("PI"), that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers.  If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with PI.  We may collect and use that PI to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to market products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes.  PI may also be used to manage and provide training and to obtain course assessments and self-assessments concerning skill and competencies from participants in order to identify and enhance training activities.
As explained below in the section on Sharing Information with Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell PI to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/ Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your PI from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us.  If you notify us that PI previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections.  To facilitate our efforts, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provide PI, e.g. in connection with promotion of a specific product or service.

Information Placed on Your Computer
We may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer when you look at or use the Site.  This information facilitates customizing your use of the Site and ensures that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you visit it.  You can erase or block this information from your computer if you want to. (Your ‘help' screen or user manual should tell you how to do this.)
We use third-party advertising technology to provide ads when you visit sites upon which we advertise.  This technology will not process any information that can be used to personally identify you, that is it will not include your name, address, or other PI.  When you access an ad, a "cookie" file will be stored on your computer.  This information is used to help manage our on-line advertising.
Information from Children
The Site may have information that may be of special interest to children but United does not seek through the Site to gather PI from or about persons under the age of 17.
Hyperlinks
This Site may have links to sites that United does not own, control or maintain.  We make no representations or warranties about privacy practices of linked sites and cannot be responsible for their privacy policies and practices and we make no representations or warranties about the privacy practices of those sites.  Similarly, we cannot be responsible for the policies and practices of any site from which you linked to our Web site.  We recommend that you check the privacy policy of other sites and contact the operator if you have concerns or questions.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
Communicating via the Internet and sending information, products, and services to you by other means necessarily involves your PI passing through or being handled by third-parties, but United does not sell or distribute your PI to third parties for purposes of allowing them to market their products and services to you.
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include fulfilling order, deliveries, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing date, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service.  They have access to PI needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Personal data collected by United may be transferred among its various divisions and affiliated companies.  By submitting data on the Site, the visitor is providing explicit consent to these transfers.
Sensitive Information
United does not seek any sensitive information from visitors to our Site, unless legally required to do so, for example in connection with processing credit card payments, recruiting and hiring.  Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating, but not limited to: race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, or criminal record, We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature.  However, if you do provide such information, United accepts your explicit consent to use that data in the ways described in this Privacy Statement or in the ways described at the point where such information is disclosed.
Opt Out/Modify Information
You can request the removal or modification of your PI by sending an e-mail to the appropriate area under "Contact Us".  We will then make a reasonable effort to accommodate your request.  As previously noted, it would be helpful to let us know the context in which you provided PI.
Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions
If you choose to visit our Site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Statement and our general Conditions of Use, including any limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes and application of law provisions.  We reserve the right to change this statement at any time without notice except as otherwise provided herein.
Contacting United Customer Relations
If you have any questions about the content of this Privacy Statement, please refer to the contact page on this site or write United's headquarters at the following address:
United Refining Company
							15 Bradley Street
							Warren, Pennsylvania 16365
							ATTN: Customer Relations Dept.
When we make material changes to this Privacy Statement, we will post the changes on this page and update the revision date at the top of the Privacy Statement.  We encourage you to visit our Privacy Statement regularly for updates.

History[edit]

Kwik Fill sign, January 2013


The United Refining Company was founded in 1902 by Harry Logan, Sr. His son, Harry Logan, Jr., succeeded his father as president and chairman of United Refining in 1957. In 1981, John Catsimatidis acquired United Refining as a subsidiary of his Red Apple Group.
The refinery was expanded from 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 m3/d) to 65,000 barrels per day (10,300 m3/d) in 1982. It was expanded again to have a processing capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (11,000 m3/d) in 2007. The employees of the Warren refinery are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
Citgo[edit]
United Refining acquired the rights to use the name Citgo in 2002 when it bought a local gas station and convenience store chain called Country Fair, Inc. in Erie, Pennsylvania[3] which included a license agreement to use "Citgo's brands, trademarks and other forms of identification."[4]
After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's speech to the United Nations, there were calls to boycott the Citgo brand.[4] In response, URC began phasing out that brandname,[4] and has been emphasizing that its crude oil supply comes from North America. URC also continued rebranding its product under the Kwik Fill and other local names.[5]
Alternate energy[edit]
United Refining blends ethanol with its gasoline in accordance with the Energy Policy Act.
Convenience stores[edit]
United Refining Company distributes its oil through its line of owned-and-operated convenience stores, totaling approximately 375 throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Northeast Ohio. The stores operate under the names Kwik Fill, Red Apple, or Country Fair. Many Kwik Fill locations, like the one in the photo above, are full-service, meaning they pump your gas for you.

History[edit]




URC fuel truck in Pennsylvania with "North American oil" logo






Kwik Fill sign, January 2013


The United Refining Company was founded in 1902 by Harry Logan, Sr. His son, Harry Logan, Jr., succeeded his father as president and chairman of United Refining in 1957. In 1981, John Catsimatidis acquired United Refining as a subsidiary of his Red Apple Group.
The refinery was expanded from 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 m3/d) to 65,000 barrels per day (10,300 m3/d) in 1982. It was expanded again to have a processing capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (11,000 m3/d) in 2007. The employees of the Warren refinery are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
Citgo[edit]
United Refining acquired the rights to use the name Citgo in 2002 when it bought a local gas station and convenience store chain called Country Fair, Inc. in Erie, Pennsylvania[3] which included a license agreement to use "Citgo's brands, trademarks and other forms of identification."[4]
After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's speech to the United Nations, there were calls to boycott the Citgo brand.[4] In response, URC began phasing out that brandname,[4] and has been emphasizing that its crude oil supply comes from North America. URC also continued rebranding its product under the Kwik Fill and other local names.[5]
Alternate energy[edit]
United Refining blends ethanol with its gasoline in accordance with the Energy Policy Act.
Convenience stores[edit]
United Refining Company distributes its oil through its line of owned-and-operated convenience stores, totaling approximately 375 throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Northeast Ohio. The stores operate under the names Kwik Fill, Red Apple, or Country Fair. Many Kwik Fill locations, like the one in the photo above, are full-service, meaning they pump your gas for you.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation is the oldest and one of the most common business structures, and is typically what comes to mind when the average person hears the word "corporation". It provides the greatest level of separation and protection between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?One of the C Corporation's greatest strengths as a structure is that it typically has no requirements regarding who can become part of its ownership. However, a few states do require that an individual be at least 18 years of age to officially become an owner. What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?C Corporations and their owners are taxed separately from one another, which results in "double taxation". This means that the corporation will be taxed on its profits and then each individual owner will be taxed again on the income distributed to them at a personal level. Filing as an S corp can help business owners avoid this, but will also open them up to paying self-employment taxes. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.
