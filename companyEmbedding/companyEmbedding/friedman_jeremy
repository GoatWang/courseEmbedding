Schoology is a learning management system (LMS) for K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and corporations that allows users to create, manage, and share content and resources. Also known as a course management system (CMS) or virtual learning environment (VLE), the cloud-based platform provides tools to manage any classroom or blended learning environment.[1]

Background[edit]
The Schoology platform was designed by Jeremy Friedman, Ryan Hwang and Tim Trinidad in [2] 2007 while still undergraduates at Washington University in St. Louis, MO. Originally designed for sharing notes, additional features and functionality continue to be added.[3]
Schoology secured its first institutional round of venture capital funding amounting to $1.25M from Meakam Becker Venture Capital in June 2010, following an angel investment in 2009 from an unnamed investor.[4] In 2012, Schoology raised [5]$6M in a round led by Firstmark Capital, and in 2014, a [6]$15M round of funding was led by Intel Capital.
As of November 2014, Schoology has over 9.5 million users across 100,000 schools in 200 countries around the world.[7]
In November 2015, Schoology announced its $32 million Series D funding round, led by JMI Equity.[8]
Product[edit]
Visually familiar to users of Facebook[1] and other popular social networking websites, the service includes attendance records, online gradebook, tests and quizzes, and homework dropboxes. The social media interface facilitates collaboration among a class, a group, or a school.[3] Schoology can be integrated with existing school reporting and information systems[4] and also provides the added security, filters and support that school districts may require.[4]
Schoology is offered to educators free of charge. Revenue is generated with a fee-based Enterprise product that includes premium add-ons such as customized branding, advanced analytics, single sign on (SSO), and data integration with existing student information systems (SIS).[9] Native mobile applications are available for iOS, Android, and Kindle devices.
Product enhancements have included text message notifications, integrations with Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote, IMS Global learning tools interoperability (LTI), educational and non-educational apps,[10] a shared resources library, mastery analytics and a question importer for tests and quizzes.
Users include [11] San Juan USD,[12]Colorado State University-Global Campus,[13]Department of Defense Education Activity,[14] Uruguay's Plan Ceibal,[15] Greenwich Public Schools,[16]Judson Independent School District, Westminster Christian Academy,[17]Palo Alto Unified School District,[18] Cempaka Schools in Malaysia,[19] the Downingtown STEM Academy, Rocklin Unified School District, San Diego Unified School District, Jefferson County School District, Cincinnati Public Schools,[20] Cabarrus County Schools, Los Angeles Unified School District & Australian Christian College (for both On campus & Distance Education students).

Leveraging state-of-the-art LEAN practices, Six Sigma, key investments in infrastructure and FlexQ, a propriety quality program that is beyond leading edge according to customers, Flextronics is the market leader in almost every business in which it operates. Whether high mix/low volume or low mix/high volume, Flextronics can enable any customer's success.

Jeremy Friedman is an assistant professor of business administration in the Business, Government, and International Economy Unit, and teaches the course of the same name in the MBA required curriculum. Previously, he was associate director of the Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy at Yale University.
Professor Friedman studies the history of communism, socialism, and revolution in Russia, China, and the developing world. He examines how the project of socialist revolution and leftist thought more broadly evolved over the course of the twentieth century, particularly as revolutionary battlegrounds shifted from the industrialized countries to the developing world in the wake of decolonization. His work has been published in Cold War History and Modern China Studies and in media outlets including The National Interest, The Diplomat, and The Moscow Times. His first book, Shadow Cold War: The Sino-Soviet Competition for the Third World, was published in 2015.
Professor Friedman received his PhD in history from Princeton University and subsequently held a postdoctoral fellowship in international security studies at Yale University, where he taught courses in Russian and Cold War history.Print Entire ProfileLess










Shadow Cold War: The Sino-Soviet Competition for the Third World 
The conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War has long been understood in a global context, but Jeremy Friedman's Shadow Cold War delves deeper into the era to examine the competition between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China for the leadership of the world revolution. When a world of newly independent states emerged from decolonization desperately poor and politically disorganized, Moscow and Beijing turned their focus to attracting these new entities, setting the stage for Sino-Soviet competition. Based on archival research from ten countries, including new materials from Russia and China, many no longer accessible to researchers, this book examines how China sought to mobilize Asia, Africa, and Latin America to seize the revolutionary mantle from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union adapted to win it back, transforming the nature of socialist revolution in the process. This groundbreaking book is the first to explore the significance of this second Cold War that China and the Soviet Union fought in the shadow of the capitalist-communist clash.

Free at Last, Now What: The Soviet and Chinese Attempts to Offer a Roadmap for the Post-Colonial World
Jeremy Friedman
This article seeks to understand the motivations behind the People's Republic of China's attempt to present an alternative development model for the post-colonial world and challenge Soviet leadership in the international communist movement in mid-1960s. When the wave of post-war decolonization crested in Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s, inaugurating dozens of new states desperate for a political and economic model that would put flesh on the bones of independence, the USA and USSR were eager to offer aid and advice to promote their own models. The PRC, suffering the consequences of a century-long tangle with imperialism and decades of war coupled with the effects of the Great Leap Forward, was in a distinctly disadvantageous position to compete with the two superpowers. However, it did compete, and the question is why. The existing historiography on the Sino-Soviet split focuses on Mao's desire for leadership of the international communist movement, his contempt for Khrushchev, and his battle for control of the Chinese Communist Party line. This tends to render the Chinese as the unpredictable aggressor and the Soviets as playing a reactive game. This article argues instead that the timing and nature of the Chinese challenge reflect the reactive elements in the PRC's own policy, which was formulated largely in response to a perceived security threat resulting from the Soviet policy of "Peaceful Coexistence" as well as Soviet misunderstanding and neglect of the anti-colonial revolution.

Research Summary




			Research Summary        
		


Overview
by 
		
		
        Jeremy S. Friedman
	
Professor Friedman devotes his research to the history of the Left and its struggle to end economic and social inequality. He studies how this struggle evolved, its various cultural contexts, and what paths have been tried and rejected. He has been able to gain access to archival resources, some no longer available to researchers, and to study them in their original languages.

In his first book, Shadow Cold War: The Sino-Soviet Competition for the Third World, Professor Friedman examines the different approaches taken by the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China in their quest for influence in newly decolonized Third World states after World War II. He is currently investigating how socialism played itself out in the political trajectories of five of these countries—Indonesia, Tanzania, Chile, Angola, and Iran—from the late 1940s to the 1980s. He explores the process by which actors in these countries, as well as in the Soviet Union and China, attempted to create a workable model of socialism for the developing world. In this environment, no one knew what “Third World Socialism” should look like, so the lessons of each attempt to build it were studied and absorbed into the next one.
