NET CONTENTS: ﻿ 1 g poly(acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine/amber glass bottle
DESCRIPTIONDerived from chitin obtained from Arctic shrimp shells, Synoplex® has an approximate molecular weight of 20 to 100 kDa. Each gram of Synoplex® contains 1 gram of poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine. Synoplex® is supplied as a dry soluble powder, that is rehydrated with sterile water prior to use.

    (click image for full-size original) INDICATION


For topical application on animals in the family Elephantidae and Rhinocerotidae for treatment of foot and dermal lesions infected with aerobic or facultative anaerobic Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria; and for treatment of sterile chronic foot and dermal lesions.
  ﻿FOR USE IN ANIMALS IN THE FAMILY ELEPHANTIDAE AND RHINOCEROTIDAE ONLY; THIS PRODUCT IS NOT TO BE USED IN ANIMALS INTENDED FOR USE AS FOOD FOR HUMANS OR OTHER ANIMALS.  
WARNINGNot for use in humans.  Keep out of the reach of children. In case of skin, eye contact, or ingestion, flush affected area with water.  If inhalation occurs and breathing becomes difficult, move to fresh air, and contact a physician.
OTHER HEALTH INFORMATIONPoly (acetyl) glucosamine can be characterized as biologically safe, nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide.  The publicly available toxicology and safety data adequately support the safety of poly (acetyl) glucosamine in terms of general toxicity in animals and in vitro and local tolerance studies.  A series of general toxicology tests were also conducted to provide additional assurance that poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine did not show differences from the safety profile of poly (acetyl) glucosamine.  The results from these studies in rodents showed no test article-related changes in hematology or clinical chemistry, and no microscopic lesions associated with administration of poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine.  in a L5178Y TK +/- mouse lymphoma forward mutation screen, poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine was also negative for induction of mutagenic activity after treatment for 4 hours with and without S9, and for 24 hours without S9.
To obtain a Material Safety Data Sheet, call Synedgen, Inc. at (909) 447-6858.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONSynoplex® is supplied as a dry soluble powder, needing to be rehydrated with sterile water prior to use.  Wear gloves during handling and use of Synoplex®.  Determine the amount of Synoplex® powder needed to achieve the desired concentration for the intended use.  Dissolve Synoplex® in a known volume of sterile water and mix well. Before applying rinse treatment, ensure that the lesion is properly debrided.
CLEANLINESSIt is recommended that application vessels
should be clean prior to use.
DOSEA general dose of Synoplex® for infected wounds is 500μg/mL and for non-infected wounds is 200μg/mL in a volume sufficient to moisten the affected area. The frequency of application should be 1-2 times per day until the lesion is resolved. Synoplex® should always be used in conjunction with good wound care consisting of initial debridement to remove all necrotic and/or infected tissue.
DOSE CALCULATIONThe possible doses are calculated below.
     Synoplex Powder  Synoplex Dosage  Amount of Sterile Water    Example:  1)  1g                     X  200 µg/mL           =  5L    Example:  2)  1g                     X  500 µg/mL           =  2L   PRECAUTIONSynoplex® efficacy against Mycobacteria sp. has not been demonstrated.
