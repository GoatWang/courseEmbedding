President & CEO of Seventh Generation Inc., Former President & CEO of Burt's Bees, 




John Replogle (rep-luh-gul) joined Seventh Generation in March of 2011. He is the former President & CEO of Burt’s Bees, the leading Earth-friendly, natural personal care products company. Prior to Burt’s Bees, John spent three years at Unilever, where he managed the skin care division and helped to launch the Real Beauty campaign for Dove and establish the Dove Self-Esteem Fund.
John’s commitment to conscious consumerism and the triple bottom line factored heavily into his decision to join the Seventh Generation team.
An avid outdoorsman, John will be right at home among the lakes, hills, and hiking trails of the Green Mountain State.  In fact, his new role at Seventh Generation marks a return to his New England roots where he was raised and educated—first at Dartmouth College, where he earned a B.A. in History, and later, as an MBA student and graduate of Harvard Business School.
A father of four, John and his wife Kristin count Seventh Generation liquid laundry detergent among their favorite products.
John Replogle joined Burt's Bees in 2006 to oversee all activities and set the tone and direction for the company. He came from Unilever, where he ran the skin care division and helped to launch the Real Beauty campaign for Dove and establish the Dove Self-Esteem Fund for young girls. John's love for our products and his family both played a role in his decision to come on board. He has four daughters and says "Raising their awareness to environmental and natural product consciousness provides a very tangible benefit in my life. I just feel like this is a place where I can be my best, do great work and do some good in the process." John earned a B.A. in History from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. His upbringing in New England gave him a great appreciation for the ocean and mountains and helped him to become an avid outdoorsman. Put him on a bike, in a canoe or on a hiking trail and he couldn't be happier.
John Replogle was named Chief Executive Officer and President of Burt's Bees on January 19, 2006. The appointment is effective January 19, 2006.
Replogle previously spent three years at Unilever as General Manager, Skin Care, North America. He also served on the company's Operating Executive Committee and Global Category Board. His leadership was marked by successful efforts to improve the division's innovation, recraft their marketing and build a strong leadership team.

Transforming Commerce 

 Seventh Generation 



For more than 25 years we’ve been formulating plant-based products that are safe and that work. Really well. Based in Vermont, we’re proud to be a B Corporation. B Corps are certified to be better for workers, better for communities and better for the environment. Join us in nurturing the health of the next seven generations.
Making A Difference
We believe our products are healthy solutions for the air, surfaces, fabrics, pets and people within your home–and for the community and environment outside of it. As a pioneer in corporate responsibility, we want our products to make a difference—from their development through to their production, purchase, use, and disposal.  We are always evaluating how to reduce their environmental impact, increase performance and safety, and create a more sustainable supply chain. We believe it is our responsibility to set a course for a more mindful way of doing business, where companies act as partners with other stakeholders to create a brighter future for the whole planet.
Our Leadership

John Replogle, President & CEO
John Replogle (rep-luh-gul) joined Seventh Generation in March of 2011. He comes to us from Burt’s Bees, the leading Earth-friendly, natural personal care products company, where he served starting in January 2006 as President and Chief Executive Officer. Prior to Burt’s Bees, John spent three years at Unilever, where he managed the skin care division and helped to launch the Real Beauty campaign for Dove and establish the Dove Self-Esteem Fund.
John’s commitment to conscious consumerism and the triple bottom line factored heavily into his decision to join the Seventh Generation team.
“Business is one of the most powerful instruments for meaningful change on our planet.  I believe we’ve only just begun to explore the possibilities inherent in our products, our mission, and ourselves. It will be a privilege to build on Seventh Generation’s 23-year legacy and commitment to the Great Law of the Iroquois Confederacy:  In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.”
An avid outdoorsman, John will be right at home among the lakes, hills, and hiking trails of the Green Mountain State.  In fact, his new role at Seventh Generation marks a return to his New England roots where he was raised and educated—first at Dartmouth College, where he earned a B.A. in History, and later, as an MBA student and graduate of Harvard Business School.
A father of four, John and his wife Kristin count Seventh Generation liquid laundry detergent among their favorite products.

Overseers secure portal


Thayer School's Board of Overseers was established in 1867 by Sylvanus Thayer in his original "Instrument of Gift" founding the School which now bears his name. It was Thayer's intention that the School "be under the management and control of a Board of Overseers."
The members act on behalf of the Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College to:

Periodically assess the School's programs in light of the future needs of society and their relationship to the other academic activities of the College.
Review and approve, as advisory to the College's Board of Trustees, the Thayer School budget and its sources and applications of funds.
Review the adequacy of Thayer School academic programs and faculty resources in relation to the student population it seeks to enroll.
