	PRELIMINARY
	PROSPECTUS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED AUGUST ___, 2016




	ELITESOFT GLOBAL,
	INC.








	This is the initial
	offering of common stock of EliteSoft Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “our”), and no
	public market currently exists for the securities being offered herein as “Selling Shareholder” shares. We are offering
	for sale a total of 12,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.10 per share. We estimate our total offering registration
	costs to be approximately $15,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and
	the Selling Shareholders will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares.


	 


	The Selling Shareholders
	intend on selling their respective shares for the fixed price of $0.10 per share for the duration of the offering, after which,
	the Selling Shareholders may sell their shares at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices, including, but not limited
	to, transactions that may take place by ordinary broker's transactions, privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one
	or more dealers for resale. The Selling Shareholders are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The Selling Shareholders do not have
	a current arrangement or agreement with any underwriters, broker-dealers or selling agents for the sale of the shares subject to
	this Prospectus. If a Selling Shareholder enters into such an arrangement or agreement, the shares of such Selling Shareholder
	will be sold through such licensed underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling agent(s). No public market currently exists
	for the securities being offered. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that must be sold by us to proceed, and
	the Selling Shareholders will retain the proceeds from the sale of any shares of the common stock.

	We are an "emerging
	growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree
	of risk. You should purchase shares only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment. See "Prospectus Summary and
	Risk Factors" starting on page 7. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), nor any state
	securities commission, has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this Prospectus is truthful or complete.
	Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

	There has been no
	market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common
	stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of this Prospectus, we intend on
	having a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for our common
	stock to be eligible for trading on the appropriate United States trading exchange or market. We do not yet have a market maker
	who has agreed to file such an application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange
	or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.


	 


	Neither the SEC nor
	any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this
	Prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.
	Before buying any of our common stock, you should carefully read the discussion of material risks of investing in our common stock
	in the section titled "Risk Factors" in this Prospectus. The Selling Shareholders may use this Prospectus to offer the
	common stock from time to time.


	 


	As set forth in this
	Prospectus, we have previously issued common stock on a restricted basis to the Selling Shareholders identified herein in consideration
	of cash and assuming significant start-up expenses for the benefit of the company. For as long as this stock is “restricted”
	within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, we will, to the extent required, furnish to any shareholder, or
	to any prospective purchaser designated by such shareholder, upon request of such shareholder, financial and other information
	described in paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 144 with respect to the Company to the extent required in order to permit such shareholder
	to comply with Rule 144 with respect to any resale of their stock, unless during that time, we are subject to the reporting requirements
	of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act and no such
	information about the Company is otherwise required pursuant to Rule 144.


	 


	Until ninety business
	days after the effective date of this Prospectus, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities whether or not participating
	in this offering may be required to deliver a Prospectus. This is in addition to the dealer's obligation to deliver a Prospectus
	when acting as underwriters and with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.


	 


	This Prospectus
	is dated August ___, 2016

	You may only rely
	on the information contained in this Prospectus or that we have referred you to. We have not authorized anyone to provide you with
	different information. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities
	other than the Common Stock offered by this Prospectus. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation
	of an offer to buy any Common Stock in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. Neither the delivery
	of this Prospectus nor any sale made in connection with this Prospectus shall, under any circumstances, create any implication
	that there has been no change in our affairs since the date of this Prospectus or that the information contained by reference to
	this Prospectus is correct as of any time after its date. 



	 





	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY
	AND RISK FACTORS




	This Prospectus
	contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify
	forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans",
	"anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue"
	or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors," that may cause our
	or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.




	While these
	forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment
	regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions,
	projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
	laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual
	result

	s.



	Although
	management believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements included in this filing are reasonable, they
	do not guarantee our future performance, and actual results could differ from those contemplated by these forward looking statements.
	The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates
	of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances.
	As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions
	from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment.




	To the extent
	that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly,
	no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. In the light of these risks and uncertainties,
	there can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will
	in fact transpire. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their
	dates. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.




	Factors that might
	cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Risk Factors" contained
	in this report. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Prospectus will
	prove to be accurate. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements
	for any reason after the date of this report, to conform these statements to actual results, or to changes in our expectations.
	You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after
	the date of this statement.

	is more than 135 days after the end of your fiscal year.  Any and all amendments shall include updated interim or audited

	Corporate History



	 


	The Company’s
	predecessor-in-name - ANDES 3, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 23, 2014. On February 27, 2015, EliteSoft
	Asia Bhd Sdn (“Elite Soft Asia”) purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which constituted

	and the amendment to its articles of incorporation on March 16, 2015 changing the name of the Company to EliteSoft Global Inc.
	Elite Soft Asia is a related party and affiliate by virtue of the fact that it owns 2,000,000 shares, or 16.6%, of the Company’s

	We currently generate
	revenue by providing web and IT services for several clients. On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment Assumption
	Agreement with Elite Soft Asia (the “Assignment Agreement”). Under the Assignment Agreement, we acquired the NZ Financial
	Limited Technology Services Agreement (the “NZ Agreement”) from Elite Soft Asia in consideration for 2,000,000 shares
	of the Company’s restricted common stock. Under the NZ Agreement, we support NZ Financials’ initiatives in developing,
	designing, and maintaining its e-commerce website, create its corporate image, supply necessary computer hardware equipment, monitor
	server, and develop social media strategies. In exchange, NZ Financial pays the Company $2,000 per month. The NZ Agreement earned

	Industry, Competition,
	and Future Operations






	The IT web, System
	Integration and Application Solutions Industry



	 


	The IT web, systems
	integration and applications solutions market is a highly fragmented industry. There are numerous companies that have established
	businesses and command large market share, such as Accenture, BAE Systems, Cognizant Technology, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,
	Infosys, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Tata Consultancy that we compete against. We also compete with Alibaba, eBay, Amazon, Rakuten,
	Groupon, ASOS, Expedia and other e-commerce platform companies specifically in our e-commerce business in the Asia-Pacific region.
	Additionally, many of the vendor companies that the industry purchases products from may compete against their clients by offering
	full life cycle solutions and packages that support compatible software and hardware products, a role that IT web and system integrators
	normally play, therefore, emerging companies in our industry have taken to a full solution approach that offers clients a robust,
	'best of breed' and customized software programming with a higher emphasis on customer service relations. Additionally, in the
	Asia-Pacific markets, companies offer other options such as managing payroll, and accounting as well as recruitment and human resources
	on behalf of clients to further differentiate themselves from competitors. According to Transparency Market Research in 2014, the
	firm believes that the global market for system integration services was valued at $191.36 billion in 2013, and is expected to
	reach $377.59 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 10.9% during the period. Their assessment of
	the industry was that the Asia Pacific region was expected to be the fastest growing regional market for system integration, during
	the forecasted period. The rapidly growing economies of the Asia-Pacific region and globalization of firms are key drivers in propelling
	demand for the IT, system integration and services business.


	 


	Our company has developed
	a strategy that will encompass a broader approach to traditional IT web and system integration by focusing efforts on the emerging
	mobile payment industry. Our approach is to offer our clients full mobile payment integration with their IT strategy and developing
	a competitive mobile solution to their commerce needs. According to McKinsey, a global business consultancy firm, the Asia-Pacific
	region will account for more than 50% of the global payments growth over the next five years and cashless transactions will increase
	by more than 20% growth in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and China.


	 





	Competition



	 


	The mobile payments
	industry in the Asia-Pacific region is highly competitive. Given the outlook in the Asia-Pacific region, we believe that competition
	for revenues will intensify. In the mobile payments space, we compete with stand-alone players such as PayPal, Netteller, China
	Union Pay, AliPay, and BitPay, additionally, we compete with three categories of institutional players, Non-Bank payment companies,
	Asia-Pacific banks in home markets, and Banks in non-home markets.


	 








	-

	11

	-









	 








	Non-Bank payment companies
	are telecom or "telco" companies, that are seeking to expand their existing technologies by offering mobile payment solutions
	integrated into mobile phones and consumer machines such as ticketing services. Asia-Pacific banks are banks in home markets in
	Asia such as HSBC, Citi, and Standard Chartered. These banking institutions seek to increase their footprint with clients by offering
	mobile bank payment solutions in order to capture more revenue.



	Banks in non-home markets are banks outside the Asia-Pacific region that offer competitive services with the objective to increase
	cash management services through either low cost fees or no fee accounts. These banks are generally the least sophisticated members
	of the current competitive landscape based upon their inexperience in operating within the Asia-Pacific region, however, the amount
	of financial resources these banks control are formidable.



	 





	Employees



	 


	As of December 31,
	2015, we employed a total of three people. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be stable, and anticipates
	growing its workforce.


	 



	Facilities and
	Logistics



	 


	The Company maintains
	an office in Beaverton, Oregon, and its headquarters are in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our office in Beaverton is a 1,100 square foot

	office in Kuala Lumpur is a 2,000 square foot leased facility shared with EliteSoft Asia. We do not pay rent for this office. Our

	Jumpstart Our Business
	Startups (“JOBS”) Act



	 


	The disclosure contained
	below, discusses generally the terms of the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act”. In April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our
	Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:


	 


	Exemptions
	for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a
	new form of financing to small companies;


	 


	Amendments
	to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record
	holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;


	 


	Relaxation
	of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;


	 


	Adoption
	of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and


	 


	Exemption
	from registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted
	by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such sales are exempt from state law registration, documentation
	or offering requirements.

	In general, under
	the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities
	was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed
	fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:


	 


	(i) the
	completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,


	 


	(ii) the
	completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;


	 


	(iii) the
	company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or


	 


	(iv) the
	company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	The Company meets
	the definition of an emerging growth company will be affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and certain of the
	new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings.
	Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.


	 



	Financial Disclosure

	.
	The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933
	will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:


	 


	(i) audited financial
	statements required for only two fiscal years;


	 


	(ii) selected financial
	data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;


	 


	(iii) executive
	compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller reporting
	company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)


	 


	Notwithstanding, the
	requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions
	for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required
	to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most
	current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.


	 


	The JOBS Act also
	exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company
	Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required
	by SEC rule. The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation
	of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.


	 



	Internal Control
	Attestation

	. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public
	accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company
	is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.








	-

	15

	-









	 








	Section 102(a) of
	the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in 1934 Act Section 14A(e) for companies with a
	class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.


	 



	Other Items of
	the JOBS Act

	. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are
	qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior
	to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer
	about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition
	the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and
	potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.


	 


	Section 106 of the
	JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the
	registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is
	intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking
	to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a road
	show.


	 



	Election to Opt
	Out of Transition Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply
	with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration
	statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the
	new or revised financial accounting standard.


	The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition
	period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable.
	The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period. 




	 







	RISK
	FACTORS





	 




	An investment in
	the Shares offered for resale by the Selling Stockholders is highly speculative in nature, involves a high degree of risk, and
	is suitable only for persons who can afford to risk the loss of the entire amount invested.  Before purchasing any of these
	securities, you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects.  If any of the following
	risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.  In
	such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 




	 




	Risks Related to
	Our Business and Industry




	 




	Other IT solutions
	exist in the marketplace and thus the space is highly competitive.



	 


	Due to the growing
	savviness of IT users in overall, the business of IT solutions services is highly competitive and ever demanding in terms of speed
	and comprehensiveness. Smaller companies and individual freelancer of IT services provider have mushroomed within the region in
	the recent years to cater to every need of businesses. However, with the established of our presence in within the Asian countries
	and team of experts IT specialists, we are able to compete in the market competitively. Our network of business contacts within
	the Asian region have grown to allow us to tap on to them for potential new business.


	 








	-

	16

	-









	 











	Our failure to obtain
	capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations.



	 


	We will need to raise
	capital to expand our business. It is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of $5 million dollars over the
	next twenty-four months to fund our business plans. Future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may
	be available only on unacceptable terms.


	 



	We are subject
	to the risk that certain key personnel, including key employees named below, on whom we depend, in part, for our operations, will
	cease to be involved with us.  The loss of any these individuals would adversely affect our financial condition and the results
	of our operations.





	 




	We are dependent on
	the experience, knowledge, skill and expertise of our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, Eugene Wong.
	We are also in large part dependent on our Director, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Khoo Mae Ling and Cornelius Ee our
	Vice President of IT. The loss of any of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our future business efforts.
	Our success depends in substantial part upon the services, efforts and abilities of Mr. Wong due to his experience, history and
	knowledge of the business of, and services provided by, the Company. The inability of the Company to retain the services of Mr.
	Wong, or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could adversely affect our operations.  We do not currently
	carry key-man life insurance on Mr. Wong, or any of our officers, and have no present plans to obtain this insurance.  


	  



	Competition from
	other information technology related companies in the same space could result in a decrease our business and a decrease in our
	financial performance.



	 



	We
	operate in the highly competitive industry. Many of our current and potential competitors, including

	Alibaba, eBay, Amazon,
	Rakuten, Groupon, ASOS, Expedia and other

	, have existed longer and have larger customer bases, greater
	brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel, technical and other resources than the Company. In
	addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to research and development of new
	products, attracting and retaining key employees, maintaining a large budget for marketing and promotional expenses, and providing
	more favorable credit terms to suppliers and channel distributors.





	 





	The relative lack
	of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.



	 


	As a company with
	a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, we are subject to reporting and other legal, accounting, corporate governance,
	and regulatory requirements imposed by the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act.  Mr.
	Wong lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with these legal, accounting, and regulatory requirements.
	 Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis.  Our
	senior management may not be able to implement and effect programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately
	responds to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. Our failure to do so could lead
	to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business. 


	 



	Regulations, including
	those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform
	and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), increase the cost of doing business and may make it difficult for
	us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our business and our ability
	to obtain or retain listing of our common stock.









	-

	17

	-









	 








	The current regulatory
	climate for public companies, even small and emerging growth companies such as ours, may make it difficult or prohibitively expensive
	to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management
	in compliance with the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications
	from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors. The perceived increased personal risk associated
	with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.  For example, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act of 2002 has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing rules and regulations
	by the SEC.  Further, recent and proposed regulations under Dodd-Frank heighten the requirements for board or committee membership,
	particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level of experience in finance and accounting
	matters.  We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to
	attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business could be adversely affected.


	 



	The requirements
	of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business,
	particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”




	 



	We are required to
	comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these reporting
	and other regulatory requirements are time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business, results of
	operations and financial condition.


	 


	As a public company,
	we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and requirements of SOX. The cost of complying with these requirements
	may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with
	respect to our business and financial condition. SOX requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
	internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
	we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management
	oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements
	applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial
	resources to identify new professionals to join the Company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately
	support expansion. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	As an “emerging
	growth company,” we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements including, but
	not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of SOX (and rules and regulations
	of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as Section 404) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
	our periodic reports and proxy statements. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote
	increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up
	to five years, although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances. See “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — JOBS Act” for additional information on
	when we may cease to be deemed to be an emerging growth company. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we
	may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.


	 



	Our internal controls
	over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness,
	which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business.

	We are subject to
	various SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. We have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and, to a lesser
	extent, diversion of our management’s time in our efforts to comply with SOX Section 404 regarding internal controls over
	financial reporting.  Our management’s evaluation over our internal controls over financial reporting may determine
	that material weaknesses in our internal control exist.  If, in the future, management identifies material weaknesses, or
	our external auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or to express an opinion on the
	effectiveness of our internal controls, this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, have an adverse
	effect on our stock price, and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. 


	 



	Limitations on
	director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing
	suit against a director.  





	 




	Our Certificate of
	Incorporation and Bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by Delaware corporation law, that a director or officer
	shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions
	which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may
	discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative
	litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide
	for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law.   




	 





	We may incur a
	variety of costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies, products or technologies, to grow our business, to expand into
	new markets, or to provide new services.  As such, the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be realized.





	 




	It is management’s
	intention to acquire other businesses to grow our customer base, to expand into new markets, and to provide new product lines.
	 We may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies, although no
	additional material acquisitions or investments are currently pending.  Acquisitions may be accompanied by risks such as: 


	 




	 



	·




	difficulties in assimilating the operations and employees of acquired companies;





	 




	 



	·




	diversion of our management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;





	 




	 



	·




	our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired technology and rights into our products and services;





	 




	 



	·




	additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets;





	 




	 



	·




	additional expense associated with understanding and development of acquired business;





	 




	 



	·




	maintenance and implementation of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and





	 




	 



	·




	impairment of existing relationships with employees, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management employees.

	We must attract
	and retain skilled personnel.  If we are unable to hire and retain technical, sales and marketing, and operational employees,
	our business could be harmed.




	 



	Our revenues are generated
	by the sales of our information technology products and services from our direct sales, and to a lesser extent, our website.  Our
	ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified
	technical and managerial personnel. We intend to hire additional employees, including software developers, sales and marketing
	employees and operational employees.  The competition for developers and programmers, qualified sales, and managerial personnel
	in the information technology community, is intense, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel.
	 In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain compliance with all
	applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems in order to support our
	desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.


	  



	Our failure to
	manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating results.





	 




	There can be no assurance
	that we will be able to manage our expansion through acquisitions effectively. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures
	and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we employ personnel in
	multiple geographic locations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit
	our growth, damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business.


	  



	If
	we obtain financing, existing shareholder interests may be diluted.



	 


	If
	we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be
	diluted. In addition, any new securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Furthermore,
	we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that, if available, it will
	be on acceptable terms.



	 




	A large percentage
	of our business come from international operations and may affect financial results in U.S. dollar terms and could negatively impact
	our financial results.





	 




	A large percentage
	of our revenues come from international operations. Between January 1, 2016 and June 1, 2016, our revenues generated from international
	operations were $1,064,722 which is 80% of total revenue. We expect this trend to continue into the near future and have no system
	in place to combat currency risk.

	Risks Related to
	Our Common Stock



	 



	Our stock price may
	be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.



	 


	Once our shares begin
	trading, the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, in part because our shares have not been traded publicly.
	In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which
	we cannot control, including:




	 






	 



	·




	competition from other information technology companies or related businesses;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the nuclear power industry;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in key personnel;





	 




	 



	·




	entry into new geographic markets;





	 




	 



	·




	actions and announcements by us or our competitors or significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other radiation detection and related companies;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	·




	investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the nuclear power industry;





	  




	 



	·




	fluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;





	 




	 



	·




	the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;







	 




	 



	·




	announcements relating to litigation;





	 




	 



	·




	financial guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;





	 




	 



	·




	changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;





	 




	 



	·




	the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;





	 




	 



	·




	future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders; and





	 




	 



	·




	changes in accounting principles affecting our financial reporting.







	 










	-

	21

	-









	 








	These and other factors
	may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock markets and trading facilities,
	including the OTC Bulletin Board, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect
	the market prices of equity securities in many companies. In the past, stockholders of some companies have instituted securities
	class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial
	costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.




	 





	Our common stock is
	subject to risks arising from restrictions on reliance on Rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies.




	 



	Under a regulation
	of the SEC known as “Rule 144,” a person who has beneficially owned restricted securities of an issuer and who is not
	an affiliate of that issuer may sell them without registration under the Securities Act provided that certain conditions have been
	met. One of these conditions is that such person has held the restricted securities for a prescribed period, which will be 6 months
	or 1 year, depending on various factors. The holding period for our common stock would be 1 year if our common stock could be sold
	under Rule 144. However, Rule 144 is unavailable for the resale of securities issued by an issuer that is a shell company (other
	than a business combination related shell company) or that has been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC defines a shell
	company as a company that has (a) no or nominal operations and (b) either (i) no or nominal assets, (ii) assets consisting solely
	of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. Until
	the merger, we were a shell company. The SEC has provided an exception to this unavailability if and for as long as the following
	conditions are met:


	 




	 



	·




	The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company,





	   




	 



	·




	The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,





	 




	 



	·




	The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and





	 




	 



	·




	At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company known as “Form 10 Information.”





	  



	As
	a result, although the registration statement on Form 10 originally filed with the SEC on July 7, 2014, intended to provide “Form
	10 Information,” the original Form 10 stated only that the company was a blank-check shell, seeking a transaction with another
	entity.  On September 4, 2015, the Company filed a Current Report on


	Form
	8-K, frequently referred to as a “Super 8-K,” to provide additional information about the Company’s planned operations,
	contracts, shareholders, management, financial position, and other information constituting “Form 10 Information” under
	the SEC’s regulations.  



	 








	-

	-









	 








	Because of the Company’s history
	as a shell company, stockholders who receive our restricted securities will be able to sell them pursuant to Rule 144 without registration
	for only as long as we continue to meet those requirements and are not a shell company. No assurance can be given that we will
	meet these requirements or that we will continue to do so, or that we will not again be a shell company. Furthermore, any non-registered
	securities we sell in the future or issue for acquisitions or to consultants or employees in consideration for services rendered,
	or for any other purpose will have limited or no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the SEC and/or
	until a year after we have complied with the requirements of Rule 144. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations,
	to acquire assets and to pay our consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise
	funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause
	us to expend additional resources in the future. In addition, if we are unable to attract additional capital, it could have an
	adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan and sustain our operations.  Our status as a former “shell
	company” could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions,
	which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.


	 




	 


	Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock
	price.



	 


	Sales of substantial
	amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely
	affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares. Upon
	completion of this offering, we will have 12,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding.  Our shares of common stock offered
	in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares of our common stock
	that may be subsequently held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other “affiliates,” as that term
	is defined in the Securities Act, which will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may not be
	sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.


	 


	In the future, we
	may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in
	connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.
	Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.


	 



	If securities or
	industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and
	trading volume could decline.



	 


	The trading market
	for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our
	business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities
	or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If
	we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or
	publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these
	analysts ceased coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could
	cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

	Our internal controls
	over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify
	as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.



	 


	As a public company,
	we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under Section
	302. In addition, at such time as we cease to be an “emerging growth company,” as more fully described in these Risk
	Factors, we will be required to comply with Section 404. At such time, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able
	to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition,
	if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended
	from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls
	over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation,
	testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able to implement the requirements
	of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse
	opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory
	authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence
	in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control
	system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.


	  



	Our management
	and other affiliates have significant control of our common stock and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts with
	the interests of other stockholders.



	 


	After the offering,
	we anticipate that our executive officers, directors and their affiliated entities together will beneficially own the majority
	of our common stock, representing the majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, these stockholders,
	acting together, will be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including
	the election of directors, and may not always act in the best interests of other stockholders. Such a concentration of ownership
	may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise
	receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.


	 



	We do not expect
	to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.



	 


	The continued operation
	and growth of our business will require substantial cash. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends
	on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion
	of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions relating
	to indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Accordingly,
	if you purchase shares in this offering, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation of the price
	of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our
	common stock.


	 



	Anti-takeover provisions
	in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.



	 


	Our amended and restated
	Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of us more difficult
	without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions, among other things:








	-

	24

	-









	 














	· authorize the issuance of previously undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which
	may be established and the shares of which may be issued at the discretion of our Board of Directors without stockholder approval,
	and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of
	the holders of common stock;




	 








	· prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions
	to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;




	 








	· provide that only the chairperson of our Board of Directors, chief executive officer or
	a majority of the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of stockholders;




	 








	· provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our
	amended and restated Bylaws;




	 








	· provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors
	then in office, even though less than a quorum; and




	 








	· establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors
	or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.




	 


	These anti-takeover
	provisions and other provisions under Delaware law may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions,
	could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change-in-control, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders.
	These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors
	of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.



	 





	CAUTIONARY NOTE
	REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	Information included
	in this Prospectus may constitute “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements are based upon our current
	assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on our business. In some cases,
	you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,”
	“would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
	“believe,” “approximately,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,”
	“continue,” “ongoing,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although the absence
	of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. This information may involve known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different
	from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.


	 


	Factors that might
	cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” contained
	in this Prospectus. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Prospectus will
	prove to be accurate. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements
	for any reason after the date of this Prospectus, to conform these statements to actual results, or to changes in our expectations.
	You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after
	the date of this Prospectus.

	Use of Proceeds



	 


	The Selling Stockholders
	may sell all of the Shares covered by this Prospectus for their own accounts. Accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from
	the resale of the common stock. 



	 





	Dividend Policy



	 


	To date, we have never
	declared dividends or paid cash dividends on our common stock. In the future, if we become profitable, our Board of Directors
	may, in its discretion, declare a dividend on our common stock from our surplus earnings.  There is no assurance that we will
	ever become profitable or that we will have surplus earnings from which a dividend can be paid.  The declaration of dividends
	will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial position, general economic conditions
	and other pertinent factors.


	 



	Determination of
	Offering Price



	 


	The price of the shares
	offered by the Selling Stockholders is based ono a fixed pricing as a result of the Selling Shareholders being statutory underwriters.
	We have no agreement, written or oral, with our Selling Stockholders about this price in this offering.  The offering price
	may bear no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. The factors considered by a
	Selling Stockholder in setting the offer price for its Shares might include:


	 



	· 


	the
	risk or unpredictable nature of our business;




	· 


	the
	price at which we have sold our stock in offerings not registered under the Securities Act;




	· 


	what
	the Selling Stockholders consider to be our growth potential;




	· 


	the
	price at which we issued our Common Stock to certain of the Selling Stockholders in exchange for debt



	and for services;
	and



	· 


	the
	price the Selling Stockholder believes a purchaser is willing to pay for our stock;



	 


	Prior to this offering,
	there has been no market for our securities. 



	 





	MARKET FOR COMMON
	EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS



	 



	Market Information



	 


	There is no established
	public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may not be sustained. A
	stockholder in all likelihood, therefore, will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she desire to do so when
	eligible for public resale. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities as pledged collateral
	for loans unless a regular trading market develops. We have no plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings with any person
	with regard to the development of a trading market in any of our securities.


	 



	Penny Stock Considerations



	 


	Our shares likely
	will be “penny stocks” as that term is generally defined in the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
	thereunder to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus will be subject to rules that impose sales
	practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.


	 








	-

	26

	-









	 








	Under the penny stock
	regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make
	a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction
	prior to the sale. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 individually
	or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations
	the broker-dealer is required to:


	 









	· 


	Deliver,
	prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market,
	unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;





	 









	· 


	Disclose
	commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;





	 









	· 


	Send
	monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account, the account’s
	value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and





	 









	· 


	Make
	a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account.





	 


	Because of these regulations,
	broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of
	Selling Stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of
	trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of
	our securities, if our securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may be decreased, with
	a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such penny stock rules
	and our stockholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.


	 



	OTC Bulletin Board
	Qualification for Quotation



	 


	To have our shares
	of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a market for
	our common stock. We intend on engaging Spartan Securities Group Ltd, a FINRA Market Maker to file our application on Form 211
	with FINRA.


	 



	Holders



	 


	As of the date of this
	Prospectus, we have four holders of record of our common stock.


	 



	Dividends



	 


	We have not declared
	any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future.
	Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the
	Board of Directors deems relevant.

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION




	AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 



	You should read
	the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited financial statements and
	the notes to the audited financial statements included in the registration statement on Form S-1 of which this Prospectus is a
	part. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may
	differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.




	 



	We are an information
	technology (IT) web, systems integration and applications solutions company. We combine leading technology and draw upon our experience
	as professional IT specialists to create, design, develop and maintain corporate websites, e-commerce, social media strategies,
	server monitoring and supply computer hardware equipment on a global basis. We work to achieve this mission by using technology
	that is scalable, off-the-shelf, customizable, and communicates a clear message to our clients target market. We market third-party
	vendor software, IT services, and hardware that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to our client's
	business. We have also established our in-house research and development (R&D) team to focus on ecommerce solutions, mobile
	payment, and financial services as an increasing effort for our company to provide full life cycle solutions to clients. The company
	maintains an office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as its primary business focus is obtaining and servicing clients within the Asia-Pacific
	region.


	 


	Our market opportunity
	is in Asia and in particular, countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and China. We also find
	that markets in New Zealand and Australia are favorable to our industry as well.


	 


	We were incorporated
	in Delaware on June 23, 2014. On February 27, 2015, Elite Soft Asia purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock,
	which constituted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Elite Soft Asia had originally acquired these shares in a private,
	unsolicited transaction with the Company’s former shareholder, Richard Chiang. Elite Soft Asia proceeded to vote its shares
	in approving a change in control and the amendment to its articles of incorporation on March 16, 2015 changing the name of the
	Company to “EliteSoft Global Inc.”


	 


	Our international
	revenues were 100% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect this to increase over time as we continue to field new orders inquires
	and engage new customers overseas. We believe that Korea and China will likely be a larger contributor to revenue within the next
	few years. While we maintain steady growth domestically, the international side of our business may be a larger component.


	 


	Additionally, we are
	inexperienced as a public company and may find it difficult to meet all of the challenges and expenses of being a public company. 

	We
	plan to raise capital by offering shares of our common stock or convertible debt to investors.  For the next twenty-four months,
	we anticipate we will need approximately $5,000,000 in additional capital to fund our business plans. If we do not raise the required
	capital, we may not meet our expenses and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and if we do, we may find the
	cost of such financing to be burdensome on the Company. Additionally, we may not be able to execute on our business plans due to
	unforeseen market forces.

	For the three months
	ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net income of $31,773 and net loss of $43,741, respectively. The change in net loss
	between the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to the revenue of $272,552 generated during the
	three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $5,963 during the three months ended June 30, 2015.


	 


	For the six months
	ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net income of $73,677 and net loss of $46,190, respectively. The change in net loss
	between the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to the revenue of $1,070,685 generated during the
	six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $5,963 during the six months ended June 30, 2015.


	 


	Revenue - Total revenues
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016, were $272,552, compared to $5,963 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This resulted
	in an increase of approximately $266,589 from the comparable period. The increase in revenue is primarily a result of collection
	of 30% retainer fee from a major customer.


	 


	Revenue - Total revenues
	for the six months ended June 30, 2016, were $1,070,685, compared to $5,963 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This resulted
	in an increase of approximately $1,064,722 from the comparable period. The increase in revenue is primarily a result of completion
	of over 50% of the major contract secured in first quarter of 2016.



	Operating Expenses - Operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016, was $40,245, as compared to $47,904 for the three
	months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease of $7,659 in general and administrative expense
	for the three months ended June 30, 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred professional
	fees of $34,140 and $nil, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
	stock based compensation of $nil and $43,285, respectively.

	Expenses - Operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was $55,834, as compared to $50,353 for the six months ended
	June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase of $5,481 in general and administrative expense for
	the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the increase of $39,592 in professional fess offset by the decrease of $43,285 in stock
	based compensation. The Company also recorded $10,800 of salaries and wages as general and administrative expenses for the six
	months ended June 30, 2016. Salaries and wages was included in cost of revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015.

	At June 30, 2016,
	total assets increased by 204%, to $733,735 from $241,600 at December 31, 2015 principally related to increase in cash and accounts

	works outsourced to third party.


	 


	Our working capital
	accounts consist of cash and accounts receivable. Claims against working capital include accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	amounts due to related parties, and income tax payable. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods, certain
	amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for support services and the subsequent collection of those
	billings. The Company had working capital of $82,217 and $13,540 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

	months ended June 30, 2015 was $3,686. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to the timing
	of collections from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors.


	 


	Net cash provided
	by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $150,374. Net cash used in operating activities for the period

	by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $nil as compared to $50,000 for the six months ended June 30,
	2015. The change in cash from financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from note payable issued to relate party during
	the six months ended June 30, 2015.

	Critical Accounting
	Policies



	 


	Our financial statements
	and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States ("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting
	principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can also affect
	supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial
	condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively
	applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
	the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue
	to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.

	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts
	for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and
	liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences,
	and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
	in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	Under ASC 740, a tax
	position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in
	a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that
	is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not”
	test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


	We believe the following
	is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant
	accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction
	with this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


	 



	We
	qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on
	exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:




	 





	 



	·




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;





	 




	 



	·




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 




	 



	·




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and





	 




	 



	·




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation.






	 



	In addition, Section
	107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
	in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
	growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
	We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not
	be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.


	 








	-

	32

	-









	 








	We will remain an
	“emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year
	in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer”
	as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares
	that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter
	or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	As an emerging growth
	company, the company is exempt from Section 14A and B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval
	of executive compensation and golden parachutes.


	 



	The
	Company is an Emerging Growth Company under the JOBS Act of 2012, but the Company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(B) of the JOBS Act. 




	 

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 



	In
	August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”.
	The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain
	not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted
	only as of annual reporting periods beginning after


	December 15,
	2016, including interim reporting periods within


	that reporting
	period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.



	 


	In November 2015 the
	FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred taxes are classified
	on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current.
	Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities at March
	31, 2016 and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December 31, 2015.


	 


	In February 2016,
	the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based on the principle
	that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly change the
	lessees’ recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the
	previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The

	In March 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
	Revenue Gross versus Net)”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of the
	implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding
	additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments
	is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”.
	Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”.
	The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
	those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: (a)
	income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement
	of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.

	Significant Employees



	 



	We
	are dependent on the experience, knowledge, skill and expertise of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Eugene Wong, We are
	also dependent on our Chief Financial Officer, Khoo Mae Ling

	and Cornelius Ee our Vice President of IT

	.
	The loss of any of the key personnel listed above could materially and adversely affect our future business efforts. Our success
	depends in substantial part upon the services, efforts and abilities of Mr. Wong, due to his experience, history and knowledge
	of the information technology space and his overall insight into our short-term and long-term business plans. The loss or our failure
	to retain Mr. Wong, or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could adversely affect our operations.  We do
	not currently carry key-man life insurance on Mr. Wong or any of our officers and have no present plans to obtain this insurance.



	 



	Involvement in
	Certain Legal Proceedings



	There have been no
	events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees material to the evaluation
	of the ability and integrity of any director, executive officer, promoter or control person of the Company during the past five
	years.

	Compliance with Section

	Section 16(a) of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Section 16(a)"), requires our Directors and executive officers, and persons
	who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities (collectively, "Section 16 reporting
	persons"), to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our Common Stock and other
	equity securities. Section 16 reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
	forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of any such reports furnished to us, none of the Section
	16 reporting persons failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to our
	most recent fiscal year, and through March 31, 2016.

	policy and provides strategic direction, oversight, and control of the Company.  As of the date of this Prospectus, the Board
	of Directors had no standing audit, compensation, nominating or other committees, although the Board intends to establish such
	committees in the future.  


	 



	Code of Ethics



	 


	As of the date of
	this Prospectus, we had not adopted a formal, written code of conduct (“Code of Ethics”) within the specific guidelines
	promulgated by the SEC, although we intend to adopt a Code of Ethics in the near future.

	Procedures for
	Security Holders to Nominate Directors



	 


	Our Bylaws do not
	provide a procedure for shareholders to nominate directors.  The Board of Directors does not currently have a standing nominating
	committee.  The Board of Directors currently has the responsibility of selecting individuals to be nominated for election
	to the Board of Directors.  Qualifications considered by the Directors in nominating an individual may include, without limitation,
	independence, integrity, business experience, education, accounting and financial expertise, reputation, civic, community and industry
	relationships and industry knowledge.  In nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board of Directors, the Directors
	will consider and review an existing director’s Board and Committee attendance, performance and length of service.

	ended June 30, 2016, we did not compensate our directors for acting as such.


	 



	Audit Committee



	 


	As of the date of
	this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Audit Committee.  We intend to establish an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
	which will consist of independent directors, of which at least one director will qualify as a qualified financial expert as defined
	in the regulations of the SEC.  The Audit Committee’s duties would be to recommend to our Board of Directors the
	engagement of independent auditors to audit our consolidated financial statements and to review our accounting and auditing principles.  The
	Audit Committee would review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by
	the internal auditors, if any, and independent public accountants, including their recommendations to improve the system of accounting
	and internal control.  The Audit Committee would at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are, in the opinion
	of our Board of Directors, free from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee
	member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.  As of the date
	of this Prospectus, we did not have an audit committee financial expert, in light of our size, although we intend to review this
	issue as the Company grows, especially as the Company implements a standing Audit Committee.

	Compensation Committee



	 


	As of the date of
	this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Compensation Committee.  We intend to establish a Compensation Committee of the
	Board of Directors.  The Compensation Committee would review and approve our salary and benefits policies, including
	compensation of executive officers.  The Compensation Committee would also administer any stock option plans that we
	may adopt and recommend and approve grants of stock options under such plans.


	 



	Nominating and
	Corporate Governance Committee

	 


	 


	As of the date of
	this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  We intend to establish a Nominating
	and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors to assist in the selection of director nominees, approve director
	nominations to be presented for stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders and fill any vacancies on our Board
	of Directors, consider any nominations of director candidates validly made by stockholders, and review and consider developments
	in corporate governance practices.



	 





	Executive Compensation



	 



	Company;
	No other officer receives compensation from the Company. Until the Company acquires additional capital, it is not anticipated that
	any other officer other than these

	four

	individuals will receive compensation from the Company
	other than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. The Company has no stock option, retirement,
	pension, or profit sharing programs for the benefit of directors, officers or other employees, but our officers and directors may
	recommend adoption of one or more such programs in the future. We may enter into further agreements following our receipt of additional
	capital. The Company does not have a standing compensation committee, audit committee, nomination committee, or committees performing
	similar functions.  We anticipate that we will form such committees of the Board of Directors once we have a full Board of
	Directors.

	DESCRIPTION OF
	SECURITIES



	 



	General



	 


	The following summary
	includes a description of material provisions of the Company’s capital stock.


	 



	Authorized Capital
	Stock



	 


	The authorized capital
	stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, (hereinafter referred to in this
	section as the “Common Stock”), of which there are 12,000,000 issued and outstanding, and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred
	Stock, (hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Preferred Stock”) par value $.0001 per share, of which none
	have been designated or issued. The following summarizes important information regarding our capital stock.


	 








	-

	39

	-









	 









	Common Stock



	 


	Holders of shares
	of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of Common Stock
	do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared
	from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution
	or winding up of the company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in
	full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of Common Stock
	have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company’s Common Stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking
	fund provisions with respect to the Common Stock.


	 



	Preferred Stock



	 


	The Board of Directors
	is authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and, by filing
	a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in
	each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications,
	limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued
	would have priority over the Common Stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future issuance of preferred stock
	may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company without further action by the stockholders
	and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock. At present, we have no plans to neither issue
	any preferred stock nor adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock.


	 


	The issuance of shares
	of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
	For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights
	that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that
	would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred
	stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Common Stock. Although the Board of Directors is required to
	make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, the Board of Directors
	could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders
	might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market
	price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently
	authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules. We have no present plans to issue any preferred stock.


	 


	The description of
	certain matters relating to the securities of the Company is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our
	Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement on Form 10 filed
	with the SEC on July 7, 2014.

	Dividends



	 


	We have not paid any
	dividends on our Common Stock and do not presently intend to pay cash dividends prior to the consummation of a business combination.
	The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements
	and general financial condition subsequent to consummation of a business combination, if any. The payment of any dividends subsequent
	to a business combination, if any, will be within the discretion of our then existing Board of Directors. It is the present intention
	of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, the Board of Directors
	does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 


	 



	Pre-emptive Rights



	 


	Holders of Common
	Stock are not entitled to pre-emptive or subscription or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions
	applicable to the Common Stock.


	 



	Share Purchase
	Warrants



	 


	We have not issued
	and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase Common Stock.


	 



	Options



	 


	We have not issued
	and do not have outstanding any options to purchase Common Stock.


	 



	Convertible Securities



	 


	We have not issued
	and do not have outstanding any securities convertible into common shares or any rights convertible or exchangeable into Common
	Stock.


	 



	Trading of Securities
	in Secondary Market



	 


	The Company presently
	has 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, all of which are “restricted securities,” as that term
	is defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, in that such shares were issued in private transactions not involving
	a public offering. This Prospectus, and the Registration Statement of which it is a part, registers the resale by the Selling Shareholders
	of all 12,000,000 shares of the Common Stock, constituting 100% of the shares held by the Selling Shareholders. Following the effectiveness
	of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part, we plan to apply for quotation of our securities on the OTC Bulletin
	Board.

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES



	 


	In
	accordance with the provisions in our articles of incorporation, we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or director,
	to the full extent permitted by law.


	 


	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling
	persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
	that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities mother than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
	officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director, officer
	or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter
	has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

	Mr. Ee Chang Ku has advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured, bears no interest,
	contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management has not
	determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015. The loan is not yet convertible as the
	shares are not publicly traded on an exchange. The shares associated with the potential conversion are not being registered herein.


	 


	During the quarter
	ended September 30, 2015, Mr. Ee loaned the Company $3,331 for general operating expenses. The loan is unsecured, non-interest
	bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owed $3,331 to Mr. Ee.

	in the amount of $10,000.  This contract has been completed at December 31, 2015 and $10,000 is included in cost of revenues
	earned at December 31, 2015.  Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related party is $10,000 related to

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS



	 


	The Company is registering
	for offer and sale by existing holders thereof 12,000,000 shares of common stock held by such shareholders. The Company will not
	receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling Shareholder shares. The Selling Shareholders have no agreement with any underwriters
	with respect to the sale of the Selling Shareholder Shares. The Selling Shareholders, who are deemed to be statutory underwriters,
	will offer their shares at the fixed price of $0.10 per share in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary broker’s
	transactions, privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one or more dealers for resale.


	 


	The Selling Shareholders
	may from time to time offer the Selling Shareholder shares through underwriters, dealers or agents, which may receive compensation
	in the form of underwriting discounts, concessions or commissions from them and/or the purchasers of the Selling Shareholder shares
	for whom they may act as agents. Any agents, dealers or underwriters that participate in the distribution of the Selling Shareholder
	shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” under the Securities Act and any discounts, commissions or concessions received
	by any such underwriters, dealers or agents might be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities Act.

	Once the registration
	statement of which this Prospectus is part becomes effective with the SEC, and once a public market develops, the Selling Shareholders
	may sell the shares indicated above in public transactions or otherwise, on the OTC Bulletin Board (or such other public market
	as may develop) or in privately negotiated transactions. Those public resales may be at the fixed price of $0.10.  The Selling
	Shareholders act independently of one another in making a determination to sell the shares owned by them and they do not act as
	or form a group for purposes of their ownership or disposition of the shares offered hereunder. There is no guarantee that a public
	market in the common stock will develop in the future.



	 





	SHARES ELIGIBLE
	FOR FUTURE SALE



	 


	As of the date of
	this Prospectus, there are 12,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding of which 12,000,000 shares are owned by officers and directors
	of the Company, or affiliates thereof. There will be 12,000,000 shares outstanding if the maximum number of Shares offered herein
	is sold. The shares of common stock held by current shareholders are considered “restricted securities” subject to
	the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In general, securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid
	and held for more than 12 months. While affiliates of the Company are subject to certain limits in the amount of restricted securities
	they can sell under Rule 144, there are no such limitations on sales by persons who are not affiliates of the Company. In the event
	non-affiliated holders elect to sell such shares in the public market, there is likely to be a negative effect on the market price
	of the Company’s securities.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	All of the shares
	herein, if and when sold, are being offered and sold by the Selling Shareholders or their pledgees, donees, transferees or other
	successors in interest.  We will not receive any proceeds from those sales.




	 






	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	This Prospectus relates
	to the resale of up to 12,000,000 Shares held by the Selling Shareholders as described above. Once the registration statement of
	which this Prospectus is part becomes effective, the Selling Shareholders, and any of their pledges, donees, assignees and other
	successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares on any stock exchange, market or trading facility
	on which the shares are traded, or in private transactions. Those sales to the public are to be fixed at $0.10 per share, and may
	be at negotiated prices in private sales. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when selling
	shares:


	 



	· 


	ordinary
	brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;




	· 


	block
	trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block
	as principal to facilitate the transaction;




	· 


	purchases
	by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;




	· 


	an
	exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;




	· 


	privately
	negotiated transactions;




	· 


	broker-dealers
	may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares;




	· 


	through
	the writing of options on the shares;




	· 


	a
	combination of any such methods of sale; and




	· 


	any
	other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.



	 


	The Selling Shareholders
	or their pledges, donees, transferees or other successors in interest, may also sell the shares directly to market makers acting
	as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents for themselves or their customers. Such broker-dealers may receive compensation
	in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the Selling Shareholders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such
	broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell as principal or both, which compensation as to a particular broker-dealer
	might be in excess of customary commissions.


	 


	Market makers and
	block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is possible that the Selling
	Shareholders will attempt to sell shares in block transactions to market makers or other purchasers. The Selling Shareholders cannot
	assure that all or any of the shares offered in this Prospectus will be sold by the Selling Shareholders. In addition, the Selling
	Shareholders and any brokers, dealers or agents, upon effecting the sale of any of the shares offered in this Prospectus are “underwriters”
	as that term is defined under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations under such acts. In such event,
	any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed
	to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.


	 


	Discounts, concessions,
	commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares will be borne by the Selling Shareholders.
	The Selling Shareholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving
	sales of the Shares if liabilities are imposed on that person under the Securities Act.

	The Selling Shareholders
	may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of their shares and, if it defaults in the performance
	of its secured obligations, the pledgee or secured parties may offer and sell the shares from time to time under this Prospectus
	after we have filed an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or any other applicable provision of the Securities Act
	amending the list of Selling Shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as a Selling Shareholders
	under this Prospectus.


	 


	The Selling Shareholders
	also may transfer the shares in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors in interest will
	be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this Prospectus and may sell the shares from time to time under this Prospectus
	after we have filed an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the Securities Act amending
	the list of Selling Shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as a Selling Shareholders under
	this Prospectus.


	 


	As noted above, each
	Selling Shareholders is an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with the sale of our
	common stock under this Prospectus. We will pay all expenses incident to the registration, offering and sale of the shares to the
	public hereunder other than commissions, fees and discounts of underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents of the Selling Shareholders.
	If any of these other expenses exists, we expect the applicable Selling Shareholder to pay these expenses.


	 


	The Selling Shareholders
	acquired the shares offered hereby in the ordinary course of business and they have advised us that they have not entered into
	any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of the shares, nor is
	there an underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with a proposed sale of shares by the Selling Shareholders. We
	will file a supplement to this Prospectus if the Selling Shareholders enter into a material arrangement with a broker-dealer for
	sale of common stock being registered. If the Selling Shareholders use this Prospectus for any sale of the shares, it will be subject
	to the Prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.


	 


	Pursuant to a requirement
	by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, the maximum commission or discount to be received by any FINRA member
	or independent broker/dealer may not be greater than eight percent of the gross proceeds received by the Selling Stockholders for
	the sale of any securities being registered pursuant to SEC Rule 415 under the Securities Act.


	 


	The anti-manipulation
	rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, may apply to sales of Shares and activities of the Selling Shareholders. The Selling
	Shareholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale.

	DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION
	POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION




	FOR SECURITIES ACT
	LIABILITIES



	 


	Subsection (a) of
	Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is
	a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal,
	administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or
	was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
	officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including
	attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with
	such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
	best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his
	conduct was unlawful.


	 


	Subsection (b) of
	Section 145 empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
	pending or completed action or suit by right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such
	person acted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably
	incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
	reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification may be made
	in respect to any claim issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless
	and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
	that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
	entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.


	 


	Section 145 further
	provides that to the extent a director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in the defense
	of any such action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 or in the defense of any claim, issue
	or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred
	by him in connection therewith; that the indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
	rights which the indemnified party may be entitled; that indemnification provided by Section 145 shall, unless otherwise provided
	when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
	to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and administrators; and empowers the corporation to purchase and maintain
	insurance on behalf of a director or officer of the corporation against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him
	in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him
	against such liabilities under Section 145.


	 


	Section 102(b)(7)
	of the General Corporation Law or the State of Delaware provides that a certificate of incorporation may contain a provision eliminating
	or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
	duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of the director (i) for any breach
	of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or
	which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.








	-

	46

	-









	 








	Article X of our Charter
	provides that, “to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of this corporation shall
	not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.”


	 


	Article XI, Section
	1(c) of our Bylaws further provides that “Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or is
	involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that
	he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer, of the Corporation shall
	be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as
	the same exists or may hereafter be amended.”


	 


	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling the Company pursuant
	to the foregoing provisions, the Company has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	(UNAUDITED)



	 


	1.   

	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	EliteSoft
	Global Inc., (the “Company”, or “EliteSoft Global”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 23,
	2014. The Company was formerly known as ANDES 3 Inc. and changed its name to EliteSoft Global Inc. on March 23, 2015. The Company
	currently generates revenue by providing web and IT services to a limited number of clients. The Company provides the following
	services: (a) Creation and design of corporate images and materials, (b) Website design and development, (c) Development of e-commerce
	software for sales transactions, (d) Supplying required computer hardware to operate online businesses, (e) 24/7 server monitoring,
	(f) Creation of social media strategies via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and (g) Video production services for infomercials.


	  


	2.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
	POLICIES



	 



	Basis
	of Presentation

	 – The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
	and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most
	recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
	consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations
	for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily
	indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate
	the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K,
	have been omitted.


	 



	Use
	of estimates

	 – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
	These estimates and judgments are based on historical information, information that is currently available to the Company and on
	various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from
	those estimates.


	 



	Cash
	and cash equivalents

	 – The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of
	three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are
	primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those investments approximates fair value.


	 



	Accounts
	receivable

	– Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, and are stated
	at the amount the Company expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts
	based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. Management considers accounts receivable to be
	fully collectible at June 30, 2016.

	Revenue
	recognition

	– The Company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and IT services. Web and IT services revenues
	consist of fees from web design, software development, domain and hosting, and maintenance and other services. The Company recognizes
	revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and
	collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds
	to customers in the event of cancellations. The Company records revenues net of sales taxes. Revenues from web design, software
	development are generally recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise
	transfers to the customer, and the collection is reasonably assured. Revenues from IT consulting services, domain and hosting,
	and maintenance services are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract.  


	 


	The Company
	also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development, domain and
	hosting, and maintenance and other services, with the term ranging from one month to two years. The Company analyzes its agreements
	to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance
	with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	605-25, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
	Recognition”. Allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the element’s
	fair value in accordance with ASC 605 and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above. During the
	year ended December 31, 2015, in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, the Company acted as an agent in the
	transaction. As the agent, it records revenues on a net basis. Customer payments received in advance of the performance of services
	are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when the web and IT services are rendered.


	 



	Cost
	of revenues

	– Cost of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and IT services for
	its clients and primarily consists of subcontracted services.


	 



	Earnings
	(loss) per share

	 – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to
	common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
	common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common
	stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding
	if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. At June 30, 2016, the Company had a $50,000 loan from a stockholder which is
	convertible on demand. Management has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at June 30, 2016.


	 



	Stock-based
	compensation

	 – The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services
	from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10, “Compensation- Stock Compensation”, and FASB ASC 505-50,
	“Equity- Based Payments to Non-Employees”. Costs are measured at the estimated fair value of the consideration received
	or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the equity instruments
	issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of
	performance by the provider of goods or services.

	Related
	parties

	– A related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company’s securities
	and their immediate families, (ii) the Company's management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled
	by or is under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions
	of the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations
	between related parties.


	 



	Income
	taxes

	 – The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities
	are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
	amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
	Accounting standards regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation
	allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the
	need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a more-likely-than-not
	realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative
	losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Company’s experience with
	operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.


	 


	The
	Company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax
	assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of operations
	improve and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to reduce the
	valuation allowance.


	 


	Significant
	judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During the
	ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
	Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain
	tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
	indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation
	processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely, based solely
	on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating
	its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.


	 



	Fair
	value of financial instruments

	– The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial
	assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
	value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related
	to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
	markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
	unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	 








	F-

	6










	 








	Level 1
	– Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
	to access at the measurement date.


	 


	Level 2
	– Inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either
	directly or indirectly.


	 


	Level 3
	– Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.


	 


	The Company
	does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis. For certain
	of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable and accrued
	liabilities, amounts due to related parties and income tax payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short
	maturities.


	 


	Transactions
	involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
	free market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
	related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
	representations can be substantiated. It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due from/to related
	parties due to their related party nature.


	  



	Foreign
	currency transactions and translation

	– The Company records and settles all transactions in U.S. Dollars based on the
	current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date, therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet
	date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income.


	 



	Accounting
	standards note yet adopted



	 



	In
	August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”.
	The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain
	not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted
	only as of annual reporting periods beginning after


	December 15,
	2016, including interim reporting periods within


	that reporting
	period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.



	 


	In November
	2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred taxes
	are classified on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified
	as non-current. Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities
	at March 31, 2016 and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December 31,
	2015.

	In February
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based on the principle
	that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly change the
	lessees’ recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the
	previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The
	effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted.  Management continues to
	assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial statements.


	  


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
	(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
	of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
	adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
	amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606)”. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
	on its financial statements.


	 


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
	Accounting”. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
	interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified,
	including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
	the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 


	3.   

	GOING CONCERN







	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
	contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has retained
	earnings of $36,932 as of June 30, 2016. The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities.
	The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment
	of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition,
	ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully
	resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
	of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	In February
	2015, a Company stockholder advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured, bears
	no interest, contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management
	has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at June 30, 2016. The Loan is not yet convertible
	as the shares are not publically traded on an exchange


	 


	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2015, Mr. Cornelius Ee, Vice President of the Company, advanced the Company $3,331 for general
	operating expenses. The advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of June 30, 2016,
	the Company owed $3,331 (December 31, 2015 - $3,331) to Mr. Cornelius Ee.


	 


	During
	2015, the Company entered into a six-month service contract with ELITESOFT ASIA PTE LTD, a shareholder of the Company, to provide
	the Company with website design, development and integration with the Company’s CRM Program as well as web-based automated
	tracking system for the Company’s nationwide operations –customer relation management program. The total contract value
	is approximately $414,000. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred cost of $331,162 under this contract.
	Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related party is $206,976 (December 31, 2015 - $10,000) related to this
	contract.

	STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY



	 



	Preferred
	Stock 

	– The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value preferred stock. As of June 30,
	2016, no shares of preferred stock had been issued.


	 



	Common
	Stock

	 - The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value common stock. As of June 30, 2016 and
	December 31, 2015, 12,000,000 and 12,250,000 shares were issued and outstanding, respectively.


	 


	On March
	23, 2016, the Company cancelled 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company that had been previously issued due to termination
	of consulting agreement dated May 1, 2015 and reversed stock-based compensation of $5,000 that was recognized during the year ended
	December 31, 2015.  The $5,000 was recorded as other income during the six months ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	7.   

	CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

	 


	During
	the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated revenues from five customers and one major customer accounted for 95%
	of the Company’s revenue. The accounts receivable from this major customer was 82% of the total accounts receivable. No other
	customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or accounts receivable. The loss of the major customer could have an adverse effect
	on the Company’s business, operating results, or financial condition.

	2015 AUDITED FINANCIALS





	 






	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
	REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 



	To the Board of Directors
	and Shareholders of


	EliteSoft Global,
	Inc.,


	 


	We have audited the
	accompanying balance sheet of Elitesoft Global, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements
	of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements
	are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit
	in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
	we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
	audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion,
	the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EliteSoft Global,
	Inc. as of December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the Company has
	incurred recurring losses since inception, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
	Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	To
	the Board of Directors




	Andes
	3, Inc.




	 



	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Andes 3, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014, and the related
	statements of operations, change in stockholders’ deficit and statement of cash flows for the period from June 23, 2014 (Inception)
	to December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
	to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
	reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required to
	have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
	of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
	but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
	in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
	Company as of December 31, 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from June 23, 2014 (Inception)
	to December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to
	the financial statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions, among others, raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described
	in Note 3, which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity. The financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Note 2
	–SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 



	Basis
	of Presentation



	 


	The
	accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 



	Concentrations



	The Company
	deposits cash with a national bank within the United States of America and at times throughout the year may maintain balances that
	exceed federally insured limits of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. There was no uninsured cash at December 31, 2015 or
	2014. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes the Company is not exposed to any unusual
	credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.


	 



	Use
	of Estimates



	 


	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The
	Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
	Cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds. The carrying
	value of those investments approximates fair value.









	F-

	Accounts
	Receivable



	 


	Accounts
	receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, and are stated at the amount the Company expects
	to collect from outstanding balances. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts
	that are believed to be uncollectible. Management considers accounts receivable to be fully collectible at December 31, 2015.


	 



	Revenue
	Recognition



	 


	The Company derives
	its revenues primarily from providing web and IT services. Web and IT services revenues consist of fees from web design, software
	development, domain and hosting, and maintenance and other services. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of
	an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
	The Company's service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event of cancellations.
	The Company records revenues net of sales taxes. Revenues from web design, software development are generally recognized after
	the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer, and the collection
	is reasonably assured. Revenues from IT consulting services, domain and hosting, and maintenance services are generally recognized
	on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract.  


	 


	The
	Company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development, domain
	and hosting, and maintenance and other services, with the term ranging from one month to two years. The Company analyzes its agreements
	to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance
	with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	605-25, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
	Recognition”. Allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the

	element’s
	fair value in accordance with ASC 605 and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above. During the
	year ended December 31, 2015, in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, the Company acted as an agent in the
	transaction. As the agent, it records revenues on a net basis. Customer payments received in advance of the performance of services
	are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when the web and IT services are rendered.




	 




	Cost
	of Revenues



	 


	Cost
	of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and IT services for its clients and primarily
	consists of subcontracted services.


	 



	Earnings
	(loss) per share



	 


	Basic earnings (loss)
	per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares
	of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
	shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number
	of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. At December
	31, 2015, the Company had a $50,000 note payable which is convertible on demand. Management has not determined the conversion rate
	on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015.




	 











	F-

	19










	 







	 




	Stock-based
	compensation



	 


	The Company accounts
	for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB
	ASC 718-10, Compensation- Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity- Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are measured
	at the estimated fair value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
	is more reliably measurable. The value of the equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined
	on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services.


	 



	Related
	Parties




	 



	A
	related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company's securities and their immediate families,
	(ii) the Company's management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
	with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
	is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.


	 



	Income
	Taxes



	 


	The Company accounts
	for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC Topic No. 740, requires a company to use
	the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
	differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	Under ASC Topic No.
	740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be
	sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of
	tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely
	than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.


	 


	Management has analyzed
	the Company’s material tax positions and has determined that no material uncertain tax positions exist that require recognition
	or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements.


	 



	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company follows
	guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements
	of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally,
	the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
	gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
	and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of fair
	value hierarchy are as follows:


	 








	F-

	20










	 








	Level 1 – Inputs are
	quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at
	the measurement date.


	 


	Level 2 – Inputs are
	inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly.


	 


	Level 3 – Inputs are
	unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.




	The
	Company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis. For
	certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts
	payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenue, the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities.


	 


	Transactions
	involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
	freemarket dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related
	party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations
	can be substantiated. It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due from/to related parties due to their
	related party nature.


	  



	Foreign
	Currency Transactions and Translation



	 


	The Company
	records and settles all transactions in U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction date, therefore
	there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive income.


	 



	Accounting
	Standards Not Yet Adopted



	 


	In August
	2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”.
	The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain
	not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted
	only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
	period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.




	 




	In
	November 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred
	taxes are classified on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities
	to be classified as non-current. Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has recorded a valuation
	allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December 31, 2015 and 2014.


	 








	F-

	21










	 








	In February
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based on the principle
	that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly change the
	lessees’ recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from the
	previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The
	effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted.  Management continues to
	assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
	(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”. 'The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
	of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
	adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
	amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606)”. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
	on its financial statements.


	 


	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
	Accounting”. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
	interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified,
	including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
	the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 



	Going
	Concern



	 


	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
	in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has a deficit accumulated of $36,745 as of
	December 31, 2015. The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities. The Company’s
	ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing,
	the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment
	of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors
	raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company
	do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

	Note 3 - RELATED
	PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 


	In February 2015,
	a Company stockholder advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured, bears no interest,
	contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management has not determined
	the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015. The Loan is not yet convertible as the shares are
	not publically traded on an exchange


	 


	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2015, Mr. Cornelius Ee, Vice President of the Company, advanced the Company $3,331 for general
	operating expenses. The advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2015,
	the Company owed $3,331 to Mr. Cornelius Ee.


	 


	During
	2015, the Company entered into a six month service contract with ESA is to provide the Company with website design, development
	and integration with the Company’s CRM Program as well as web-based automated tracking system for the Company’s nationwide
	operations –customer relation management program.  The total contract value is approximately $414,000.  No services
	under this contract have been incurred at December 31, 2015.  The Company had a second contract with ESA to provide website
	design and development in the amount of $10,000.  This contract has been completed at December 31, 2015 and $10,000 is included
	in cost of revenues earned at December 31, 2015.  Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related party
	is $10,000 related to this second contract.

	Common
	Stock



	 


	The
	Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.


	On June 23, 2014 (date
	of inception), the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Richard Chiang as share-based compensation. The
	fair value of the shares issued was determined to be $2,000. The compensation cost was fully recognized during 2014.


	 


	On February 20, 2015,
	Richard Chiang, then the Company’s sole director and shareholder, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "SPA")
	whereby EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd.("ESA") purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from Mr. Chiang,
	which constituted 100% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $40,000. Upon Mr. Chiang's resignation following
	the execution of the SPA, ESA, as the Company’s sole shareholder elected Mr. Eugene Wong, as a Director of the Company.


	 


	Pursuant to its assignment
	assumption agreement, dated June 1, 2015, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock to
	ESA. The agreement provides for revenue of $2,000 a month and will cease on January 1, 2018 subject to yearly renewal with the
	consent of both parties. The shares for the agreement were valued at $43,285. The shares were valued based on expected revenue
	over the initial term of the agreement of $62,000 less cost of revenue.

	On May 1, 2015, the
	Company entered into a six-month consulting agreement with Tech Associates, Inc., an entity owned by the Company’s former
	stockholder, Richard Chiang. As part of the total consideration paid, the Company issued 250,000 shares of restricted common stock
	on October 1, 2015 to Tech Associates, Inc. (Note 7). The fair value of the shares issued was determined to be $5,000 based on
	the share price from the most recent share issuance on June 1, 2015 with ESA. The compensation cost was recognized over the initial
	service term of six months. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $5,000 of stock-based compensation was recognized.


	 



	Preferred
	Stock



	 


	The Company’s
	board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock in one or more series.
	The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock,
	including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, and number of shares
	constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting
	dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the liquidation rights
	of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of December 31, 2015, no shares of preferred stock were
	outstanding.

	The
	Company has incurred losses since inception and has a deficit accumulated of $36,745 as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the
	Company recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as management does not expect to have the ability to utilize them
	within the carryforward period. Management will reassess the realization of the deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards
	for income taxes for each reporting period. To the extent the financial results of operations improve and it becomes more likely
	than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to reduce the valuation allowance.

	14.   INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.



	 


	Section 145
	of the 

	Delaware General Corporation Law (referred to as the "DGCL")

	 provides
	that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending
	or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in
	the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
	or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
	joint venture, trust or other enterprise), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
	actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner
	he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action
	or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in the case of derivative
	actions (i.e., actions by or in the right of the corporation), except that indemnification extends only to expenses, including
	attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action and the statute requires court approval before
	there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation.


	 


	Our
	amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that limit the liability
	of our directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Consequently, our directors will
	not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except liability
	(a) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders; (b) for any act or omission
	not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; (c) under Section 174 of the
	DGCL regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases; or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an
	improper personal benefit.


	 


	Any
	amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any
	act, omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the DGCL is amended to provide for
	further limitations on the personal liability of directors or officers of corporations, then the personal liability of our
	directors and officers will be further limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.


	 


	In addition, we intend to enter
	into indemnification agreements with our current directors and officers containing provisions that are in some respects
	broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the DGCL.


	 


	 






	-

	49

	-









	 








	 


	 


	These indemnification agreements
	will require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status
	or service as directors and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could
	be indemnified. We also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our future directors and officers. We intend to maintain
	liability insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities, including certain liabilities
	under arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, that may be incurred by them in their capacity as such.


	 


	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
	us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	15.    RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.



	 


	On June 23, 2014,
	the Company offered and sold 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Richard Chiang, its sole officer and director, in exchange for
	incorporation fees and annual resident agent fees in the State of Delaware, and developing our business concept and plan. The Company
	sold these shares of Common Stock under the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.


	 


	On February 20, 2015,
	the sole officer and director of the Company, Mr. Chiang, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) pursuant
	to which he entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company’s common stock
	to EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd. These shares represented 100% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. Effective
	upon the closing date of the SPA, Mr. Chiang resigned from his positions, and owned no shares of the Company’s stock and
	EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd was the majority stockholder of the Company. Effective on the same date and following the execution of the
	SPA, EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd elected Eugene Wong, as a director of the Company and transferred its shares to the officers and directors
	of the Company.


	 


	We relied upon Section
	4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for the above issuances. We believed that Section 4(2) was available because:


	 




	 



	•




	None of these issuances involved underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	We placed restrictive legends on all certificates issued;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	No sales were made by general solicitation or advertising;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	Sales were made only to accredited investors















	-

	50

	-









	 






	 


	In connection with the
	above transactions, we provided the following to all investors:


	 




	 



	•




	Access to all our books and records.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	Access to all material contracts and documents relating to our operations.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	•




	The opportunity to obtain any additional information, to the extent we possessed such information, necessary to verify the accuracy of the information to which the investors were given access.






	The Company’s Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued common stock -without stockholder
	approval. The Company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock, other than the shares associated with the
	conversion of the shareholder loan with EliteSoft Asia as disclosed above. However, the Company will, in all likelihood, issue
	a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination. Since the Company expects to issue additional
	shares of common stock in connection with a business combination, existing stockholders of the Company may experience substantial
	dilution in their shares. However, it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result in dilution
	to existing shareholders. If the target has a relatively weak balance sheet, a business combination may result in significant dilution.
	If a target has a relatively strong balance sheet, there may be little or no dilution.

	ii.




	To reflect in the Prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of Prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.

	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;





	 




	 



	2.




	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	3.




	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	 




	 




	 



	4.




	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:





	 




	 



	 i.




	Any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	ii.




	Any free writing Prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;





	 


	 


	 




	 



	iii.




	The portion of any other free writing Prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and 





	  




	 



	iv.




	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.





	 




	 



	5.



	 



	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: Each Prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than Prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or Prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.

	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons, we
	have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy
	as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
	such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
	corporation in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person
	in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by
	a controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by us is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such case.

		Re:	Legal




	Opinion and Consent letter






	Registration
	Statement on Form S-1






	 




	Dear Board of Directors:


	We have
	acted as counsel to EliteSoft Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the filing of
	the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the United States Securities
	and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”). The Company is seeking the registration of 12,000,000 shares of its common
	stock (the “Shares”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Shares are
	titled to “Selling Shareholders” defined under the Registration Statement. Following the effectiveness of the Registration
	Statement, the Company intends to commence the offering of the Shares in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In the preparation
	of this opinion, we have relied solely on (i) various facts and factual assumptions as set forth in the Registration Statement;
	and (ii) certain representations made by the Company as to factual matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the
	“Management Certificate”). For purposes hereof, items (i) and (ii) are referred to collectively herein as the “Opinion
	Materials.” In addition to reviewing the Opinion Materials, in connection with rendering the opinions expressed below, we
	have examined originals (or copies identified to our satisfaction as true copies of the originals) of the following documents:
	(a) the Registration Statement, (b) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company dated June 23, 2014 authorizing 100,000,000 shares
	of common stock with a par value of $0.0001, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001, and as subsequently
	amended, (c) the Bylaws of the Company, and (d) such other documents deemed by us to be relevant to this opinion letter as may
	have been presented to us by the Company from time to time.


	We have
	assumed, with your consent, that the representations set forth in the Management Certificate are true, accurate, and complete as
	of the date hereof. While we are not aware of any facts inconsistent with the representations set forth in the Management Certificate,
	we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in any of the Opinion Materials (or other aspects
	of the Registration Statement unless set forth herein). In addition, we have examined no documents other than the Opinion Materials
	for purposes of this opinion and, therefore, our opinion is limited to matters determined through such an examination.  







	-

	1

	- 









	 









	In rendering
	the opinion set forth herein, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of
	all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to authentic original
	documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. Based solely on our review of the Opinion Materials, we are of the opinion
	that:








	(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the
	laws of the State of Delaware, including statutory provisions, and all applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporations
	Law (the “DGCL”), and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws;




	 








	(b) The Company has taken all requisite corporate action and all other action recognized as being
	consistent with standards of proper corporate governance required with respect to the authorization, issuance and sale of common
	stock issued pursuant to the Registration Statement;




	 








	(c) The 12,000,000 shares of common stock being offered in the Registration Statement are duly
	authorized, unencumbered and not subject to any actual or threatened litigation, and not subject to any defaults or failures by
	the Company in filing annual reports with the State of Delaware;




	 








	(d) The rights, duties and obligations related to the 12,000,000 shares of common stock being offered
	in the Registration Statement are governed by the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, and where necessary, the
	DGCL;




	 








	(f) The questionnaire completed and signed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
	is accurate.




	 


	Based upon and in
	reliance upon the foregoing, and after examination of such corporate and other records, certificates and other documents and such
	matters of law as we have deemed applicable or relevant to this opinion, it is our opinion that the Company has been duly incorporated
	and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
	and has full corporate power as described in the Registration Statement.

	          The
	authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, as defined in the Articles of Incorporation,
	with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which there are currently 12,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. The Company has not
	issued shares of preferred stock. The Company has taken proper corporate action to authorize such authorized capital stock and
	all the outstanding shares of such capital stock (including those shares being registered under the Registration Statement), when
	delivered in the manner and/or on the terms described in the Registration Statement (after it is declared effective), are duly
	and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The current shareholder of the Company has no preemptive rights with respect
	to the Common Stock.


	 


	This correspondence
	is necessary in conjunction with the submission of the Registration Statement, and thus the Board of Directors is hereby authorized
	to attach it as the Firm’s opinion related to certain representations in the Registration Statement, and to reference the
	Firm in the Registration Statement. This correspondence, however, does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
	as to unrelated or future matters.


	 


	I consent to the
	prospectus discussion of any and all legal opinions disclosed in the Registration Statement. This opinion is being furnished to
	the Company solely in connection with the Company's filing of the Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
	and we hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit thereto. In giving such consent, we do not hereby admit that we
	are included within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder.

	PRELIMINARY
	PROSPECTUS SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED JANUARY __, 2017




	ELITESOFT
	GLOBAL, INC.





	 



	 


	  



	This
	is the initial offering of common stock of EliteSoft Global, Inc. (the “Company” or “we” or “our”),
	and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered herein as “Selling Shareholder” shares. We
	are offering for sale a total of 12,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.10 per share. We estimate our total
	offering registration costs to be approximately $24,520.84.


	There is no minimum number
	of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and the Selling Shareholders will retain the proceeds from the
	sale of any of the offered shares.




	 




	The
	Selling Shareholders intend on selling their respective shares for the fixed price of $0.10 per share for the duration of the
	offering. The Selling Shareholders are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The Selling Shareholders do not have a current arrangement
	or agreement with any underwriters, broker-dealers or selling agents for the sale of the shares subject to this Prospectus. If
	a Selling Shareholder enters into such an arrangement or agreement, the shares of such Selling Shareholder will be sold through
	such licensed underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling agent(s). No public market currently exists for the securities being
	offered. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that must be sold by us to proceed, and the Selling Shareholders
	will retain the proceeds from the sale of any shares of the common stock.

	We
	are an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. Investing in our common stock
	involves a high degree of risk. You should purchase shares only if you can afford a complete loss of your investment. See "Prospectus
	Summary and Risk Factors" starting on page 7. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), nor
	any state securities commission, has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this Prospectus is truthful
	or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.






	 





	There
	has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained.
	Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of this Prospectus,
	we intend on having a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”)
	for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the appropriate United States trading exchange or market. We do not yet have
	a market maker who has agreed to file such an application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted
	on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.




	 




	Neither
	the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy
	of this Prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree
	of risk. Before buying any of our common stock, you should carefully read the discussion of material risks of investing in our
	common stock in the section titled "Risk Factors" in this Prospectus. The Selling Shareholders may use this Prospectus
	to offer the common stock from time to time.




	 








	As set
	forth in this Prospectus, we have previously issued common stock on a restricted basis to the Selling Shareholders identified
	herein in consideration of cash and assuming significant start-up expenses for the benefit of the company. For as long as this
	stock is “restricted” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, we will, to the extent required,
	furnish to any shareholder, or to any prospective purchaser designated by such shareholder, upon request of such shareholder,
	financial and other information described in paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 144 with respect to the Company to the extent required in
	order to permit such shareholder to comply with Rule 144 with respect to any resale of their stock, unless during that time, we
	are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule
	12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act and no such information about the Company is otherwise required pursuant to Rule 144.




	 








	 




	Until
	ninety business days after the effective date of this Prospectus, all dealers that effect transactions in these securities whether
	or not participating in this offering may be required to deliver a Prospectus. This is in addition to the dealer's obligation
	to deliver a Prospectus when acting as underwriters and with respect to their unsold allotments or subscriptions.

	You may

	PROSPECTUS
	SUMMARY AND RISK FACTORS






	This
	Prospectus contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases,
	you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may", "should", "expects", "plans",
	"anticipates", "believes", "estimates", "predicts", "potential" or "continue"
	or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors," that may cause our
	or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.






	While
	these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current
	judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates,
	predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein. Except as required by applicable law, including
	the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
	to actual result

	s.





	Although
	management believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements included in this filing are reasonable, they
	do not guarantee our future performance, and actual results could differ from those contemplated by these forward looking statements.
	The assumptions used for purposes of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates
	of future events and are subject to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances.
	As a result, the identification and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions
	from and among reasonable alternatives require the exercise of judgment.






	To
	the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially from anticipated or projected results, and,
	accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking statements. In the light of these risks and
	uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained
	in this filing will in fact transpire. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
	speak only as of their dates. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.






	Factors
	that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in "Risk Factors"
	contained in this report. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Prospectus
	will prove to be accurate. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
	statements for any reason after the date of this report, to conform these statements to actual results, or to changes in our expectations.
	You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the SEC after
	the date of this statement.

	is only required to produce financial statements as follows: (a) audited balance sheet as of the end of each of the most recent
	two fiscal years, or as of a date within 135 days if the issuer has existed for a period of less than one fiscal year, (b) audited
	statements of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for each of the two fiscal years preceding the date of the
	most recent audited balance sheet (or such shorter period as the registrant has been in business), and (c) interim reviewed financial
	statements for the current period if the filing is more than 135 days after the end of your fiscal year.  Any and all amendments
	shall include updated interim or audited financial statements if the financial statements in the prior filing are more than 135
	days old.

	RISK
	FACTORS






	 






	An
	investment in the Shares offered for resale by the Selling Stockholders is highly speculative in nature, involves a high degree
	of risk, and is suitable only for persons who can afford to risk the loss of the entire amount invested.  Before purchasing
	any of these securities, you should carefully consider the following factors relating to our business and prospects.  If
	any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely
	affected.  In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 






	 






	Risks
	Related to Our Business and Industry






	 






	Other IT solutions exist
	in the marketplace and thus the space is highly competitive.





	 




	Due to
	the growing savviness of IT users in overall, the business of IT solutions services is highly competitive and ever demanding in
	terms of speed and comprehensiveness. Smaller companies and individual freelancer of IT services provider have mushroomed within
	the region in the recent years to cater to every need of businesses. However, with the established of our presence in within the
	Asian countries and team of experts IT specialists, we are able to compete in the market competitively. Our network of business
	contacts within the Asian region have grown to allow us to tap on to them for potential new business.




	 





	Our failure to obtain capital
	may significantly restrict our proposed operations.





	 




	We will
	need to raise capital to expand our business. It is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of $5 million
	dollars over the next twenty-four months to fund our business plans. Future sources of capital may not be available to us when
	we need it or may be available only on unacceptable terms.




	 





	We
	are subject to the risk that certain key personnel, including key employees named below, on whom we depend, in part, for our operations,
	will cease to be involved with us.  The loss of any these individuals would adversely affect our financial condition and
	the results of our operations.







	 






	We are
	dependent on the experience, knowledge, skill and expertise of our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President,
	Eugene Wong. We are also in large part dependent on our Director, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Khoo Mae Ling and Cornelius
	Ee our Vice President of IT. The loss of any of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our future business
	efforts. Our success depends in substantial part upon the services, efforts and abilities of Mr. Wong due to his experience, history
	and knowledge of the business of, and services provided by, the Company. The inability of the Company to retain the services of
	Mr. Wong, or to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could adversely affect our operations.  We do not currently
	carry key-man life insurance on Mr. Wong, or any of our officers, and have no present plans to obtain this insurance.  




	  





	Competition
	from other information technology related companies in the same space could result in a decrease our business and a decrease in
	our financial performance.





	 




	We operate
	in the highly competitive industry. Many of our current and potential competitors, including Alibaba, eBay, Amazon, Rakuten, Groupon,
	ASOS, Expedia and other, have existed longer and have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater
	financial, marketing, personnel, technical and other resources than the Company. In addition, many of these competitors may be
	able to devote significantly greater resources to research and development of new products, attracting and retaining key
	employees, maintaining a large budget for marketing and promotional expenses, and providing more favorable credit terms to suppliers
	and channel distributors.

	The relative lack of public
	company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.





	 




	As a
	company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, we are subject to reporting and other legal, accounting,
	corporate governance, and regulatory requirements imposed by the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated under the
	Exchange Act.  Mr. Wong lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with these legal, accounting,
	and regulatory requirements.  Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures
	on a timely basis.  Our senior management may not be able to implement and effect programs and policies in an effective and
	timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal and regulatory compliance and reporting requirements.
	Our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and further result in the deterioration of our business. 




	 





	Regulations,
	including those contained in and issued under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) and the Dodd–Frank Wall
	Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”), increase the cost of doing business and may make
	it difficult for us to retain or attract qualified officers and directors, which could adversely affect the management of our
	business and our ability to obtain or retain listing of our common stock.





	 




	The current
	regulatory climate for public companies, even small and emerging growth companies such as ours, may make it difficult or prohibitively
	expensive to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective
	management in compliance with the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies, including, but not limited to, certifications
	from executive officers and requirements for financial experts on boards of directors. The perceived increased personal risk associated
	with these recent changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.  For example, the enactment of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in the issuance of a series of new rules and regulations and the strengthening of existing
	rules and regulations by the SEC.  Further, recent and proposed regulations under Dodd-Frank heighten the requirements for
	board or committee membership, particularly with respect to an individual’s independence from the corporation and level
	of experience in finance and accounting matters.  We may have difficulty attracting and retaining directors with the requisite
	qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified officers and directors, the management of our business could
	be adversely affected.




	 





	The
	requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to
	manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”






	 





	We are
	required to comply with various regulatory and reporting requirements, including those required by the SEC. Complying with these
	reporting and other regulatory requirements are time-consuming and expensive and could have a negative effect on our business,
	results of operations and financial condition.




	 




	As a
	public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and requirements of SOX. The cost of complying
	with these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly
	and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. SOX requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls
	and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
	and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide
	effective management oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the
	standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management,
	operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join the Company and to maintain appropriate operational
	and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business
	concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	 




	As an
	“emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements
	including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of SOX (and
	rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, which we refer to as Section 404) and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive
	compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional
	expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We will remain an “emerging growth
	company” for up to five years, although we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances.
	See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — JOBS Act”
	for additional information on when we may cease to be deemed to be an emerging growth company. We cannot predict or estimate the
	amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.

	Our
	internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to
	their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business.





	 




	We are
	subject to various SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements. We have incurred and will continue to incur expenses and,
	to a lesser extent, diversion of our management’s time in our efforts to comply with SOX Section 404 regarding internal
	controls over financial reporting.  Our management’s evaluation over our internal controls over financial reporting
	may determine that material weaknesses in our internal control exist.  If, in the future, management identifies material
	weaknesses, or our external auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or to express an
	opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, this could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports,
	have an adverse effect on our stock price, and subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities. 




	 





	Limitations
	on director and officer liability and our indemnification of our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing
	suit against a director.  







	 






	Our Certificate
	of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by Delaware corporation law, that a director or officer
	shall not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions
	which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may
	discourage stockholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative
	litigation brought by stockholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
	provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law.   






	 







	We
	may incur a variety of costs to engage in future acquisitions of companies, products or technologies, to grow our business, to
	expand into new markets, or to provide new services.  As such, the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions may never be
	realized.







	 






	It is
	management’s intention to acquire other businesses to grow our customer base, to expand into new markets, and to provide
	new product lines.  We may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, complementary companies, products or technologies,
	although no additional material acquisitions or investments are currently pending.  Acquisitions may be accompanied by risks
	such as: 




	 






	•
	difficulties in assimilating the operations and employees of acquired companies;






	 






	•
	diversion of our management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;






	 






	•
	our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful incorporation of acquired
	technology and rights into our products and services;






	 






	•
	additional expense associated with amortization of acquired assets;






	 






	•
	additional expense associated with understanding and development of acquired business;






	 






	•
	maintenance and implementation of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; and






	 






	•
	impairment of existing relationships with employees, suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of new management
	employees. 






	 







	We
	must attract and retain skilled personnel.  If we are unable to hire and retain technical, sales and marketing, and operational
	employees, our business could be harmed.






	 





	Our revenues
	are generated by the sales of our information technology products and services from our direct sales, and to a lesser extent,
	our website.  Our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective
	sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel. We intend to hire additional employees, including software developers,
	sales and marketing employees and operational employees.  The competition for developers and programmers, qualified sales,
	and managerial personnel in the information technology community, is intense, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient
	qualified personnel.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain
	compliance with all applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems
	in order to support our desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.



	 








	-

	9

	-
















	  





	Our
	failure to manage growth effectively could harm our ability to attract and retain key personnel and adversely impact our operating
	results.







	 






	There
	can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion through acquisitions effectively. Our current and planned personnel,
	systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operations, especially as we
	employ personnel in multiple geographic locations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel,
	which may limit our growth, damage our reputation and negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business.




	  





	If
	we obtain financing, existing shareholder interests may be diluted.





	 




	If
	we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will
	be diluted. In addition, any new securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.
	Furthermore, we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when and to the extent we require or that, if available,
	it will be on acceptable terms.




	 




	In
	addition, in the event the convertible note with Mr. Ee Chang Ku, a director and shareholder of EliteSoft Asia, a shareholder
	and affiliate of the Company, is converted into shares of the Company’s common stock, there will be a dilutive impact on
	all shareholders. Furthermore, since the actual conversion rate has yet to be definitively agreed upon by the Company and Mr.
	Ee Chang Ku, the scope and breadth of the dilutive impact might be greater than anticipated, which would have an impact on the
	overall holdings of all shareholders. Also, if we elect to raise additional funds by issuing additional restricted stock or through
	convertible debt, the shareholders will be diluted to the extent of the specific issuance or subsequent conversion, and any new
	securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock or stock registered herein.





	 






	A
	large percentage of our business come from international operations and may affect financial results in U.S. dollar terms and
	could negatively impact our financial results.







	 






	A large
	percentage of our revenues come from international operations. Between January 1, 2016 and June 1, 2016, our revenues generated
	from international operations were $1,064,722 which is 80% of total revenue. We expect this trend to continue into the near future
	and have no system in place to combat currency risk.




	 





	We
	lack a history of profitable operations and our auditor has issued an opinion about our ability to continue as a going concern.





	 




	The
	lack of profitable operations, as set forth in our financial statements herein, and our auditor’s opinion and report that
	there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern materially affects and impairs our business plan and
	objectives set forth herein.




	 





	Our
	officers and directors do not reside in the United States, which might make service of process of any civil complaint not practical
	or achievable.





	 




	The
	Company is incorporated in the State of Delaware. However, our directors and officers reside outside the United States. As a result,
	to the extent claims arise against the directors and officers, securing service of process on the directors and officers might
	not be practicable, achievable or possible.




	 





	Our
	failure to obtain capital may significantly restrict our proposed operations.





	 




	We
	will need to raise capital to expand our business. It is anticipated that we will require an additional capital raise of $5 million
	dollars over the next twenty-four months to fund our business plans. We do not have adequate or sufficient capital resources or
	liquidity to carry out our short-term or long-term business plans, and our auditor has issued a report that there is substantial
	doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which will materially affect and impair these objectives. We have been
	internally funding through our shareholders, officers and directors, and through a convertible note, as disclosed herein, and
	from revenue generated through our performance under our agreement with Ashita, which is now concluded. There is no guarantee
	that we will secure similar revenues from current or future customers, or that our shareholders will continue to fund the operations
	of the business. Although our intention is to utilize the funding through the sale of Selling Shareholder shares in this registration
	statement, there is no guarantee that such funding will occur, or that a Selling Shareholder will agree to continue to fund the
	short-term or long-term business plans of the Company. Future sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or
	may be available only on unacceptable terms.

	Risks
	Related to Our Common Stock





	 





	Our stock price may be
	volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.





	 




	Once
	our shares begin trading, the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, in part because our shares have not
	been traded publicly. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of
	factors, most of which we cannot control, including:




	 






	•
	competition from other information technology companies or related businesses;






	 














	•
	changes in key personnel;






	 






	•
	entry into new geographic markets;






	 






	•
	actions and announcements by us or our competitors or significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint
	ventures or capital commitments;






	 














	•
	fluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and
	those expected by investors;






	 






	•
	the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings
	with the SEC;






	 






	•
	announcements relating to litigation;






	 






	•
	financial guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;






	 






	•
	changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these
	estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;






	 






	•
	the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;






	 






	•
	future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders; and






	 






	•
	changes in accounting principles affecting our financial reporting. 






	 




	These
	and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock markets
	and trading facilities, including the OTC Bulletin Board, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected
	and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities in many companies. In the past, stockholders of some companies have
	instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation,
	we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.

	Our common stock is subject
	to risks arising from restrictions on reliance on Rule 144 by shell companies or former shell companies.






	 





	Under
	a regulation of the SEC known as “Rule 144,” a person who has beneficially owned restricted securities of an issuer
	and who is not an affiliate of that issuer may sell them without registration under the Securities Act provided that certain conditions
	have been met. One of these conditions is that such person has held the restricted securities for a prescribed period, which will
	be 6 months or 1 year, depending on various factors. The holding period for our common stock would be 1 year if our common stock
	could be sold under Rule 144. However, Rule 144 is unavailable for the resale of securities issued by an issuer that is a shell
	company (other than a business combination related shell company) or that has been at any time previously a shell company. The
	SEC defines a shell company as a company that has (a) no or nominal operations and (b) either (i) no or nominal assets, (ii) assets
	consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or (iii) assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal
	other assets. Until the merger, we were a shell company. The SEC has provided an exception to this unavailability if and for as
	long as the following conditions are met:




	    






	•
	The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company,






	 






	•
	The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,






	 






	•
	The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the
	preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current
	Reports on Form 8-K; and






	 






	•
	At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting
	its status as an entity that is not a shell company known as “Form 10 Information.” 






	   




	As a
	result, although the registration statement on Form 10 originally filed with the SEC on July 7, 2014, intended to provide “Form
	10 Information,” the original Form 10 stated only that the company was a blank-check shell, seeking a transaction with another
	entity.  On September 4, 2015, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, frequently referred to as a “Super 8-K,”
	to provide additional information about the Company’s planned operations, contracts, shareholders, management, financial
	position, and other information constituting “Form 10 Information” under the SEC’s regulations.  




	 




	Because
	of the Company’s history as a shell company, stockholders who receive our restricted securities will be able to sell them
	pursuant to Rule 144 without registration for only as long as we continue to meet those requirements and are not a shell company.
	No assurance can be given that we will meet these requirements or that we will continue to do so, or that we will not again be
	a shell company. Furthermore, any non-registered securities we sell in the future or issue for acquisitions or to consultants
	or employees in consideration for services rendered, or for any other purpose will have limited or no liquidity until and unless
	such securities are registered with the SEC and/or until a year after we have complied with the requirements of Rule 144. As a
	result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations, to acquire assets and to pay our consultants with our securities instead
	of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree
	to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. In addition, if we
	are unable to attract additional capital, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan and sustain
	our operations.  Our status as a former “shell company” could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging
	consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions, which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline
	in value or become worthless.


	 






	 


	Future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock
	price.

	of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these sales could
	occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of
	additional shares. Upon completion of this offering, we will have 12,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding.  Our shares
	of common stock offered in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any
	shares of our common stock that may be subsequently held or acquired by our directors, executive officers and other “affiliates,”
	as that term is defined in the Securities Act, which will be restricted securities under the Securities Act. Restricted securities
	may not be sold in the public market unless the sale is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration
	is available.




	 




	In the
	future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock
	issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our
	common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution
	to you.

	If
	securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our
	stock price and trading volume could decline.





	 




	The trading
	market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about
	us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no
	securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted.
	If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock
	or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these
	analysts ceased coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could
	cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.




	 





	Our
	internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective and our independent registered public accounting firm may not
	be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.





	 




	As a
	public company, we are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting
	under Section 302. In addition, at such time as we cease to be an “emerging growth company,” as more fully described
	in these Risk Factors, we will be required to comply with Section 404. At such time, we may identify material weaknesses that
	we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of
	Section 404. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified,
	supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have
	effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. We cannot be certain as to the timing of
	completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we are not able
	to implement the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public
	accounting firm may issue an adverse opinion due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting and we may be subject
	to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the
	financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, we may be required
	to incur costs in improving our internal control system and the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively
	affect our results of operations and cash flows.




	  





	Our
	management and other affiliates have significant control of our common stock and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts
	with the interests of other stockholders.





	 




	After
	the offering, we anticipate that our executive officers, directors and their affiliated entities together will beneficially own
	the majority of our common stock, representing the majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result,
	these stockholders, acting together, will be able to exercise considerable influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders,
	including the election of directors, and may not always act in the best interests of other stockholders. Such a concentration
	of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control, including transactions in which our stockholders
	might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.

	We
	do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.





	 




	The continued
	operation and growth of our business will require substantial cash. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash
	dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at
	the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions
	relating to indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
	Accordingly, if you purchase shares in this offering, realization of a gain on your investment will depend on the appreciation
	of the price of our common stock, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not
	purchase our common stock.




	 





	Anti-takeover
	provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider
	favorable.





	 




	Our amended
	and restated Certificate of Incorporation and amended and restated Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of
	us more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions, among other things:




	 






	•
	authorize the issuance of previously undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of
	which may be issued at the discretion of our Board of Directors without stockholder approval, and which may include supermajority
	voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;






	 






	•
	prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;






	 






	•
	provide that only the chairperson of our Board of Directors, chief executive officer or a majority of the Board of Directors
	may call a special meeting of stockholders;






	 






	•
	provide that our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated Bylaws;






	 






	•
	provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though
	less than a quorum; and






	 






	•
	establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that
	can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.





	 







	These anti-takeover provisions
	and other provisions under Delaware law may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions, could discourage,
	delay or prevent a transaction involving a change-in-control, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions
	could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing
	and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS






	 





	Information
	included in this Prospectus may constitute “forward-looking statements”. Forward-looking statements are based upon
	our current assumptions, expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on our business. In
	some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “may,” “will,” “could,”
	“would,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
	“believe,” “approximately,” “estimate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,”
	“continue,” “ongoing,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although the absence
	of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. This information may involve known and unknown
	risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different
	from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements.




	 




	Factors
	that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors”
	contained in this Prospectus. As a result of these factors, we cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Prospectus
	will prove to be accurate. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking
	statements for any reason after the date of this Prospectus, to conform these statements to actual results, or to changes in our
	expectations. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with
	the SEC after the date of this Prospectus.





	 







	Use of Proceeds





	 




	The Selling
	Stockholders may sell all of the Shares covered by this Prospectus for their own accounts. Accordingly, we will not receive any
	proceeds from the resale of the common stock. 





	 







	Dividend
	Policy





	 




	To date,
	we have never declared dividends or paid cash dividends on our common stock. In the future, if we become profitable, our
	Board of Directors may, in its discretion, declare a dividend on our common stock from our surplus earnings.  There is no
	assurance that we will ever become profitable or that we will have surplus earnings from which a dividend can be paid.  The
	declaration of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial position,
	general economic conditions and other pertinent factors.




	 





	Determination
	of Offering Price





	 




	The price
	of the shares offered by the Selling Stockholders is based ono a fixed pricing as a result of the Selling Shareholders being statutory
	underwriters. We have no agreement, written or oral, with our Selling Stockholders about this price in this offering.  The
	offering price may bear no relationship whatsoever to our assets, earnings, book value or other criteria of value. The factors
	considered by a Selling Stockholder in setting the offer price for its Shares might include:




	 







	•
	the risk or unpredictable nature of our business; 




	 








	•
	the price at which we have sold our stock in offerings not registered under the Securities Act; 




	 








	•
	what the Selling Stockholders consider to be our growth potential; 




	 







	•
	the price at which we issued our Common Stock to certain of the Selling Stockholders in exchange for debt







	and
	for services; and




	 







	•
	the price the Selling Stockholder believes a purchaser is willing to pay for our stock. 






	 




	Prior
	to this offering, there has been no market for our securities.

	MARKET
	FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS





	 





	Market Information





	 




	There
	is no established public trading market for our securities and a regular trading market may not develop, or if developed, may
	not be sustained. A stockholder in all likelihood, therefore, will not be able to resell his or her securities should he or she
	desire to do so when eligible for public resale. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a lending institution will accept our securities
	as pledged collateral for loans unless a regular trading market develops. We have no plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings
	with any person with regard to the development of a trading market in any of our securities.




	 





	Penny
	Stock Considerations





	 




	Our shares
	likely will be “penny stocks” as that term is generally defined in the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
	promulgated thereunder to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus will be subject to rules that
	impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.




	 





	Under
	the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited
	investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchaser’s written
	consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income
	exceeding $200,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor. In addition,
	under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to:



	 






	•
	Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny
	stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;






	 






	•
	Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations
	for the securities;






	 






	•
	Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customer’s account,
	the account’s value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and






	 






	•
	Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customer’s account. 






	  




	Because
	of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to sell shares of our common stock, which may
	affect the ability of Selling Stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of
	reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could
	impede the sale of our securities, if our securities become publicly traded. In addition, the liquidity for our securities may
	be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our securities. Our shares in all probability will be subject to such
	penny stock rules and our stockholders will, in all likelihood, find it difficult to sell their securities.




	 





	OTC
	Bulletin Board Qualification for Quotation





	 




	To have
	our shares of common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, a market maker must file an application on our behalf in order to make a
	market for our common stock. We intend on engaging Spartan Securities Group Ltd, a FINRA Market Maker to file our application
	on Form 211 with FINRA.




	 





	Holders





	 




	As of the date of this Prospectus,
	we have four holders of record of our common stock.




	 





	Dividends





	 




	We have
	not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable
	future. Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts,
	as the Board of Directors deems relevant.

	MANAGEMENT’S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION






	AND
	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 





	You
	should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited financial
	statements and the notes to the audited financial statements included in the registration statement on Form S-1 of which this
	Prospectus is a part. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual
	results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.






	 





	We are
	an information technology (IT) web, systems integration and applications solutions company. We combine leading technology and
	draw upon our experience as professional IT specialists to create, design, develop and maintain corporate websites, e-commerce,
	social media strategies, server monitoring and supply computer hardware equipment on a global basis. We work to achieve this mission
	by using technology that is scalable, off-the-shelf, customizable, and communicates a clear message to our clients target market.
	We market third-party vendor software, IT services, and hardware that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced
	value to our client's business. We have also established our in-house research and development (R&D) team to focus on ecommerce
	solutions, mobile payment, and financial services as an increasing effort for our company to provide full life cycle solutions
	to clients. The company maintains an office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as its primary business focus is obtaining and servicing
	clients within the Asia-Pacific region.




	 




	Our market
	opportunity is in Asia and in particular, countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and China.
	We also find that markets in New Zealand and Australia are favorable to our industry as well.




	 




	We
	were incorporated in Delaware on June 23, 2014. On February 20, 2015, Elite Soft Asia purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s
	common stock, which constituted all issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Elite Soft Asia had originally acquired these
	shares in a private, unsolicited transaction with the Company’s former shareholder, Richard Chiang. Elite Soft Asia proceeded
	to vote its shares in approving a change in ownership,

	by
	transferring its 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to three directors as described herein,

	and 

	an

	amendment to its articles of incorporation on March 16, 2015 changing the name of the Company to “EliteSoft Global
	Inc.”




	 




	Our
	international revenues were 100% of our total revenue in 2015. We expect this to increase over time as we continue to field new
	orders inquires and engage new customers overseas. We believe that Korea and China will likely be a larger contributor to revenue
	within the next few years.




	 









	Due to the Company’s lean structure
	and limited human resources, there may be changes in cost of revenue from period to period. For example, web content development
	and auto tracking systems for CRM were outsourced to third party vendors. This resulted in substantial payments to third party
	vendors for the performance of the Company’s material contracts.


	 


	A factor in the Company’s ability
	to comply with its contractual obligations is the performance of third-party vendors. Mr. Cornelius Ee, the Company’s Vice
	President of Information Technology, is instrumental in coordinating with and supervising third-party vendors in order to complete
	work in a timely manner in order to comply with the Company’s contractual obligations.







	 




	Additionally,
	we are inexperienced as a public company and may find it difficult to meet all of the challenges and expenses of being a public
	company. 

	We plan to raise capital by offering shares of our common stock or convertible
	debt to investors.  For the next twenty-four months, we anticipate we will need approximately $5,000,000 in additional capital
	to fund our business plans. If we do not raise the required capital, we may not meet our expenses and there can be no assurance
	that we will be able to do so and if we do, we may find the cost of such financing to be burdensome on the Company. Additionally,
	we may not be able to execute on our business plans due to unforeseen market forces.

	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net loss of $22,816 and net loss of $2,371, respectively. The
	change in net loss between the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was primarily attributable to the reduction in gross
	profit as the Company relies heavily on third-party vendors to supply the labor for the scope of work associated with our contracts.
	Gross profit (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was ($20,263) as compared to $12,489 for the three months ended
	September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the general and administrative expense was increased by
	$9,186. The Company also recorded an income tax recovery of $21,458 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
	to $nil during the three months ended September 30, 2015.




	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we reported a net income of $50,861 and net loss of $48,561, respectively.
	The change from a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to a net income for the nine months ended September 30,
	2016 was primarily attributable to $1,239,258 of revenue recognized in association with contracts entered in May, September, October
	of 2015 and Q3 of fiscal 2016 as compared to $23,852 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Of the $1,239,258 revenue
	recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $1,162,791 was related to the contract entered in October of 2015.
	Although the gross profit increased from $16,652 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $134,610 for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2016, the gross profit margin decreased significantly. The reason for the decrease in gross profit margin
	is that the Company incurred substantial costs as it relies heavily on third-party vendors to supply the labor for the scope of
	work associated with the Company’s contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the general and administrative
	expense was increased by $9,667 and the income tax expense was increased by $8,976.





	 



	Revenue
	- Total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $168,573, compared to $17,889 for the three months ended
	September 30, 2015. This resulted in an increase of approximately $150,684 from the comparable period. The increase in revenue
	is primarily a result of collection of 30% of the amount due to the Company under the agreement with Ashita. Information regarding
	the Company’s agreement with Ashita is described in detail below under the Corporate History and ESG Primary Services headings,
	and is incorporated herein by reference. The agreement with Ashita has since been terminated and the loss of revenue from this
	contract may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.




	 




	Revenue
	- Total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $1,239,258, compared to $23,852 for the nine months ended
	September 30, 2015. This resulted in an increase of approximately $1,215,406 from the comparable period. The increase in revenue
	is primarily a result of collection of 30% of the amount due to the Company under the agreement with Ashita identified in the
	preceding paragraph, and more thoroughly discussed under the Corporate History and ESG Primary Services headings.



	 



	Cost
	of Revenue – Cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $188,836, as compared to $5,400 for the three
	months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $188,836 incurred for the labor and website development
	cost associated with contracts entered in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2015 and Q3 of fiscal year 2016. Of the $188,836 cost recognized
	during the three months ended September 30, 2016, $82,790 was for a vendor that is a related party to the Company. As the Company
	maintains a lean workforce with only part-time IT staff, the Company relies on third-party vendors to supply the labour for the
	scope of work associated with our contracts. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also recorded $5,400
	of salaries and wages as general and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, salaries and wages
	of $5,400 was included in cost of revenue.

	months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to $1,104,648 incurred for the labor and website development
	cost associated with contracts entered in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year 2015 and Q3 of fiscal year 2016. Of the $1,104,648 paid
	to vendors, $413,952 was paid to a vendor that is a related party to the Company. As the Company maintains a lean workforce with
	only part-time IT staff, the Company relies on third-party vendors to supply the labour for the scope of work associated with
	our contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company also recorded $16,200 of salaries and wages as general
	and administrative expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, salaries and wages of $7,200 was included in cost
	of revenue.

	Operating
	Expenses - Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $24,047, as compared to $14,861 for the three
	months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase of $9,186 in general and administrative
	expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
	incurred professional fees of $18,446 and $3,686, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2016
	and 2015, the Company recorded stock based compensation of $nil and $4,167, respectively.



	 



	Operating
	Expenses - Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $74,881, as compared to $65,214 for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase of $9,667 in general and administrative expense
	for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the increase of $52,561 in professional fees, $1,839 in franchise tax and
	filing fees and offset by the decrease of $47,252 in stock based compensation, a reversal of $5,000 in consulting fee as a result
	of the termination of a consulting agreement, and of $8,000 in consulting fees. The Company also recorded $16,200 of salaries
	and wages as general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Salaries and wages was included
	in cost of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.



	 



	Gross
	Profit (Loss) – Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was (12.02%) as compared to 69.81% for
	the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenue of $168,573 recognized in
	association with contracts entered in May, September, October of 2015 and Q3 of fiscal 2016 as compared to $17,889 during the
	three months ended September 30, 2015. Of the $168,573 revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, $134,884
	was related to the contract entered in October of 2015. The Company has incurred substantial costs, meaning the majority of a
	contract’s value, in relation to the October 2015 contract as the Company outsourced the labour and website development
	to third party vendors. As a result, the gross profit margin decreased significantly.




	 




	Gross
	Profit (Loss) – Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 10.82% as compared to 69.81% for the

	with contracts entered in May, September, October of 2015 and Q3 of fiscal 2016 as compared to $23,852 during the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015. Of the $1,239,258 revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, $1,162,791 was
	related to the contract entered in October of 2015. The Company has incurred substantial costs, meaning the majority of a contract’s

	Income
	Taxes - Total income tax recovery for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $21,458 compared to $nil for the three months
	ended September 30, 2015. The recovery of $21,458 in income tax expense is primarily a result of over accrual of income tax expenses
	from the six months ended June 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was (48%) which
	was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 34%. The lower tax rate was primarily attributable to the operating loss
	carry forwards from prior fiscal years being utilized and the reversal of over accrued income tax expense as a result of a lower
	estimated annual net income.




	 




	Income
	Taxes - Total income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8,976 compared to $nil for the nine months
	ended September 30, 2015. The increase of $8,976 in income tax expense is primarily a result of significantly higher revenue recognized
	during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in relation to the service agreements entered in the 4th quarter of 2015. The
	effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 15% which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate
	of 34%. The lower tax rate was primarily attributable to the operating loss carry forwards from prior fiscal years being utilized.

	For the
	years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reported a net loss of $31,917 and net loss of $4,828, respectively. The change in
	net loss between the year ended December 31, 2015 and the period from June 23, 2014 was primarily attributable to the revenue
	of $71,241 generated during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $nil during the period from June 23, 2014 (inception)
	through December 31, 2014, offset by $22,600 of costs of revenues and $75,739 of additional operating expenses incurred during
	the year ended December 31, 2015.




	 




	Revenue
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $71,241 compared to $0 for the period from June 23, 2014 (inception) through December
	31, 2014. The increase of $71,241 or 100% was primarily a result of new contracts for business.




	 




	Operating
	Expenses - Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $80,567, as compared to $4,828 for the period from June
	23, 2014 (inception) through December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase of $75,739 in general
	and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the increase of $14,870 in professional fees and the increase
	of $16,000 in consulting fees. The Company also recognized $48,285 of stock based compensation during the year ended December
	31, 2015.

	Liquidity is a measure of our ability to
	meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations and other general business needs. Our liquidity, to
	a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our near-term
	liquidity requirements consist primarily of funding our operations.


	 


	Our long-term liquidity needs primarily
	of funding our operations. We seek to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash flow from operations, and the issuance
	of debt and equity securities. We believe our current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet
	our cash needs for the near future if we do not receive additional funding. It could be necessary to source liquidity from other
	financing alternatives should any such scenario arise. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or
	terms acceptable to us, if at all. In that event, we would be required to change our growth strategy and seek funding on that
	basis, if at all.

	Our
	working capital accounts consist of cash and accounts receivable. Claims against working capital include accounts payable and
	accrued liabilities, amounts due to related parties, and income tax payable. Our working capital may be impacted by factors in
	future periods, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal, such as billings to customers for support services and the subsequent
	collection of those billings. The Company had working capital of $59,401 and $13,540 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
	2015, respectively. 





	 




	The Company does not have adequate or sufficient
	capital resources or liquidity to carry out its business plan. The Company has been funded through its directors and officers,
	and shareholders, and primarily through revenue generated through performance under the agreement with Ashita, which has concluded.
	We intend on relying on future continuous offerings of our equity and/or possible joint ventures with other similarly situated
	companies. There is no guarantee that these efforts will be successful, or result in increased liquidity or capital resources.

	for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $3,203. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related
	to significantly higher revenue generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the timing of collections from our
	customers and the timing of payments to our vendors.


	 


	Net cash provided by operating activities
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $150,374. Net cash used in operating activities for the period from June 23, 2014 (inception)
	to December 31, 2014 was $1,000. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to collection of

	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 




	Our
	financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
	interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported.
	These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
	contingencies, risk and financial condition. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions
	to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected. Significant
	areas requiring the use of estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, and determination of income
	tax expense. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively
	applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
	the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue
	to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.




	 




	We
	believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest
	that our significant accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
	be read in conjunction with this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.




	 





	Accounts
	Receivable






	 





	Accounts
	receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are presented net of the allowance for doubtful
	accounts which represents the Company’s best estimates of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts
	receivable balance. The Company determines allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed
	to be uncollectible and reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis.

	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and IT services. Web and IT services revenues consist of fees from web
	design, software development, domain and hosting, and maintenance and other services. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably
	assured. The Company's service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event
	of cancellations. The Company records revenues net of sales taxes. Revenues from web design, software development are generally
	recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer,
	and the collection is reasonably assured. Revenues from IT consulting services, domain and hosting, and maintenance services are
	generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract.




	 




	The
	Company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development, domain
	and hosting, and maintenance and other services, with the term ranging from one month to two years. The Company analyzes its agreements
	to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance
	with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	605-25, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104,
	“Revenue Recognition”. Allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based
	on the element’s fair value in accordance with ASC 605 and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described
	above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, the Company acted
	as an agent in the transaction. As the agent, it records revenues on a net basis. Customer payments received in advance of the
	performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when the web and
	IT services are rendered.




	 







	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The Company
	accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC 740 requires a company to use the
	asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary
	differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
	between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not
	be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
	enactment.




	 




	Under
	ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would
	be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount
	of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more
	likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
	statements.




	 




	The Company
	calculates the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
	results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when
	identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The estimate
	of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances
	existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, the Company records the change in estimate in
	the period in which the Company make the determination.

	We
	qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
	on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required
	to:




	 






	•
	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
	Act;






	 






	•
	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit
	firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial
	statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);






	 






	•
	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;”
	and






	 






	•
	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance
	and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. 






	   







	 



	In addition,
	Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period
	provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an
	emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
	private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
	may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.




	 




	We will
	remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal
	year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer”
	as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares
	that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter
	or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.




	 




	As an
	emerging growth company, the company is exempt from Section 14A and B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the
	shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes.




	 




	The
	Company is an Emerging Growth Company under the JOBS Act of 2012, but the Company has irrevocably opted out of the extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(B) of the JOBS Act.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	In August
	2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”.
	The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities,
	certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application
	is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
	that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.




	 




	In November
	2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred taxes
	are classified on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified
	as non-current. Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities
	at March 31, 2016 and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December
	31, 2015.




	 




	In February
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based on the principle
	that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly change the
	lessees’ recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from
	the previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The
	effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted.  Management continues to
	assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial statements.




	  




	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
	(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
	of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
	adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
	amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606)”. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
	adoption on its financial statements.




	 




	In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting”. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
	and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
	are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c)
	classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
	on its financial statements.

	and Cornelius Ee our Vice

	16 reporting persons"), to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our Common
	Stock and other equity securities. Section 16 reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all
	Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of any such reports furnished to us, none
	of the Section 16 reporting persons failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
	respect to our most recent fiscal year, and through March 31, 2016.

	do not provide a procedure for shareholders to nominate directors.  The Board of Directors does not currently have a standing
	nominating committee.  The Board of Directors currently has the responsibility of selecting individuals to be nominated for
	election to the Board of Directors.  Qualifications considered by the Directors in nominating an individual may include,
	without limitation, independence, integrity, business experience, education, accounting and financial expertise, reputation, civic,
	community and industry relationships and industry knowledge.  In nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board
	of Directors, the Directors will consider and review an existing director’s Board and Committee attendance, performance

	Audit
	Committee





	 




	As of
	the date of this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Audit Committee.  We intend to establish an Audit Committee of the
	Board of Directors, which will consist of independent directors, of which at least one director will qualify as a qualified financial
	expert as defined in the regulations of the SEC.  The Audit Committee’s duties would be to recommend to our Board
	of Directors the engagement of independent auditors to audit our consolidated financial statements and to review our accounting
	and auditing principles.  The Audit Committee would review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results
	of audit examinations performed by the internal auditors, if any, and independent public accountants, including their recommendations
	to improve the system of accounting and internal control.  The Audit Committee would at all times be composed exclusively
	of directors who are, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, free from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise
	of independent judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted
	accounting principles.  As of the date of this Prospectus, we did not have an audit committee financial expert, in light
	of our size, although we intend to review this issue as the Company grows, especially as the Company implements a standing Audit
	Committee.




	 





	Compensation
	Committee





	 




	As of
	the date of this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Compensation Committee.  We intend to establish a Compensation Committee

	compensation of executive officers.  The Compensation Committee would also administer any stock option plans that we
	may adopt and recommend and approve grants of stock options under such plans.




	 





	Nominating
	and Corporate Governance Committee

	 




	 




	As of
	the date of this Prospectus, we did not have a standing Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  We intend to establish
	a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors to assist in the selection of director nominees, approve
	director nominations to be presented for stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders and fill any vacancies on
	our Board of Directors, consider any nominations of director candidates validly made by stockholders, and review and consider
	developments in corporate governance practices.

	Executive
	Compensation





	 




	Company;
	No other officer receives compensation from the Company. Until the Company acquires additional capital, it is not anticipated
	that any other officer other than these four individuals will receive compensation from the Company other than reimbursement for
	out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Company. The Company has no stock option, retirement, pension, or profit sharing
	programs for the benefit of directors, officers or other employees, but our officers and directors may recommend adoption of one
	or more such programs in the future. We may enter into further agreements following our receipt of additional capital. The Company
	does not have a standing compensation committee, audit committee, nomination committee, or committees performing similar functions.
	 We anticipate that we will form such committees of the Board of Directors once we have a full Board of Directors.

	DESCRIPTION OF
	SECURITIES





	 





	General





	 




	The following
	summary includes a description of material provisions of the Company’s capital stock.




	 





	Authorized Capital Stock





	 




	The authorized
	capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, (hereinafter referred
	to in this section as the “Common Stock”), of which there are 12,000,000 issued and outstanding, and 5,000,000 shares
	of Preferred Stock, (hereinafter referred to in this section as the “Preferred Stock”) par value $.0001 per share,
	of which none have been designated or issued. The following summarizes important information regarding our capital stock.




	 





	Common Stock





	 




	Holders
	of shares of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of
	Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any,
	as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available. In the event of
	a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share pro rata all assets
	remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.
	Holders of Common Stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Company’s Common Stock. There are no conversion or redemption
	rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the Common Stock.




	 





	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	The Board
	of Directors is authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series
	and, by filing a certificate pursuant to the applicable law of Delaware, to establish from time to time the number of shares to
	be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series
	and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof without any further vote or action by the stockholders. Any shares
	of preferred stock so issued would have priority over the Common Stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights. Any future
	issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company without
	further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Common Stock. At present,
	we have no plans to neither issue any preferred stock nor adopt any series, preferences or other classification of preferred stock.




	 




	The issuance
	of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition
	proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting
	rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights
	that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred
	stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Common Stock. Although the Board of Directors is required
	to make any determination to issue such stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our stockholders, the Board of
	Directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of
	the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock
	over the then market price of such stock. The Board of Directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior
	to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or stock exchange rules. We have no present plans
	to issue any preferred stock.




	 




	The description
	of certain matters relating to the securities of the Company is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of
	our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement on Form
	10 filed with the SEC on July 7, 2014.



	 








	-

	Dividends





	 




	We have
	not paid any dividends on our Common Stock and do not presently intend to pay cash dividends prior to the consummation of a business
	combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future, if any, will be contingent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital
	requirements and general financial condition subsequent to consummation of a business combination, if any. The payment of any
	dividends subsequent to a business combination, if any, will be within the discretion of our then existing Board of Directors.
	It is the present intention of our Board of Directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and,
	accordingly, the Board of Directors does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 




	 





	Pre-emptive
	Rights





	 




	Holders
	of Common Stock are not entitled to pre-emptive or subscription or conversion rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund
	provisions applicable to the Common Stock.




	 





	Share
	Purchase Warrants





	 




	We have
	not issued and do not have outstanding any warrants to purchase Common Stock.




	 





	Options





	 




	We have
	not issued and do not have outstanding any options to purchase Common Stock.




	 





	Convertible
	Securities





	 




	The
	Company entered into a convertible note with Mr. Ee Chang Ku, a director and shareholder of EliteSoft Asia, a shareholder and
	affiliate of the Company, in the amount of $50,000. The loan proceeds were received by the Company in May of 2015. The advance
	is unsecured, bears no interest, contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common
	stock; however, the parties have not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015.
	The loan is not yet convertible as the shares are not publicly traded on an exchange. The shares associated with the potential
	conversion are not being registered herein. We have not issued any other convertible securities, and do not have any other outstanding
	any securities convertible into common shares or any rights convertible or exchangeable into common stock.




	 









	Trading
	of Securities in Secondary Market





	 




	The Company
	presently has 12,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, all of which are “restricted securities,”
	as that term is defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, in that such shares were issued in private transactions
	not involving a public offering. This Prospectus, and the Registration Statement of which it is a part, registers the resale by
	the Selling Shareholders of all 12,000,000 shares of the Common Stock, constituting 100% of the shares held by the Selling Shareholders.
	Following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this Prospectus is a part, we plan to apply for quotation of
	our securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES





	 




	In
	accordance with the provisions in our articles of incorporation, we will indemnify an officer, director, or former officer or
	director, to the full extent permitted by law.




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling
	persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event
	that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities mother than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
	officer or controlling person of us in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding is asserted by such director,
	officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
	indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication
	of such issue.






	 










	CERTAIN
	RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS












	 





	The Company
	is seeking the registration of 4,000,000 shares of Common Stock titled to our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and
	President, Mr. Wong. Our Assistant Secretary, Finny Fung Lin Chu, is married to Mr. Wong.




	 




	In
	February 2015, Mr. Ee Chang Ku has advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured,
	bears no interest, contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management
	has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015. The loan is not yet convertible
	as the shares are not publicly traded on an exchange. The shares associated with the potential conversion are not being registered
	herein. Mr. Ee Chang Ku is a director, shareholder and control party of EliteSoft Asia, which is an affiliate of the Company.




	  




	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2015, Mr. Ee loaned the Company $3,331 for general operating expenses. The loan is unsecured,
	non-interest bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owed $3,331 to Mr. Ee.




	 







	During 2015, the Company entered
	into a six month service contract with ESA to provide the Company with website design, development and integration with the Company’s
	CRM Program as well as web-based automated tracking system for the Company’s nationwide operations ?customer relation management
	program.  The total contract value is approximately $414,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company

	The
	Company was incorporated on June 23, 2014. The Selling Shareholders were issued their respective shares, and assumed their respective
	director and officer positions following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement between EliteSoft Asia and Mr. Chiang on
	February 20, 2015 (the “SPA”). EliteSoft Asia appointed Mr. Wong as the sole member of the Board of Directors, and
	Mr. Wong appointed himself as Chairman of the Board of Directors, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Wong appointed Ms.
	Khoo Mae Ling as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Mr. Cornelius Ee as Vice President of Information Technology. In consideration
	for serving in these positions as designees of EliteSoft Asia, EliteSoft Asia issued 3,000,000 shares of the Company titled to
	EliteSoft Asia through the SPA to Mr. Cornelius Ee, 4,000,000 shares to Mr. Wong and 3,000,000 shares to Ms. Khoo Mae Ling. As
	a result of these issuances, EliteSoft Asia held no shares of common stock in the Company. Neither Mr. Wong, Mr. Cornelius Ee
	nor Ms. Khoo Mae Ling are directors, officers or shareholders of EliteSoft Asia.




	 




	Once
	the registration statement of which this Prospectus is part becomes effective with the SEC, and once a public market develops,
	the Selling Shareholders may sell the shares indicated above in public transactions or otherwise, on the OTC Bulletin Board (or
	such other public market as may develop) or in privately negotiated transactions. Those public resales may be at the fixed price
	of $0.10.  The Selling Shareholders act independently of one another in making a determination to sell the shares owned by
	them and they do not act as or form a group for purposes of their ownership or disposition of the shares offered hereunder. There
	is no guarantee that a public market in the common stock will develop in the future.

	SHARES
	ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE





	 




	As of
	the date of this Prospectus, there are 12,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding of which 12,000,000 shares are owned by officers
	and directors of the Company, or affiliates thereof. There will be 12,000,000 shares outstanding if the maximum number of Shares
	offered herein is sold. The shares of common stock held by current shareholders are considered “restricted securities”
	subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In general, securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after
	being fully-paid and held for more than 12 months. While affiliates of the Company are subject to certain limits in the amount
	of restricted securities they can sell under Rule 144, there are no such limitations on sales by persons who are not affiliates
	of the Company. In the event non-affiliated holders elect to sell such shares in the public market, there is likely to be a negative
	effect on the market price of the Company’s securities.





	 









	USE
	OF PROCEEDS





	 




	All of
	the shares herein, if and when sold, are being offered and sold by the Selling Shareholders or their pledgees, donees, transferees
	or other successors in interest.  We will not receive any proceeds from those sales.






	 










	PLAN
	OF DISTRIBUTION





	 




	This
	Prospectus relates to the resale of up to 12,000,000 Shares held by the Selling Shareholders as described above. Once the registration
	statement of which this Prospectus is part becomes effective, the Selling Shareholders, and any of their pledges, donees, assignees
	and other successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their shares on any stock exchange, market or trading
	facility on which the shares are traded, or in private transactions. Those sales to the public are to be fixed at $0.10 per share,
	and may be at negotiated prices in private sales. The Selling Shareholders may use any one or more of the following methods when
	selling shares:




	 










	• ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer solicits purchasers;






	• block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as agent, but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;






	• purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for its account;






	• an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;






	• privately negotiated transactions;






	• broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Shareholders to sell a specified number of such shares;






	• through the writing of options on the shares;






	• a combination of any such methods of sale; and






	• any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.

	The Selling
	Shareholders or their pledges, donees, transferees or other successors in interest, may also sell the shares directly to market
	makers acting as principals and/or broker-dealers acting as agents for themselves or their customers. Such broker-dealers may
	receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the Selling Shareholders and/or the purchasers
	of shares for whom such broker-dealers may act as agents or to whom they sell as principal or both, which compensation as to a
	particular broker-dealer might be in excess of customary commissions.




	 




	Market
	makers and block purchasers purchasing the shares will do so for their own account and at their own risk. It is possible that
	the Selling Shareholders will attempt to sell shares in block transactions to market makers or other purchasers. The Selling Shareholders
	cannot assure that all or any of the shares offered in this Prospectus will be sold by the Selling Shareholders. In addition,
	the Selling Shareholders and any brokers, dealers or agents, upon effecting the sale of any of the shares offered in this Prospectus
	are “underwriters” as that term is defined under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or the rules and regulations
	under such acts. In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the
	shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.




	 




	Discounts,
	concessions, commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, attributable to the sale of shares will be borne by the Selling
	Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders may agree to indemnify any agent, dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions
	involving sales of the Shares if liabilities are imposed on that person under the Securities Act.



	 







	The Selling
	Shareholders may from time to time pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of their shares and, if it defaults in the
	performance of its secured obligations, the pledgee or secured parties may offer and sell the shares from time to time under this
	Prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or any other applicable provision of the Securities
	Act amending the list of Selling Shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as a Selling
	Shareholders under this Prospectus.




	 




	The Selling
	Shareholders also may transfer the shares in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other successors
	in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of this Prospectus and may sell the shares from time to time under
	this Prospectus after we have filed an amendment to this Prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or other applicable provision of the
	Securities Act amending the list of Selling Shareholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in interest as
	a Selling Shareholders under this Prospectus.

	As noted
	above, each Selling Shareholders is an “underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with the
	sale of our common stock under this Prospectus. We will pay all expenses incident to the registration, offering and sale of the
	shares to the public hereunder other than commissions, fees and discounts of underwriters, brokers, dealers and agents of the
	Selling Shareholders. If any of these other expenses exists, we expect the applicable Selling Shareholder to pay these expenses.




	 




	The Selling
	Shareholders acquired the shares offered hereby in the ordinary course of business and they have advised us that they have not
	entered into any agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters or broker-dealers regarding the sale of the
	shares, nor is there an underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with a proposed sale of shares by the Selling
	Shareholders. We will file a supplement to this Prospectus if the Selling Shareholders enter into a material arrangement with
	a broker-dealer for sale of common stock being registered. If the Selling Shareholders use this Prospectus for any sale of the
	shares, it will be subject to the Prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.

	to a requirement by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, the maximum commission or discount to be received by
	any FINRA member or independent broker/dealer may not be greater than eight percent of the gross proceeds received by the Selling
	Stockholders for the sale of any securities being registered pursuant to SEC Rule 415 under the Securities Act.




	 




	The anti-manipulation
	rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, may apply to sales of Shares and activities of the Selling Shareholders. The Selling
	Shareholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale.

	Corporate
	History





	 




	The
	Company’s predecessor-in-name - ANDES 3, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 23, 2014. On February 20,
	2015, EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd (“Elite Soft Asia”) purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock $40,000
	pursuant to a privately negotiated purchase pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement with Richard Chiang (the “SPA”).
	The closing of the SPA resulted in the sale of all issued and outstanding shares of the Company. Effective upon the closing date
	of the Share Purchase Agreement, Mr. Chiang owned no shares of the Company’s stock, and EliteSoft Asia was the sole stockholder
	of the Company.





	 




	Elite Soft Asia proceeded to vote
	its shares in approving a change in ownership and the amendment to its articles of incorporation on March 16, 2015 changing the
	name of the Company to “EliteSoft Global Inc.” The change of ownership was effected through EliteSoft Asia electing
	Eugene Wong as the sole director of the Company. Immediately following his election, Mr. Wong accepted the resignation of Mr.
	Chiang as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Chiang’s
	resignation was in connection with the closing of the SPA, and was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any
	matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.

	 


	Elite
	Soft Asia also transferred its 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to three directors, with Mr. Wong receiving
	4,000,000 shares, and Cornelius Ee and Khoo Mae Ling receiving 3,000,000 shares each. 



	 







	Immediately
	following his election, Mr. Wong accepted the resignation of Mr. Chiang as the Company’s President, Chief Executive Officer,
	Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Chiang’s resignation was in connection with the closing of the SPA,
	and was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.






	Following
	Mr. Chiang’s resignation, and effective as of the same date, to fill the vacancies created by his resignation, Mr. Wong,
	acting as the sole member of the Board of Directors, appointed himself as Chairman of the Board of Directors, President, and Chief
	Executive Officer. He also appointed Khoo Mae Ling as Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Cornelius Ee as Vice President
	of Information Technology. In consideration for serving in these positions as designees of EliteSoft Asia, EliteSoft Asia issued
	3,000,000 shares of the Company titled to EliteSoft Asia through the SPA to Mr. Cornelius Ee, 4,000,000 shares to Mr. Wong and
	3,000,000 shares to Ms. Khoo Mae Ling. As a result of these issuances, EliteSoft Asia held no shares of common stock in the Company.
	However, as set forth below, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to EliteSoft Asia on June 1, 2015
	as consideration under an Assignment and Assumption Agreement.




	 




	We
	currently generate revenue by providing web and IT services for several clients. On June 1, 2015, the Company entered into an
	Assignment Assumption Agreement with Elite Soft Asia (the “Assignment Agreement”). Under the Assignment Agreement,
	we acquired the NZ Financial Limited Technology Services Agreement (the “NZ Agreement”) from Elite Soft Asia in consideration
	for 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock. Under the NZ Agreement, we support NZ Financials’ initiatives
	in developing, designing, and maintaining its e-commerce website, create its corporate image, supply necessary computer hardware
	equipment, monitor server, and develop social media strategies. In exchange, NZ Financial pays the Company $2,000 per month. The
	NZ Agreement earned $14,000 in gross revenue in fiscal year 2015 under this agreement.



	 







	Also
	on June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Technology Services Agreement with YouthliteSdnBhd (the “Youthlite Agreement”).
	Youthlite is a natural skin care and cosmetics company based in Malaysia. Under the Youthlite Agreement, we are responsible for
	the following: (a) Creation and design of corporate images and materials, (b) Design and development of the Youthlite website,
	(c) Development of e-commerce software for sales transactions, (d) Provide required computer hardware to operate its online business,
	(e) 24/7 server monitoring, (f) Create social media strategy via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, (g) Provide video production services
	for infomercials. In exchange for these services, Youthlite pays the Company $3,963 per month. The Company earned $27,714 in gross
	revenue in fiscal year 2015 under the Youthlite Agreement.



	 









	On
	September 1, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with OD Alliance Sdn Bhd. to provide technical software, development
	and web maintenance. The agreement term is for two years and carries a contract value of $32,500. Services commenced on October
	1, 2015 and will continue through October 1, 2017, subject to renewal with written consent from both parties. Under the agreement,
	the Company is to be paid $12,500 for website design and development, $2,000 per year for domain hosting, and $2,000 per year
	for system maintenance. The Company earned $14,500 in gross revenue in fiscal year 2015 under this agreement, and generated accounts

	integration, rebranding, development of web-based automated tracking system, system and web maintenance, and web-based training
	services. The agreement term is for two years and carries a contract value of $1,453,490. Services commenced on October 15, 2015
	and will continue through October 14, 2017, subject to renewal with written consent from both parties. The Company earned $0 in
	gross revenue in fiscal year 2015 under this agreement.

	All of the Company’s obligations under this contract have
	since been completed.






	 





	On
	October 19, 2015, the Company, entered into an agreement with MPS Telecommunication Sdn Bhd. to provide technical software, development

	$15,000 in gross revenue in fiscal year 2015 under this agreement.




	  




	The Company
	maintains a lean workforce with only part-time IT staff. Therefore, we rely on third-party vendors to supply the labour for the
	scope of work associated with our contracts. Cornelius Ee is an IT graduate. Therefore, he supervises the entire project to ensure
	timely completion of work from third-party vendors. However, the actual day-to-day tasks and projects are done almost exclusively
	by third-party vendors who contract with the Company.




	 

	 





	Our
	market opportunity is in Asia and in particular, countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and
	China. We also find that markets in New Zealand and Australia are favorable to our industry as well. Our primary goals are to
	become the leading IT services company in Asia with a strong focus on the financial sector, e-commerce, business-web-based training
	and certification.

	Company has limited resources to dedicate exclusively to research and development. The Company has spent less than $5,000 on internal
	research and development activities. Major contracts have been outsourced to third-party vendors, including OD Alliance and EliteSoft
	Asia, a related party and affiliate of the Company. These vendors provide the Company with necessary consultancy, technical knowledge
	and content for our contracts. As a result, the Company relies on the third-party vendors in performing its contracts. Mr. Cornelius
	Ee, the Company’s Vice President of Information Technology, is instrumental in coordinating with and supervising third-party
	vendors in order to complete work in a timely manner in order to comply with the Company’s contractual obligations. In the
	event one of our third-party vendors terminates its relationship with the Company, the Company may be at risk of not fully performing
	its contractual obligations to its customers. All amounts paid to third-party vendors are accounted for in our financials.




	 





	Industry, Competition,
	and Future Operations






	The IT web, System Integration
	and Application Solutions Industry





	 




	The
	IT web, systems integration and applications solutions market is a highly fragmented industry. There are numerous companies that
	have established businesses and command large market share, such as Accenture, BAE Systems, Cognizant Technology, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard,
	IBM, Infosys, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Tata Consultancy that we compete against. We also compete with Alibaba, eBay, Amazon, Rakuten,
	Groupon, ASOS, Expedia and other e-commerce platform companies specifically in our e-commerce business in the Asia-Pacific region.
	Additionally, many of the vendor companies that the industry purchases products from may compete against their clients by offering
	full life cycle solutions and packages that support compatible software and hardware products, a role that IT web and system integrators
	normally play, therefore, emerging companies in our industry have taken to a full solution approach that offers clients a robust,
	'best of breed' and customized software programming with a higher emphasis on customer service relations. Additionally, in the
	Asia-Pacific markets, companies offer other options such as managing payroll, and accounting as well as recruitment and human
	resources on behalf of clients to further differentiate themselves from competitors. According to Transparency Market Research
	in 2014, the firm believes that the global market for system integration services was valued at $191.36 billion in 2013, and is
	expected to reach $377.59 billion by 2020, growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 10.9% during the period. Their assessment
	of the industry was that the Asia Pacific region was expected to be the fastest growing regional market for system integration,
	during the forecasted period. The rapidly growing economies of the Asia-Pacific region and globalization of firms are key drivers
	in propelling demand for the IT, system integration and services business.




	 




	Our
	company has developed a strategy that will encompass a broader approach to traditional IT web and system integration by focusing
	efforts on the emerging mobile payment industry. Our approach is to offer our clients full mobile payment integration with their
	IT strategy and developing a competitive mobile solution to their commerce needs. According to McKinsey, a global business consultancy
	firm, the Asia-Pacific region will account for more than 50% of the global payments growth over the next five years and cashless
	transactions will increase by more than 20% growth in countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and China.

	Competition





	 




	The
	mobile payments industry in the Asia-Pacific region is highly competitive. Given the outlook in the Asia-Pacific region, we believe
	that competition for revenues will intensify. In the mobile payments space, we compete with stand-alone players such as PayPal,
	Netteller, China Union Pay, AliPay, and BitPay, additionally, we compete with three categories of institutional players, Non-Bank
	payment companies, Asia-Pacific banks in home markets, and Banks in non-home markets.




	 




	Non-Bank
	payment companies are telecom or "telco" companies, that are seeking to expand their existing technologies by offering
	mobile payment solutions integrated into mobile phones and consumer machines such as ticketing services. Asia-Pacific banks are
	banks in home markets in Asia such as HSBC, Citi, and Standard Chartered. These banking institutions seek to increase their footprint
	with clients by offering mobile bank payment solutions in order to capture more revenue.




	 





	Banks in non-home markets are banks outside the Asia-Pacific region that offer competitive services
	with the objective to increase cash management services through either low cost fees or no fee accounts. These banks are generally
	the least sophisticated members of the current competitive landscape based upon their inexperience in operating within the Asia-Pacific
	region, however, the amount of financial resources these banks control are formidable.





	 







	Employees





	 




	As
	of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of three people. The Company considers its relationship with its employees to be stable,
	and anticipates growing its workforce.




	 





	Involvement in Certain
	Legal Proceedings






	 




	None of our officer nor directors, promoters or control persons have been involved in the past ten
	years in any of the following:




	 




	(1) Any
	bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at
	the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;




	(2) Any
	conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
	minor offenses);




	(3)
	Being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, or any court of competent jurisdiction,
	permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities
	or banking activities; or





	(4) Being
	found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
	have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 





	 Trading Market





	 




	Currently,
	there is no trading market for the securities of the Company. The Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation
	of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible, which may be while this offering is still in process. There can
	be no assurance that the Company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. See “RISK FACTORS”
	and “DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES”.

	Jumpstart
	Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act





	 




	The
	disclosure contained below, discusses generally the terms of the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act”. In April,
	2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other
	things:



	 















	•
	Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years
	and provides a new form of financing to small companies;





	 


	 


	 





	•
	Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold
	number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;





	 


	 


	 





	•
	Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;





	 


	 


	 





	•
	Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and





	 


	 


	 





	•
	Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with
	rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such sales are exempt from state law registration,
	documentation or offering requirements.







	 











	In
	general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common
	equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues
	during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of:




	 




	(i)
	the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,




	 




	(ii)
	the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;




	 




	(iii)
	the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or




	 




	(iv)
	the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.




	 




	The
	Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company will be affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and
	certain of the new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and
	for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.




	 





	Financial
	Disclosure

	. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities
	Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:




	 




	(i)
	audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;




	 




	(ii)
	selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;




	 




	(iii)
	executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller
	reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second
	fiscal quarter)




	 




	Notwithstanding,
	the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions
	for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required
	to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two
	most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.




	 




	The
	JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted
	by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except
	as otherwise required by SEC rule. The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB
	for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.




	 









	-

	44

	-
















	 







	Internal
	Control Attestation

	. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered
	public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management
	of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



	 



	Section
	102(a) of the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies from the requirements in 1934 Act Section 14A(e) for companies
	with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.




	 





	Other
	Items of the JOBS Act

	. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors
	that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either
	prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker
	or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision.
	In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers,
	dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth
	company IPO.




	 




	Section
	106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided
	that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.
	This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that
	it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to
	conduct a road show.




	 





	Election
	to Opt Out of Transition Period.

	Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to
	comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act
	registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to
	comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended
	transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt
	out is irrevocable.

	DISCLOSURE
	OF COMMISSION POSITION ON INDEMNIFICATION






	FOR
	SECURITIES ACT LIABILITIES





	 




	Subsection
	(a) of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who
	was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether
	civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the
	fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation
	as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
	expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
	him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be
	in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
	cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.




	 




	Subsection
	(b) of Section 145 empowers a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
	any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of
	the fact that such person acted in any of the capacities set forth above, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually
	and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and
	in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification
	may be made in respect to any claim issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
	unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine
	upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
	fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.




	 




	Section
	145 further provides that to the extent a director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise
	in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 145 or in the defense
	of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and
	reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith; that the indemnification provided for by Section 145 shall not be deemed exclusive
	of any other rights which the indemnified party may be entitled; that indemnification provided by Section 145 shall, unless otherwise
	provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
	shall inure to the benefit of such person’s heirs, executors and administrators; and empowers the corporation to purchase
	and maintain insurance on behalf of a director or officer of the corporation against any liability asserted against him and incurred
	by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
	him against such liabilities under Section 145.




	 




	Section
	102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law or the State of Delaware provides that a certificate of incorporation may contain a provision
	eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
	of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of the director (i) for
	any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good
	faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.




	 




	Article
	X of our Charter provides that, “to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, a director of
	this corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty
	as a director.”




	 




	Article
	XI, Section 1(c) of our Bylaws further provides that “Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made
	a party or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
	of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer, of the
	Corporation shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General
	Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.”




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, or persons controlling
	the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Company has been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	September 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	1.   


	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	EliteSoft Global Inc.,
	(the “Company”, or “EliteSoft Global”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on June 23, 2014. The
	Company was formerly known as ANDES 3 Inc. and changed its name to EliteSoft Global Inc. on March 23, 2015. The Company currently
	generates revenue by providing web and IT services to a limited number of clients. The Company provides the following services:
	(a) Creation and design of corporate images and materials, (b) Website design and development, (c) Development of e-commerce software
	for sales transactions, (d) Supplying required computer hardware to operate online businesses, (e) 24/7 server monitoring, (f)
	Creation of social media strategies via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and (g) Video production services for infomercials.


	 



	2.   

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT POLICES




	  



	Basis
	of Presentation

	 – The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s
	most recent Annual Financial Statements filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015. In the opinion of management, all
	adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results
	of operations for the interim period presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are
	not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially
	duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the
	Form 10-K, have been omitted.


	 



	Use of estimates

	 –
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	(“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and judgments
	are based on historical information, information that is currently available to the Company and on various other assumptions that
	the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash and cash equivalents

	 –
	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
	Cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds. The carrying
	value of those investments approximates fair value.


	 




	 






	F-

	Accounts receivable

	– Accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, and are stated at the
	amount the Company expects to collect from outstanding balances. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based
	on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. Management considers accounts receivable to be fully
	collectible at September 30, 2016.


	 



	Revenue recognition

	– The Company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and IT services. Web and IT services revenues consist
	of fees from web design, software development, domain and hosting, and maintenance and other services. The Company recognizes
	revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and
	collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds
	to customers in the event of cancellations. The Company records revenues net of sales taxes. Revenues from web design, software
	development are generally recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise
	transfers to the customer, and the collection is reasonably assured. Revenues from IT consulting services, domain and hosting,
	and maintenance services are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract.


	 


	The Company also enters
	into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development, domain and hosting, and
	maintenance and other services, with the term ranging from one month to two years. The Company analyzes its agreements to determine
	whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the
	Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-25,
	“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, “Revenue
	Recognition”. Allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based on the element’s
	fair value in accordance with ASC 605 and related revenues are recognized pursuant to the criteria described above. During the
	year ended December 31, 2015, in one of the arrangements that contain multiple deliverables, the Company acted as an agent in
	the transaction. As the agent, it records revenues on a net basis. Customer payments received in advance of the performance of
	services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when the web and IT services are
	rendered.


	 



	Cost of revenues

	– Cost of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and IT services for its clients
	and primarily consists of subcontracted services.


	 



	Earnings (loss) per
	share

	 – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders
	by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed
	by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
	the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially
	dilutive securities had been issued. At September 30, 2016, the Company had a $50,000 loan from a stockholder which is convertible
	on demand. Management has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at September 30, 2016.


	 




	 






	F-

	Stock-based compensation

	 –
	The Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees
	in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10, “Compensation- Stock Compensation”, and FASB ASC 505-50, “Equity- Based
	Payments to Non-Employees”. Costs are measured at the estimated fair value of the consideration received or the estimated
	fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the equity instruments issued
	for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance
	by the provider of goods or services.


	 



	Related parties

	– A related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company’s securities and their
	immediate families, (ii) the Company's management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is
	under common control with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of
	the Company. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations
	between related parties.


	 



	Income taxes

	 –
	The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
	existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
	Accounting standards regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation
	allowance, if based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly,
	the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on a more-likely-than-not
	realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative
	losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Company’s experience with
	operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.


	 


	The Company recorded
	valuation allowances on the net deferred tax assets. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax assets based on
	the accounting standards for income taxes each reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of operations improve
	and it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to reduce the valuation
	allowance.


	 


	Significant judgment
	is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During the ordinary
	course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting
	standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.
	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it
	is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,
	if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely, based solely on the
	technical merits, of being sustained on examinations. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax
	positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.


	 




	 






	F-

	Fair value of financial
	instruments

	– The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial
	liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
	statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques
	used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
	assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs
	(Level 3 measurements). The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:


	 


	Level 1 – Inputs
	are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
	at the measurement date.


	 


	Level 2 – Inputs
	are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or
	indirectly.


	 


	Level 3 – Inputs
	are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.


	 


	The Company does not
	have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis. For certain of the
	Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
	amounts due to related parties and income tax payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities.


	 


	Transactions involving
	related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free
	market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related
	party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations
	can be substantiated. It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due from/to related parties due to
	their related party nature.


	  



	Foreign currency transactions
	and translation

	– The Company records and settles all transactions in U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate
	prevailing at each transaction date, therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included
	in accumulated other comprehensive income.


	 



	Accounting standards
	note yet adopted

	-

	In August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”. The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective
	date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee
	benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process
	of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.



	 




	 






	F-

	In November 2015 the
	FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred taxes are classified
	on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December
	15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current.
	Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has no deferred tax assets and liabilities at September
	30, 2016 and recorded a valuation allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December 31, 2015.


	 


	In February 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based on the principle that
	entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly change the lessees’
	recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from
	the previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The
	effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted.  Management continues to
	assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial statements.


	  


	In March 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
	Revenue Gross versus Net)”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability of
	the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and adding
	additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these amendments
	is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”.
	Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”.
	The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
	those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including:
	(a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement
	of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.


	 




	 






	F-

	In April 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.”
	The amendments in this ASU clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing
	implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The effective date and transition of these amendments
	is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”.
	Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 


	In May 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.”
	The amendments in this ASU affect only the narrow aspects of Topic 606. The effective date and transition of these amendments
	is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”.
	Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial
	statements.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
	Instruments.” The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology
	that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to
	inform credit loss estimates. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on
	its financial statements.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB
	issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus
	of the Emerging Issues Task Force). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the
	statement of cash flows. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. Management
	continues to assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company’s financial statements.


	 


	The Company has implemented
	all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe
	that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial
	position or results of operations.

	GOING CONCERN



	 	


	The accompanying unaudited
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
	of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has retained earnings of $14,116 as of September 30, 2016. The Company
	requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital
	through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of
	the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
	are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
	that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

	5.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	In February 2015, a Company
	stockholder advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured, bears no interest, contains
	no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management has not determined the
	conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at September 30, 2016. The Loan is not yet convertible as the shares are
	not publicly traded on an exchange.


	 


	During the quarter ended
	September 30, 2015, Mr. Cornelius Ee, Vice President of the Company, advanced the Company $3,331 for general operating expenses.
	The advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owed
	$3,331 (December 31, 2015 - $3,331) to Mr. Cornelius Ee.


	 


	During 2015, the Company
	entered into a six-month service contract with ELITESOFT ASIA PTE LTD, a shareholder of the Company, to provide the Company with
	website design, development and integration with the Company’s CRM Program as well as web-based automated tracking system
	for the Company’s nationwide operations –customer relation management program. The total contract value is approximately
	$414,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred cost of $413,952 under this contract. Included

	6.   

	STOCKHOLDERS’
	EQUITY



	 



	Preferred Stock 

	–
	The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, no shares of
	preferred stock had been issued.


	 



	Common Stock

	 -
	The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value common stock. As of September 30, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, 12,000,000 and 12,250,000 shares were issued and outstanding, respectively.


	 





	On
	March 23, 2016, the Company cancelled 250,000 shares of common stock of the Company that had been previously issued due to termination
	of consulting agreement dated May 1, 2015 and reversed stock-based compensation of $5,000 that was recognized during the year
	ended December 31, 2015. Since the fair value of the award was charged to consulting expense in fiscal 2015, the $5,000 reversal
	of such stock-based compensation in fiscal 2016 is credited to consulting expense.  





	 


	7.   

	CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION

	 


	During the nine months
	ended September 30, 2016, the Company generated revenues from seven customers and one major customer accounted for 94% of the
	Company’s revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues. The accounts receivable from the major customer
	was 0% of the total accounts receivable. The accounts receivable from four of the other six customers accounted for more than
	96% of total accounts receivable. The loss of the major customer could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business,
	operating results, or financial condition.


	 


	8.   

	INCOME TAXES

	 


	The Company computes
	the income tax expense by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date income (loss) from operations and adding
	the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period.


	 





	The
	Company’s effective tax rate was (48%) and 15% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which
	was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 34%. The lower tax rate was primarily attributable to the net operating
	loss carry forwards from prior fiscal years being utilized and the reversal of over accrued income tax expense as a result of
	a lower estimated annual net income.







	 


	9.   

	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	Management has evaluated
	subsequent events up to and including November 14, 2016, which is the date the statements were available for issuance and determined
	there are no reportable subsequent events.

	REPORT

	To the
	Board of Directors and Shareholders of




	EliteSoft
	Global, Inc.,




	 




	We have
	audited the accompanying balance sheet of Elitesoft Global, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2015, and the
	related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these financial statements based on our audit.




	 




	We conducted
	our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
	significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial
	statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EliteSoft Global, Inc. as of
	December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2, the
	Company has incurred recurring losses since inception, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue
	as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not
	include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	3, Inc.






	 





	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Andes 3, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014, and the related
	statements of operations, change in stockholders’ deficit and statement of cash flows for the period from June 23, 2014
	(Inception) to December 31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not required
	to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration
	of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
	but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
	in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
	Company as of December 31, 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from June 23, 2014 (Inception)
	to December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial
	statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since inception. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt
	about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described
	in Note 3, which includes the raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity. The financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Note
	1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS

	Our
	primary goals are to become the leading IT services company in Asia with a strong focus on the financial sector, e-commerce, business-web-based
	training and certification.




	 




	Note
	2 –SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	accompanying audited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	 





	Concentrations





	 




	The
	Company deposits cash with a national bank within the United States of America and at times throughout the year may maintain balances
	that exceed federally insured limits of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank. There was no uninsured cash at December 31,
	2015 or 2014. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes the Company is not exposed
	to any unusual credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
	results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
	Cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are primarily in money market funds. The carrying
	value of those investments approximates fair value.



	 





	Accounts
	Receivable





	 




	Accounts
	receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms, and are stated at the amount the Company expects
	to collect from outstanding balances. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified
	amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. Management considers accounts receivable to be fully collectible at December 31,
	2015.




	 









	F-

	19


















	 






	Revenue
	Recognition





	 




	The
	Company derives its revenues primarily from providing web and IT services. Web and IT services revenues consist of fees from web
	design, software development, domain and hosting, and maintenance and other services. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably
	assured. The Company's service arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not provide for refunds to customers in the event
	of cancellations. The Company records revenues net of sales taxes. Revenues from web design, software development are generally
	recognized after the projects are completed and when delivery is made or title and risk of loss otherwise transfers to the customer,
	and the collection is reasonably assured. Revenues from IT consulting services, domain and hosting, and maintenance services are
	generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the contract.  




	 






	The
	Company also enters into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include web design and software development, domain
	and hosting, and maintenance and other services, with the term ranging from one month to two years. The Company analyzes its agreements
	to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting in accordance
	with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	605-25, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” and Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104,
	“Revenue Recognition”. Allocation of revenue to individual elements that qualify for separate accounting is based
	on the

	element’s fair value in accordance with ASC 605 and related revenues are recognized
	pursuant to the criteria described above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, in one of the arrangements that contain multiple
	deliverables, the Company acted as an agent in the transaction. As the agent, it records revenues on a net basis. Customer payments
	received in advance of the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues in the balance sheets, and are recognized
	as revenue when the web and IT services are rendered.






	 














	Cost
	of Revenues





	 




	Cost
	of revenues includes all costs associated with the providing website development and IT services for its clients and primarily
	consists of subcontracted services.




	 





	Earnings
	(loss) per share





	 




	Basic
	earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
	number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
	available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased
	to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities
	had been issued. At December 31, 2015, the Company had a $50,000 note payable which is convertible on demand. Management has not
	determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015.





	 









	F-

	20


















	 






	Stock-based
	compensation





	 




	The
	Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance
	with FASB ASC 718-10, Compensation- Stock Compensation, and FASB ASC 505-50, Equity- Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are
	measured at the estimated fair value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued,
	whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of the equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services
	is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services.




	 





	Related
	Parties






	 





	A
	related party is generally defined as (i) any person that holds 10% or more of the Company's securities and their immediate families,
	(ii) the Company's management, (iii) someone that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control
	with the Company, or (iv) anyone who can significantly influence the financial and operating decisions of the Company. A transaction
	is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources or obligations between related parties.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic No. 740, “Income Taxes.” ASC Topic No. 740, requires
	a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for
	deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
	are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced
	by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred
	tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
	on the date of enactment.




	 




	Under
	ASC Topic No. 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position
	would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest
	amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more
	likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.




	 




	Management
	has analyzed the Company’s material tax positions and has determined that no material uncertain tax positions exist that
	require recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements.




	 









	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
	value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
	basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to valuation techniques used to measure fair
	value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
	(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:




	 




	Level
	1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the
	ability to access at the measurement date.




	 




	Level
	2 – Inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability,
	either directly or indirectly.




	 




	Level
	3 – Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.









	F-

	21

















	 



	 



	The
	Company does not have any financial assets or liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis. For
	certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts
	payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenue, the carrying amounts approximate fair values due to their short maturities.




	 




	Transactions
	involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
	freemarket dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the
	related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
	representations can be substantiated. It is not, however, practical to determine the fair value of amounts due from/to related
	parties due to their related party nature.




	  





	Foreign
	Currency Transactions and Translation





	 




	The
	Company records and settles all transactions in U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each transaction
	date, therefore there are no translation adjustments at the balance sheet date that should be included in accumulated other comprehensive
	income.




	 





	Accounting
	Standards Not Yet Adopted





	 




	In
	August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date”.
	The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities,
	certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application
	is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within
	that reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.




	 




	In
	November 2015 the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”, which changes how deferred
	taxes are classified on the Company’s balance sheets and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities
	to be classified as non-current. Upon adoption, we anticipate no effect on our balances sheets as the Company has recorded a valuation
	allowance reducing our net deferred tax assets and liabilities to zero at December 31, 2015 and 2014.




	 




	In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases.  This ASU is based
	on the principle that entities should recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases.  The ASU does not significantly
	change the lessees’ recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows from the previous accounting standard.  Leases
	are classified as finance or operating.  The ASU’s primary change is the requirement for entities to recognize
	a lease liability for payments and a right of use asset representing the right to use the leased asset during the term on operating
	lease arrangements.  Lessees are permitted to make an accounting policy election to not recognize the asset and liability
	for leases with a term of twelve months or less.  Lessors’ accounting under the ASC is largely unchanged from
	the previous accounting standard.  In addition, the ASU expands the disclosure requirements of lease arrangements.  Lessees
	and lessors will use a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of practical expedients.  The
	effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted.  Management continues to
	assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial statements.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
	(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”. 'The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
	of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
	adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
	amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
	606)”. Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
	adoption on its financial statements.




	 




	In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
	Payment Accounting”. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
	and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
	are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c)
	classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
	on its financial statements.

	Going
	Concern





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
	the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception and has a deficit
	accumulated of $36,745 as of December 31, 2015. The Company requires capital for its contemplated operational and marketing activities.
	The Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment
	of additional financing, the successful development of the Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its transition,
	ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully
	resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
	statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.




	 




	Note
	3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS




	 




	In
	February 2015, a Company stockholder advanced the Company $50,000 and the cash was received in May 2015. The advance is unsecured,
	bears no interest, contains no formal repayment terms and is convertible on demand into shares of restricted common stock. Management
	has not determined the conversion rate on this potentially dilutive security at December 31, 2015. The Loan is not yet convertible
	as the shares are not publically traded on an exchange




	 




	During
	the quarter ended September 30, 2015, Mr. Cornelius Ee, Vice President of the Company, advanced the Company $3,331 for general
	operating expenses. The advance is unsecured, non-interest bearing and has no specific terms of repayment. As of December 31,
	2015, the Company owed $3,331 to Mr. Cornelius Ee.




	 




	During
	2015, the Company entered into a six month service contract with ESA is to provide the Company with website design, development
	and integration with the Company’s CRM Program as well as web-based automated tracking system for the Company’s nationwide
	operations –customer relation management program.  The total contract value is approximately $414,000.  No services
	under this contract have been incurred at December 31, 2015.  The Company had a second contract with ESA to provide website
	design and development in the amount of $10,000.  This contract has been completed at December 31, 2015 and $10,000 is included
	in cost of revenues earned at December 31, 2015.  Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses – related party
	is $10,000 related to this second contract. 




	 




	Other
	related party transactions are disclosed in Notes 4 and 6 to these financial statements.




	 




	Note

	Common
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value common stock.




	 




	On
	June 23, 2014 (date of inception), the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Richard Chiang as share-based
	compensation. The fair value of the shares issued was determined to be $2,000. The compensation cost was fully recognized during
	2014.




	 




	On
	February 20, 2015, Richard Chiang, then the Company’s sole director and shareholder, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
	(the "SPA") whereby EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd.("ESA") purchased 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common
	stock from Mr. Chiang, which constituted 100% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock for $40,000. Upon Mr. Chiang's
	resignation following the execution of the SPA, ESA, as the Company’s sole shareholder elected Mr. Eugene Wong, as a Director
	of the Company.




	 




	Pursuant
	to its assignment assumption agreement, dated June 1, 2015, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted
	common stock to ESA. The agreement provides for revenue of $2,000 a month and will cease on January 1, 2018 subject to yearly
	renewal with the consent of both parties. The shares for the agreement were valued at $43,285. The shares were valued based on
	expected revenue over the initial term of the agreement of $62,000 less cost of revenue.




	 




	On
	May 1, 2015, the Company entered into a six-month consulting agreement with Tech Associates, Inc., an entity owned by the Company’s
	former stockholder, Richard Chiang. As part of the total consideration paid, the Company issued 250,000 shares of restricted common
	stock on October 1, 2015 to Tech Associates, Inc. (Note 7). The fair value of the shares issued was determined to be $5,000 based
	on the share price from the most recent share issuance on June 1, 2015 with ESA. The compensation cost was recognized over the
	initial service term of six months. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $5,000 of stock-based compensation was recognized.

	Preferred
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company’s board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock in one
	or more series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of
	the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference,
	and number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the
	effect of restricting dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing
	the liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. As of December 31, 2015, no shares
	of preferred stock were outstanding.

	Deferred
	income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 reflect the effect of temporary differences between amounts
	of assets, liabilities and equity for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets, liabilities and equity as measured
	by tax laws, as well as tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. The following table summarizes the components of temporary differences
	and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31:

	The
	Company has incurred losses since inception and has a deficit accumulated of $36,745 as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the
	Company recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as management does not expect to have the ability to utilize them
	within the carryforward period. Management will reassess the realization of the deferred tax assets based on the accounting standards
	for income taxes for each reporting period. To the extent the financial results of operations improve and it becomes more likely
	than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to reduce the valuation allowance.

	14.   INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.





	 




	Section 145
	of the 

	Delaware General Corporation Law (referred to as the "DGCL")

	 provides
	that a corporation may indemnify any person who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending
	or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or
	in the right of the corporation by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
	or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
	joint venture, trust or other enterprise), against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
	settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith
	and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any
	criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A similar standard is applicable in
	the case of derivative actions (i.e., actions by or in the right of the corporation), except that indemnification extends only
	to expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of such action and the statute requires
	court approval before there can be any indemnification where the person seeking indemnification has been found liable to the corporation.




	 




	Our
	amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions that limit the liability
	of our directors and officers for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Consequently, our directors will
	not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except liability
	(a) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders; (b) for any act or omission
	not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law; (c) under Section 174 of
	the DGCL regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases; or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived
	an improper personal benefit.




	 




	Any
	amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act,
	omission or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the DGCL is amended to provide for further limitations
	on the personal liability of directors or officers of corporations, then the personal liability of our directors and officers
	will be further limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.




	 




	In
	addition, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our current directors and officers containing provisions that
	are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the DGCL.




	 




	These
	indemnification agreements will require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors against certain liabilities that may
	arise by reason of their status or service as directors and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against
	them as to which they could be indemnified. We also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our future directors
	and officers. We intend to maintain liability insurance policies that indemnify our directors and officers against various liabilities,
	including certain liabilities under arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, that may be incurred by them in their
	capacity as such.




	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling
	us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against
	public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

	15.    RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.





	 




	On June
	23, 2014, the Company offered and sold 10,000,000 shares of common stock to Richard Chiang, its sole officer and director, in
	exchange for incorporation fees and annual resident agent fees in the State of Delaware, and developing our business concept and
	plan. The Company sold these shares of Common Stock under the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
	Act.




	 




	On
	February 20, 2015, the sole officer and director of the Company, Mr. Chiang, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”)
	pursuant to which he entered into an agreement to sell an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company’s
	common stock to EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd

	for a total of $40,000

	. These shares represented 100% of the Company’s
	issued and outstanding common stock. Effective upon the closing date of the SPA, Mr. Chiang resigned from his positions, and owned
	no shares of the Company’s stock and EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd was the majority stockholder of the Company. Effective on the
	same date and following the execution of the SPA, EliteSoft Asia Sdn Bhd elected Eugene Wong, as a director of the Company and
	transferred its shares to the officers and directors of the Company.




	 




	On
	June 1, 2015, the Company entered into an Assignment Assumption Agreement with Elite Soft Asia (the “Assignment Agreement”).
	Under the Assignment Agreement, we acquired the NZ Financial Limited Technology Services Agreement (the “NZ Agreement”)
	from Elite Soft Asia in consideration for 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock.




	 




	We relied
	upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended for the above issuances. We believed that Section 4(2) was available
	because:




	 






	 




	•




	None
	of these issuances involved underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	We
	placed restrictive legends on all certificates issued;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	No
	sales were made by general solicitation or advertising;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	Sales
	were made only to accredited investors





	 



	In connection with
	the above transactions, we provided the following to all investors:




	 






	 




	•




	Access
	to all our books and records.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	Access
	to all material contracts and documents relating to our operations.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	The
	opportunity to obtain any additional information, to the extent we possessed such information, necessary to verify the accuracy
	of the information to which the investors were given access.

	The Company’s Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the authorized but unissued common stock -without
	stockholder approval. The Company currently has no commitments to issue any shares of common stock, other than the shares associated
	with the conversion of the shareholder loan with EliteSoft Asia as disclosed above. However, the Company will, in all likelihood,
	issue a substantial number of additional shares in connection with a business combination. Since the Company expects to issue
	additional shares of common stock in connection with a business combination, existing stockholders of the Company may experience
	substantial dilution in their shares. However, it is impossible to predict whether a business combination will ultimately result
	in dilution to existing shareholders. If the target has a relatively weak balance sheet, a business combination may result in
	significant dilution. If a target has a relatively strong balance sheet, there may be little or no dilution.

	17.    UNDERTAKINGS.





	 




	 The
	undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:




	 






	1.




	To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:






	 




	 




	 






	 




	 i.




	To
	include any Prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	ii.




	To
	reflect in the Prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most
	recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information
	set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered
	(if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low
	or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of Prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant
	to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate
	offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	iii.





	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;




	 




	 














	-

	44

	-







	 













	 




	 




	 






	2.




	That,
	for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be
	deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
	at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.






	 




	 




	 






	3.




	To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold
	at the termination of the offering.






	 




	 




	 






	4.




	That,
	for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial
	distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned
	registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the
	purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned
	registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:






	 




	 




	 






	 




	 i.




	Any
	Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant
	to Rule 424;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	ii.




	Any
	free writing Prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred
	to by the undersigned registrant;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	iii.




	The
	portion of any other free writing Prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned
	registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and 






	 




	 




	 






	 




	iv.




	Any
	other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.






	 




	 




	 






	5.




	 




	That,
	for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser: Each Prospectus filed pursuant
	to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on
	Rule 430B or other than Prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration
	statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration
	statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated
	by reference into the registration statement or Prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser
	with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration
	statement or Prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such
	date of first use. 






	 




	Insofar
	as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling
	persons, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
	against such liabilities (other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person
	of the corporation in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling
	person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled
	by a controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by us is
	against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of
	such case.

	Statement on Form S-1






	 




	Dear Board of Directors:


	We have acted as
	counsel to EliteSoft Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the filing of the Company’s
	Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the “Commission”). The Company is seeking the registration of 12,000,000 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”)
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Shares are titled to “Selling Shareholders”
	defined under the Registration Statement. Following the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company intends to commence
	the offering of the Shares in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In the preparation
	of this opinion, we have relied solely on (i) various facts and factual assumptions as set forth in the Registration Statement;
	and (ii) certain representations made by the Company as to factual matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the
	“Management Certificate”). For purposes hereof, items (i) and (ii) are referred to collectively herein as the “Opinion
	Materials.” In addition to reviewing the Opinion Materials, in connection with rendering the opinions expressed below, we
	have examined originals (or copies identified to our satisfaction as true copies of the originals) of the following documents:
	(a) the Registration Statement, (b) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company dated June 23, 2014 authorizing 100,000,000 shares
	of common stock with a par value of $0.0001, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001, and as subsequently
	amended, (c) the Bylaws of the Company, and (d) such other documents deemed by us to be relevant to this opinion letter as may
	have been presented to us by the Company from time to time.


	We have assumed,
	with your consent, that the representations set forth in the Management Certificate are true, accurate, and complete as of the
	date hereof. While we are not aware of any facts inconsistent with the representations set forth in the Management Certificate,
	we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in any of the Opinion Materials (or other aspects
	of the Registration Statement unless set forth herein). In addition, we have examined no documents other than the Opinion Materials
	for purposes of this opinion and, therefore, our opinion is limited to matters determined through such an examination.

	In rendering the
	opinion set forth herein, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all
	signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents and the conformity to authentic original documents
	of all documents submitted to us as copies. Based solely on our review of the Opinion Materials, we are of the opinion that:




	 


	 


	(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, including statutory provisions, and all applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporations Law (the “DGCL”), and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws;




	 




	 


	 


	(b) The Company has taken all requisite corporate action and all other action recognized as being consistent with standards of proper corporate governance required with respect to the authorization, issuance and sale of common stock issued pursuant to the Registration Statement;




	 




	 


	 


	(c) The 12,000,000 shares of common stock being offered in the Registration Statement are duly authorized, unencumbered and not subject to any actual or threatened litigation, and not subject to any defaults or failures by the Company in filing annual reports with the State of Delaware;




	 




	 


	 


	(d) The rights, duties and obligations related to the 12,000,000 shares of common stock being offered in the Registration Statement are governed by the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, and where necessary, the DGCL;




	 




	 


	 


	(f) The questionnaire completed and signed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer is accurate.




	 


	Based upon and in reliance
	upon the foregoing, and after examination of such corporate and other records, certificates and other documents and such matters
	of law as we have deemed applicable or relevant to this opinion, it is our opinion that the Company has been duly incorporated
	and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
	and has full corporate power as described in the Registration Statement.


	 


	          The
	authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, as defined in the Articles of Incorporation,
	with a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which there are currently 12,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. The Company has not
	issued shares of preferred stock. The Company has taken proper corporate action to authorize such authorized capital stock and
	all the outstanding shares of such capital stock (including those shares being registered under the Registration Statement), when
	delivered in the manner and/or on the terms described in the Registration Statement (after it is declared effective), are duly
	and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The current shareholder of the Company has no preemptive rights with respect
	to the Common Stock.


	 


	This correspondence is
	necessary in conjunction with the submission of the Registration Statement, and thus the Board of Directors is hereby authorized
	to attach it as the Firm’s opinion related to certain representations in the Registration Statement, and to reference the
	Firm in the Registration Statement. This correspondence, however, does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
	as to unrelated or future matters.
