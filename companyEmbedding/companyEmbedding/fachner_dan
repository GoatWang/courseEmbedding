Parrot-Ice is a frozen beverage brand sold primarily in convenience stores.Dan Fachner, president of Ontario, Calif.-based ICEE, said, "We are pleased to add the Parrot-Ice brand to our portfolio of frozen beverages. Our goal is to grow the brand in existing retailers as well as new outlets and provide the sames sales, [image-nocss] service and marketing excellence we offer for ICEE, Slush Puppie and Arctic Blast."
ICEE, a leader in the frozen carbonated beverage industry, offers a comprehensive frozen beverage package and service network. It is a subsidiary of Pennsauken, N.J.-based J&J Snack Foods Corp. Its portfolio of products includes frozen soft pretzels under Superpretzel, Pretzel Fillers and other brand names; ICEE frozen beverages; Luigi's Real Italian Ice, Whole Fruit; frozen juice bars under the Minute Maid, Barq's, Shape Ups and Chill brand names; Tio Pepe's churros; The Funnel Cake Factory funnel cakes; and cookies under the Mrs. GoodCookie and Camden Creek brands.Gerry Shreiber, chairman, president and CEO of J&J Snack Foods, said during the company's second-quarter 2010 earnings call, "We expect revenues from Parrot Ice to be less than $2 million this fiscal year and we're rapidly integrating it into our ICEE masthead business."
