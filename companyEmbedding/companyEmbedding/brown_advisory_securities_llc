	We follow a philosophy that low-turnover, concentrated portfolios derived from sound bottom-up fundamental research provide an opportunity for attractive performance results over time. We have a culture and firm equity ownership structure that help us attract and retain professionals who share those beliefs, and we follow a repeatable investment process that helps us stay true to our philosophy.

	We construct balanced portfolios for private clients, nonprofits and institutions depending on the needs of the client. We can be 100% open architecture, using third-party managers only, or we can put together a mix of internal and external strategies, whatever is in the client's best interest.

Hedge Funds



	Hedge Funds

	The Investment Solutions Group is an investment-management team within Brown Advisory that specializes in asset allocation, manager selection, hedge funds and other alternative investment strategies. Dedicated to open-architecture solutions, our team has established a strong track record of identifying high-quality, third-party investment managers across the hedge fund, long-only and private equity universes. We leverage this expertise to help clients assemble portfolios that we believe best fit their needs and goals, offering clients a range of solutions from complete portfolio management to fulfillment of specific hedge-fund and alternative-asset mandates.

	Founded in June 2002, the Investment Solutions Group now manages in excess of $3.4 billion for clients (data as of January 31, 2017) in a combination of managed accounts, advisory relationships and fund-of-fund offerings.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Our Philosophy
Our Clients
Our Culture
Our History
Our People
 







In 1993, we founded Brown Advisory with a simple vision: to build an investment firm that is entirely focused on making a material and positive difference for our clients over time.
 
























					Thought•ful:



					1. Absorbed in or involving thought.





					/THôtfəl/



					2. Showing consideration for the needs of other people.





	 


(top-left to bottom-right)
	Michael D. Hankin; Daily Research Meeting; Logie Fitzwilliams and Keryn Brock; Ben Griswold; Dune Thorne; Porter Schutt and Bill Dugdale.

	Our mission remains the same today as when we opened our doors: to be a firm where every action we take, every investment strategy we employ, every decision we make, puts clients first. To award professionals an ownership stake in the company so that everyone sees their interests as aligned with our clients' long-term success. To be a firm that you would build for yourself, if given a blank slate. To be relevant to our clients five, 10 and 20 years from now. To be the firm to which all our clients turn and ask: What do you think I should do? In short, to be regarded by our clients as thoughtful investors.

	To fulfill that mission, we have carefully cultivated a culture of putting the needs and aspirations of clients before our own.


					Learn About Our Clients				

















					Brown Advisory's DNA				






	We firmly believe that our cultural DNA distinguishes us from other firms in our industry.


OUR CULTURE:
		Putting Clients First

		This principle pervades everything we do, not only because it is good for business, but also because we truly care about our clients. We feel privileged to work with them, as they do impressive work: raising successful families, building leading businesses, guiding important nonprofits, overseeing pensions that help people retire well and otherwise making a difference in the world. We take personal satisfaction in helping our clients succeed. That is Brown Advisory in a nutshell.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Brown Advisory - Private Clients








Overview
Performance
Advice
Service
 







To invest, advise and serve on your behalf, we at Brown Advisory begin with a simple but important step: We listen—to you.
We build our relationships on a foundation of careful listening, so we can understand each client's specific situation, and the role that they want us to play for them. Some clients are looking for a pure investment advisor, while others may seek more of a "family quarterback"; some clients look to us to manage their money ourselves, while others seek our assistance in selecting top-quality external managers. 

It all begins with listening. We ask you about your concerns, your needs and your hopes so that we can craft a customized plan to deliver the investment performance, strategic advice and client service that you deserve.













Performance



	We strive to help you navigate complex markets to achieve your investment goals. For most clients, we oversee balanced portfolios, while for others we invest in just a specific asset class or a single strategy.

Learn More





Advice



	We act as your advocate, helping you make good decisions on a wide range of challenges from planning issues to philanthropy to family businesses.

Learn More





Service



	We pledge to serve you with proactive attention, clear communication and complete confidentiality.

What are analysts saying about NetApp stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NetApp stock: 
1. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Very impressive April quarter results, including evidence that product GM is now on the upswing. July quarter guidance weak as we had previewed due to tough year ago y/y growth compare." (5/25/2017)
2. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "solid" and highlighted by a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.48 billion and an earnings per share of $0.86, which was four cents better than expected. Also, the company reported an operating margin of 20.7 percent, which was better than the 19.2 percent he had expected.Limited DownsideGarcha continued that while NetApp's revenue and EPS guidance fell short of expectations, there is reason to believe revenue can grow.  The analyst noted that in the recent quarter, product revenue grew 12 percent year-over-year, and while this growth rate will decelerate moving forward, the relative balance of strategic offering at two-thirds of total product revenues versus mature offering at one-third implies revenue growth could be "more achievable."Garcha further argued that although concerns over NetApp's growth profile remains, the analyst has confidence in the company's performance throughout the year, especially in improving operating margin performance.As such, the analyst's $37 price target reflects a P/E of 10x on his fiscal 2019 earnings per share estimate and factors in the approximate $5 of fully taxed net cash for per share. As such, downside in the stock is "limited" (5/25/2017)
3. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NetApp is a leading provider of innovative enterprise storage and data management solutions that simplify the complexity of storing, managing, protecting, and retaining enterprise data. The company has underperformed the broader market in the past one-year. Moreover, estimates have been stable ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release. We note that the company has mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. However, NetApp is gaining momentum in the flash-based solutions space, particularly with the newly introduced all-flash array. The company is also winning customers previously served by competitors like HP and EMC. We believe that the company's recent product launches and growing portfolio based on SolidFire acquisition will drive the top line growth going ahead. Meanwhile, cost reduction initiatives will facilitate margin expansion over the long run." (5/15/2017)
4. UBS AG analysts commented, "Product revenue of $784mn was up for the first time in 13 quarters and above consensus of $754mn. The product gross margin of 45.7% was down 540bps YoY, likely due to discounting, which is worrisome. The $0.08 EPS beat was more driven by a $0.05 benefit from lower R&D, than from revenue, which was at the mid-point of guidance. That said, management has cut significant costs, accelerated the transition to ClusterMode, and created a competitive all-flash line. Our last three VAR Surveys reflected demand improvement. Still, we question whether the good times last with discounting hurting gross margin and R&D under pressure." (2/16/2017)
5. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "The turn-around at NTAP continued in the January quarter, with revenues and operating expenses better, offset by lower product gross margins. We are impressed with the execution the last few quarters, but stay on the sidelines." (2/16/2017)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 18 Hold Ratings, 10 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.23)Consensus Price Target: $41.88 (5.60% downside)

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.
