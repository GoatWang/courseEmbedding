ROCKIES REGION 2007 LP - 10-K - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis, as well as other sections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be read in conjunction with this Partnership's accompanying financial statements and related notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Further, this Partnership encourages the reader to revisit the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this report.
Partnership Operating Results Overview
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales decreased 53% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily attributable to the decrease in the average sales price per Boe of 53% year over year. The average selling price per Boe was $23.28 for the current year compared to $49.23 for 2014.
As a result of the decreased sales revenues, this Partnership experienced a significant decrease in cash flows from operations. In 2015, this Partnership had net cash from operations of $469,000, as compared to net cash from operations of $2,763,000 in 2014. Accordingly, cash distributions decreased 78% to $534,000 in 2015 compared to $2,452,000 in 2014.
This Partnership recognized an impairment charge of approximately $4.6 million and $15.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, to write-down certain capitalized well costs on its proved crude oil and natural gas properties. Further deterioration of commodity prices could result in additional impairment charges to this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas properties. See Note 9, Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties, to this Partnership's financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
The Managing General Partner has not entered into derivative arrangements on behalf of this Partnership in the last few years and does not currently anticipate entering into additional commodity based derivative instruments on behalf of this Partnership; however, this could change in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales
Changes in Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales Volumes. For 2015 compared to 2014, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production, on an energy equivalency-basis, remained relatively consistent, as decreases in production during the first half of 2015 due to high line pressure hindering production from flowing into the gathering system was largely offset by increases in production in the second half of 2015, mainly attributable to a reduction in system line pressures, the installation of new compressor stations and resumed production from certain wells that were shut-in in prior periods for well-bore integrity testing.
This Partnership continued to experience high line pressures on the midstream system in the first half of 2015. However, the Lucerne II processing plant and additional new compressor stations on the gathering system began initial operations in June 2015, resulting in immediate reductions in line pressures. This Partnership experienced further line pressure reductions in the fourth quarter of 2015, particularly in December, when this Partnership's primary service provider, DCP, completed its Grand Parkway gas gathering project. Line pressures on the midstream system decreased from approximately 170 psi at June 30, 2015 to approximately 120 psi at December 31, 2015. As a result of the reduction in line pressures during the second half of 2015, production from this Partnership's vertical wells increased by 17% in the second half of 2015 when compared to the first half. Further, the Managing General Partner expects sustained relief of gathering system pressure on this Partnership's primary gatherer's system through 2016, depending upon the impact of reduced drilling activity in the field going forward. If there is sustained relief of the gathering system pressure as anticipated, several currently shut-in wells may come on-line, resulting in improved production. This Partnership relies on its third-party midstream service provider to construct compression, gathering and processing facilities to keep pace with production growth. As a result, the timing and availability of additional facilities going forward is beyond the Managing General Partner's control. Falling commodity prices have resulted in reduced investment in midstream facilities by some third parties, increasing the risk that sufficient midstream infrastructure may not be available in future periods for sustained relief of gathering system line pressures.
Changes in Crude Oil Sales. The approximate $1,463,000, or 54%, decrease in crude oil sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was attributable to a decrease in the average selling price of 52% per Bbl and a production volume decrease of 5%. The average selling price per Bbl was $39.18 for 2015 compared to $81.47 for 2014.
Changes in Natural Gas Sales. The approximate $249,000, or 47%, decrease in natural gas sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was due to a decrease in the average selling price per Mcf of 50%, offset in part by a production volume increase of 5%. The average selling price per Mcf was $2.00 for 2015 compared to $3.98 for 2014.
Changes in NGLs Sales. The approximate $159,000, or 50%, decrease in NGLs sales for 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly due to a decrease in the average selling price of 51% per Bbl. The average selling price per Bbl was $9.19 for 2015 compared to $18.82 for 2014.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Pricing. This Partnership's results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the Managing General Partner's ability to market this Partnership's production effectively. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. The price of crude oil decreased during the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2015 amid continuing concerns regarding high
U.S.
inventories and slowing global demand for crude oil. Natural gas prices in 2015 were at significantly lower levels than the comparable periods of 2014. NGL prices declined significantly during 2015 and, while they have stabilized somewhat, also remain at low levels relative to those experienced in 2014. The Managing General Partner expects pricing to remain at depressed levels in 2016 and perhaps beyond. These declines in prices have had a material impact on this Partnership's 2015 financial results.
This Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are recorded under either the "net-back" or "gross" method of accounting, depending upon the related purchase agreement. This Partnership uses the "net-back" method of accounting for natural gas and NGLs, as well as a portion of this Partnership's crude oil production as the majority of the purchasers of these commodities also provide transportation, gathering and processing services. This Partnership sells commodities at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price as transportation and processing costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price. The net-back method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based. This Partnership uses the "gross" method of accounting for crude oil delivered through the White Cliffs pipeline as the purchasers do not provide transportation, gathering or processing services. Under this method, this Partnership recognizes revenues based on the gross selling price and recognizes transportation, gathering and processing expenses as a component of production costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Production Costs
Generally, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs vary with changes in total crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales and production volumes. Production taxes are estimates by the Managing General Partner based on tax rates determined using published information. These estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the Managing General Partner with the taxing authorities. Production taxes vary directly with crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales. Fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as production decreases. In addition, general oil field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on services required, but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment repairs and maintenance, snow removal, environmental compliance and remediation and service rig workovers.
Changes in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production expenses. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $159,000 compared to 2014, primarily attributable to an increase in environmental and regulatory compliance expenses, costs for additional contract labor, oil transportation cost on the White Cliffs pipeline, well service rig costs and production equipment costs. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in production taxes consistent with sales declines from 2014. Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production costs per Boe increased to $15.76 during 2015 from $13.51 in 2014 due to higher production costs.
Direct costs - general and administrative
Direct costs - general and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased approximately $7,000 compared to 2014, primarily attributable to lower professional fees for audit services.

DD&A expense decreased approximately $1,425,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 mainly attributable to a 62% decrease in the DD&A expense rate in 2015. The DD&A expense rate per Boe decreased to $12.03 for 2015 compared to $31.80 during 2014, primarily due to the effect of the impairments recorded on proved crude oil and natural gas properties in December 2014 and September 2015.
Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
In 2015, this Partnership recognized impairment charges of approximately $4.6 million to write-down certain capitalized well costs on its proved crude oil and natural gas properties, of which $1.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of approximately $1.4 million, excluding estimated salvage value of $0.5 million, was determined based on estimated future discounted net cash flows, a Level 3 input, using estimated production and future crude oil and natural gas prices which the Managing General Partner reasonably expects this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas will be sold and decreased reserve quantities. Further deterioration of commodity prices could result in additional impairment charges to this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas properties. See Note 9, Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties, to this Partnership's financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
In 2014, this Partnership recognized an impairment charge of approximately $15.8 million to write-down certain capitalized well costs on its proved crude oil and natural gas properties. The impairment charge represented the amount by which the carrying value of the crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of approximately $5.5 million, excluding estimated salvage value of $1.3 million, was determined based on estimated future discounted net cash flows, a Level 3 input, using estimated production and future crude oil and natural gas prices which the Managing General Partner reasonably expects this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas will be sold and decreased reserve quantities. See Note 9, Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties, to this Partnership's financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details of this Partnership's proved property impairment.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Accretion Expense
Of the 75 wells in this partnership, 38 wells had a decrease in production totaling approximately 13.8 MBoe, or 19%, in 2015 compared to 2014 and 34 wells had an increase in production totaling approximately 13.7 MBoe, or 19%, in 2015 compared to 2014. Three wells did not produce or produced minimal amounts of hydrocarbons in 2015 and 2014. The Managing General Partner is reviewing the Partnership's wells that have the potential to increase production during this lower line pressure environment by incurring minimal expense. The Managing General Partner expects that a portion of this Partnership's wells may be uneconomical to operate and may be plugged and abandoned. As a result, as of December 31, 2015, this Partnership has classified a portion of the asset retirement obligation as a current liability.
Changes in accretion of asset retirement obligations ("ARO") expense. ARO expense increased $55,000, or 74%, to $129,000 in 2015 compared to $74,000 in 2014, primarily attributable to an increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in December 2014 to reflect increased estimated costs for materials and services related to the plugging and abandonment of certain wells, as well as a decrease in the estimated useful life of these wells.
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, this Partnership's primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operating activities. Fluctuations in this Partnership's operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and sales volumes. This source of cash has primarily been used to fund this Partnership's operating costs, direct costs-general and administrative, capital program and distributions to the Investor Partners and the Managing General Partner.
This Partnership's future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and revenues generated from crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production activities. However, crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production from existing properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the remaining life of the wells. Therefore, this Partnership anticipates a lower annual level of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production and, therefore, lower revenues, unless commodity prices increase. Under these circumstances, decreased production would have a material adverse impact on this Partnership's operations and may result in the continued lack of cash distributions to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners through 2016 and beyond.
Working Capital
At December 31, 2015, this Partnership had working capital of $182,000, compared to working capital of $637,000 at December 31, 2014. The decrease of $455,000 was primarily due to the following changes:
• a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $133,000;
• a decrease in accounts receivable of $46,000;
• an increase in current asset retirement obligations of $230,000; and
• an increase in amounts due to Managing General Partner-other, net, of $58,000.
Offset in part by;
• a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8,000; and
• an increase in crude oil inventory of $4,000.
The $133,000 decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to cash utilized to fund operating activities, capital expenditures and cash distributions to partners.
Although the D&O Agreement permits this Partnership to borrow funds on its behalf for Partnership activities, the Managing General Partner does not anticipate electing to fund any portion of this Partnership's operations through borrowings. Partnership borrowings, should any occur, will be non-recourse to the Investor Partners. Accordingly, this Partnership, rather than the Investor Partners, will be responsible for repaying any amounts borrowed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Flows
Operating Activities
This Partnership's cash flows from operating activities in 2015 were primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, operating costs and direct costs-general and administrative expenses. The key components for the changes in this Partnership's cash flows from operating activities are described in more detail in Results of Operations above.
Net cash flows from operating activities were approximately $469,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to approximately $2,763,000 in 2014. The decrease of approximately $2,294,000 in cash from operating activities was due primarily to the following:
• a decrease in crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales of $1,871,000;
• a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities of $270,000; and
• an increase in production costs of $159,000.
Offset in part by:
• a decrease in direct costs-general and administrative of $7,000.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of investments in equipment. From time to time, this Partnership invests in equipment which supports treatment, delivery and measurement of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs or environmental protection. During the year ended December 31, 2015, investments in equipment were approximately $68,000 compared to $252,000 in 2014.
Financing Activities
This Partnership initiated monthly cash distributions to investors in May 2008 and has distributed $113.4 million through December 31, 2015. The table below presents cash distributions to this Partnership's investors. Distributions to the Managing General Partner represent amounts distributed to the Managing General Partner for its 37% general partner interest in this Partnership. Distributions to Investor Partners represent amounts distributed to Investor Partners for their 63% ownership share in this Partnership and include amounts distributed to the Managing General Partner for limited partnership units repurchased.

                                   Cash Distributions

Year ended December 31,    Managing General Partner     Investor Partners        Total
         2015             $                 197,693    $           336,611    $  534,304
         2014                               907,335              1,544,922     2,452,257



The decrease in distributions for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from operations during 2015 resulting from the decrease in the average sales price per Boe.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2015, this Partnership had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on this Partnership's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Commitments and Contingencies
See Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, to the accompanying financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



                                       22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent Accounting Standards
See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Managing General Partner has identified the following policies as critical to business operations and the understanding of the results of operations of this Partnership. The following is not a comprehensive list of all of this Partnership's accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America
, with no need for management's judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. However, certain of this Partnership's accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of this Partnership's financial position and results of operations and the Managing General Partner may use significant judgment in their application. As a result, these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, the Managing General Partner uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on historical experience, observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Properties
This Partnership accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting. Costs of proved developed producing properties and development dry hole costs are capitalized and depreciated or depleted by the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved developed producing reserves. Property acquisition costs are depreciated or depleted on the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved reserves.
Annually, the Managing General Partner engages independent petroleum engineers to prepare reserve and economic evaluations of this Partnership's properties on a well-by-well basis as of December 31. Proved developed reserves are those crude oil, natural gas and NGLs quantities expected to be recovered from currently producing zones under the continuation of present operating methods. This Partnership's reserves are adjusted for divestitures during the year as needed. The process of estimating and evaluating crude oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, revisions in existing reserve estimates occur. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the Managing General Partner's most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates over time. Because estimates of reserves significantly affect this Partnership's DD&A expense, a change in this Partnership's estimated reserves could have an effect on its net income.
This Partnership assesses its crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment upon a triggering event by comparing net capitalized costs to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows on a field-by-field basis using estimated production based upon prices at which the Managing General Partner reasonably estimates the commodities to be sold. Any impairment in value is charged to impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties. The estimates of future prices may differ from current market prices of crude oil and natural gas. Any downward revisions in estimates to this Partnership's reserve quantities, expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a triggering event and, therefore, a reduction in undiscounted future net cash flows and an impairment of this Partnership's crude oil and natural gas properties. Although this Partnership's cash flow estimates are based on the relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas and NGLs Sales Revenue Recognition
Crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a determinable price, delivery has occurred, rights and responsibility of ownership have transferred and collection of revenue is reasonably assured. This Partnership records sales revenue based on an estimate of the volumes delivered at estimated prices (if known, actual volumes and prices received are utilized) as determined by the applicable sales agreement. If actual volumes and prices are not known, the Managing General Partner estimates this Partnership's sales volumes based on the Managing General Partner's measured volume


                                       23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
readings. The Managing General Partner then adjusts this Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales in subsequent periods based on the data received from this Partnership's purchasers that reflects actual volumes and prices received. This Partnership receives payment for sales from one to three months after actual delivery has occurred. The differences in sales estimates and actual sales are recorded up to two months later. Historically, differences have been immaterial.
This Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales are concentrated with a few major customers. This concentrates the significance of credit risk exposure. To date, this Partnership has had no material counterparty default losses. See Note 4, Concentration of Risk, to the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Asset retirement obligations are accounted for by recording the fair value of well plugging and abandonment obligations when incurred, which is at the time the well is spud. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is increased by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in present value. The initial capitalized costs, net of salvage value, are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets through charges to DD&A expense. If the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes, an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in retirement costs or the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations. Recent Accounting Standards
