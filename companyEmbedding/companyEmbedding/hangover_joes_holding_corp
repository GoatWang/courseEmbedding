(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and the Company's future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which the Company operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the Company's management. Words such as "hopes," "expects," "anticipates," "targets," "goals," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "may," variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of the Company's future financial performance, including projections under our licensing and distribution arrangements, the Company's anticipated growth potential in its business, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified under "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.  The Company is under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this report. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  Background  Hangover Joe's Holding Corporation ("HJHC" or the "Company") was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado in December 2005 as Across American Real Estate Exchange, Inc. ("AAEX"). In February 2010, Accredited Members, Inc. ("AMI"), a provider of investor research and management services, was merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAEX, and AMI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In May 2010, AAEX changed its name to Accredited Members Holding Corporation.  On July 25, 2012, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") with Hangover Joe's, Inc., a privately-held Colorado corporation ("HOJ"), whereby on July 25, 2012, the Company acquired HOJ in a reverse triangular merger (the "Acquisition"). Upon closing the Acquisition, the Company issued 83,514,827 common shares to the HOJ shareholders in exchange for all of their ownership interests in HOJ such that the former owners of HOJ owned approximately 69% of the Company post Acquisition. The shareholders of the Company prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 31% of the Company post Acquisition. As a result of the Acquisition on July 25, 2012, the Company changed its name to Hangover Joe's Holding Corporation.  The Merger Agreement further provided that, within five business days after the closing of the Acquisition the Company would sell to Accredited Members Acquisition Corporation ("Buyer") all of the equity interests in three of the Company's subsidiaries (the "Sale"), being Accredited Members, Inc., AMHC Managed Services, Inc. and World Wide Premium Packers, Inc. (collectively, the "Subsidiaries"). Buyer is a privately-held Colorado corporation owned by two former directors of the Company, JW Roth and David Lavigne. The parties closed the Sale on July 27, 2012. Buyer paid $10,000 and assumed all liabilities of the Subsidiaries in exchange for all of the shares in the Subsidiaries owned by the Company.  HOJ is a Colorado corporation formed on March 5, 2012. HOJ was formed for the purpose of acquiring all of the assets of both Hangover Joe's Products LLC ("HOJ LLC") and Hangover Joe's Joint Venture ("HOJ JV"). HOJ LLC had conducted operations through HOJ JV, with the owner of HOJ LLC being one of the same owners and control persons of HOJ JV. Effective March 30, 2012, HOJ acquired the net assets of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV through the issuance of common stock of HOJ. Because HOJ had no significant assets or business operations prior to the merger and each of these entities were owned by the same control group, this transaction was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control. Accordingly, the historical results of operations of HOJ LLC and HOJ JV are included in the results of operations of the Company.  Because all of the operating businesses of AMHC were contemporaneously sold within five business days after the Acquisition, the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of HOJ. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of HOJ and its predecessor entities, HOJ LLC and HOJ JV, prior to the date of Acquisition. The historical results of operations and cash flows of AMHC and the Subsidiaries prior to the date of the Acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The historical stockholders' equity of HOJ prior to the exchange was retroactively restated (a recapitalization) for the equivalent number of shares received in the exchange after giving effect to any differences in the par value of the AMHC and HOJ common stock, with an offset to additional paid-in capital. The restated consolidated accumulated deficit of the accounting acquirer (HOJ) has been carried forward after the exchange.  The term the "Company" as used herein is intended to refer to the Hangover Joes Holding Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hangover Joes Inc. The Company has a limited operating history and there will be limited continuing impact regarding these operations, and the Company cannot provide any assurance it will be able to raise funds through a future issuance of equity or debt to carry out its business plan.  Plan of Operation  The Company sells an all-natural, two-ounce beverage, formulated to help relieve the symptoms associated with alcohol induced hangovers - the Hangover Recovery Shot. The Hangover Recovery Shot is also an officially licensed product of The Hangover movie series from Warner Brothers. The Company has registered the trademark "Hangover Joe's Get Up & Go" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. The assets consist of intellectual property relating to Hangover Joe's Recovery Shot, including but not limited to a license agreement dated July 19, 2011, between the LLC and Warner Bros. Consumer Products, Inc. The license agreement permits HOJ to use the costumes, artwork logos, and other elements depicted in the 2009 movie "The Hangover" during the term of the license agreement, as amended, which expired January 31, 2016.  The Company sells its products primarily to convenience stores, liquor stores and grocery stores through distribution agreements, as well as through online internet sales. The Company began selling its products in February 2011. HOJ is actively seeking to expand the distribution of its product, the Hangover Joe's Recovery Shot, and has recently entered into distribution agreements to expand its reach to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  Management Changes  Effective March 1, 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Eric Skae to serve as interim Chief Operating Officer ("COO"). Mr. Skae was to be paid an annual salary of $100,000 in the same manner as other officers of the Company. Mr. Skae resigned on August 6, 2013. The Company also appointed Jeff Jonke as its Executive Vice President and General Manager on August 19, 2013. Mr. Jonke resigned effective October 31, 2013. Effective December 1, 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Shawn Adamson to serve as Chief Sales and Marketing Officer. Mr. Adamson will be paid an annual salary of $100,000, a royalty of one cent per bottle, a 12.5% bonus of the proceeds of sale in the event the Company is sold plus benefits and stock. Also, Effective December 1, 2013, the Board of Directors appointed Matthew Veal to serve as Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and Interim Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and added Mr. Veal to the board of directors. Mr. Veal will be paid an annual salary of $180,000, a royalty of one cent per bottle, a 5% bonus of the proceeds of sale in the event the Company is sold plus benefits and stock. Also, Effective December 1, 2013, the Board of Directors reappointed Michael Jaynes to serve as Chairman of the Board. Mr. Jaynes will be paid an annual salary of $100,000, a royalty of one cent per bottle, a 12.5% bonus of the proceeds of sale in the event the Company is sold plus benefits and stock.  Results of Operations  Through the second Quarter of 2013, the Company's operations have generally grown as the Company has expanded its marketing efforts. Although the Company's increased operations have resulted in greater net sales for the Company, the Company's costs of goods sold and operating costs have also increased.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012  For the three months ended September 30, 2013, we experienced a consolidated net loss of $400,000 compared to a consolidated net loss of $394,000 during the comparable period last year. Net Sales and gross profits decreased $382,000 and $142,000 or 99% and 99%, respectively from the comparable period last year. These decreases were offset by a $112,000 decrease in sales & marketing costs and a $75,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses from the comparable period last year.  Net Sales  During the three months ended September 30, 2013, the Company generated approximately $4,000 in net sales compared to $387,000 in net sales in the comparable period last year. The $382,000 or 99% decrease in net sales from the comparable period last year was primarily due to the lack of resources not only for sales and marketing but production and shipping and due to the deferral of revenue on certain sales (approximately $14,000) to distributors in which the Company determined that collectibility was not assured. The Company has reviewed its sales channels, and a concern exists due to the lack of resources we can devote to the necessary sales and marketing and brand building to ensure product success.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold, which includes product costs and product royalties, decreased in the aggregate from $241,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $3,000 for the same period this year. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales changed from 63% of sales for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 to 79% for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. This change was primarily due to increased costs related to instability - including change in contract bottler, change in materials, old inventory being cleared in prior year, initial fixed guaranteed royalty costs to Warner Brothers from our new marketing campaign (see net sales above) and financial challenges relating ability to negotiate lower costs.  Gross Profit  During the three months ended September 30, 2013, the Company realized a gross profit of $1,000 or 21% of net sales compared to a gross profit of $142,000 or 37% of net sales during the same period last year. Although average sales prices in 2013 were higher compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2012, lower product sales quantities, and higher product costs (described in cost of sales above) resulted in the overall decrease in gross profit in both dollar and percentage terms during the three months ended September 30, 2013.  Sales & Marketing Costs  Sales & marketing costs decreased $112,000 or 43% to $146,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $258,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in resources available for sales salaries and consulting expense, trade shows, and graphic design costs in this area.  General & Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses decreased $76,000 or 27% to $202,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $278,000 for the same period last year. The increase was due to several factors amortization of costs from our contract with the Bricktown Group, and higher investor relations costs during 2013 also contributed to the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012  For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we experienced a consolidated net loss of $1,692,000 compared to a consolidated net loss of $943,000 during the comparable period last year. Net Sales and gross profits each decreased $414,000 and $186,000 or 56% and 73%, respectively from the comparable period last year. These decreases were slightly offset by a $34,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses from the comparable period last year.  Net Sales  During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the Company generated approximately $322,000 in net sales compared to $736,000 in net sales in the comparable period last year. The $414,000 or 56% decrease in net sales from the comparable period last year was primarily due to lower sales volume from new distribution partners in the United States related to the May 20 marketing campaign began from the movie Hangover III. The Company has reviewed its sales channels, and while we did incur drops in comparison to the second half of the prior year, we believe new channels can be opened to supplement what we have and replace some of the business we no longer have, but we believe additional marketing resources will be needed to build our customer base to its full potential.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods sold, which includes product costs, packaging materials, and product royalties, decreased in the aggregate from $480,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to $252,000 for the same period this year. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased from 65% of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 to 78% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to higher costs, particularly royalty guaranteed amounts.  Gross Profit  During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the Company realized a gross profit of $70,000 or 22% of net sales compared to $256,000 or 35% of net sales during the same period last year. Although average sales prices in 2013 were substantially the same when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012, lower product sales quantities and higher product costs (described in cost of sales above) resulted in the overall decrease in gross profit in both dollar and percentage terms during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.  Sales & Marketing Costs  Sales & marketing costs decreased $34,000 or 6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 when the total was $573,000 as compared to $607,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to increases in advertising and sales consulting expenses.  General & Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses increased $306,000 or 52% to $898,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to $592,000 for the same period last year. The increase was due to several factors including higher accounting and ancillary costs associated with becoming a public entity such as $30,000 spent on public relations/awareness, amortization of approximately $278,000 of costs from our contract with the Bricktown Group, higher legal costs associated with negotiating financing transactions and licensing, higher salaries, and higher investor relations costs during 2013 also contributed to the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  Material Changes in Financial Condition; Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's consolidated financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2013, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph which means that the auditors stated that conditions exist that raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Cash Flows  During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we used proceeds from the borrowing of approximately $492,000 under our new credit facilities to fund our operations whereas during the comparable period in 2012, we used cash accumulated from prior periods to fund our operations. As described above, the company significantly increased its sales and marketing costs during 2012 to expand its distribution network in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Cash as of September 30, 2013 was $10,000 as compared to $9,000 at December 31, 2012.  Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $576,000 as compared to $670,000 for the comparable period last year. This decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to higher operating expenses during 2013 as compared to the same period last year, and was offset by increases in accounts payable.  Cash flow provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $577,000 compared to $9,000 for the comparable period last year. This was due to the above referenced net borrowings under the credit facility in 2013 discussed above offset by amounts paid off on other inventory credit arrangement and cash raised from the sale of equity.  Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2013, we had cash of $10,000 and a working capital deficit of $2,151,000 as compared to cash of $9,000 and working capital deficit of $1,407,000 as of December 31, 2012. The improvement in our cash was due to our new credit facilities, however, due to our losses, our working capital deficit increased.  Although the Company has generated revenue through the sale of its products, the Company's cash flow has not been sufficient to cover its operating expenses and the Company has had to rely upon proceeds from borrowings under its credit facilities and from the sale of common stock through private placements to fund its operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, the Company received gross proceeds of $425,000 under its credit facility. We anticipate that we will need to rely on sales of our securities in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned business activities. If we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing, including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, our business, financial condition and operating activities will be adversely impacted.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our shareholders.  Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements  In the third quarter of 2013, there was no new adopted or proposed accounting guidance that could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.  Critical Accounting Policies  There have been no changes to the Company's critical accounting policies in the three months ended September 30, 2013, from those contained in the Company's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Hangover Joe’s Formula



Hangover Joe's Get Up & Go & The Power Of Kudzu!
Why does Kudzu work for hangovers?
When it comes to how something works, modern scientific bio-medicine is 
very keen to understand medicinal mechanisms.
Herbs have a sort of thermal quality about them. For instance mint is 
cool and peppers are hot.
Herbs also have tastes such as spicy (also called pungent or acrid) 
sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and bland. Each of these tastes has 
medicinal functions associated with it. For instance, sweet and sour 
together are one way to stimulate the production of body fluids. If you 
think about how sweet and sour taste in your mouth you might get an 
intuitive sense of how the body responds to these tastes used together. 
As they make your mouth water, so do they hydrate your body.
Finally, herbs have target organs and channels (these are the 
acupuncture meridians associated with the organs). A herb that is 
described as entering the liver or the kidneys has an effect on those 
organs as well as the channels associated with those organs. Affecting 
the channel often means that the part of the body that will benefit from 
the medicinal properties of the herb will lie on the trajectory of that 
channel. For instance, an herb for what is stomach fire? might address heartburn 
in the stomach, but also bleeding gums which is an area through which 
the stomach channel passes.
How Does Kudzu Work on Alcohol?
First let's describe the energetic properties of alcohol, then we'll see 
how Kudzu addresses these qualities.
Just as herbs are given tastes and temperatures, so are other things that 
might end up going into our mouths. Alcohol is considered to be as being warm or 
hot in temperature. It makes you feel warm, it burns the stomach, and it 
turns your face red. These are all indications that alcohol's thermal 
nature is hot. Its effect on the human body is the creation of dampness and 
heat inside the body. The heat part is relatively easy to understand as 
I just mentioned. However the dampness is something that we'll see more 
in the hangover than the heat of intoxication.

Alcohol makes you all warm and humid inside.
Don't get all confused by the fact that bio-medicine explains that the 
reason for the red face is capillary dilation. This is not a situation 
where it has to be one cause or the other.
Kudzu root has the following properties: It is spicy, sweet, cool, and 
enters the spleen and stomach.
The spicy flavor in it is said to have a dispersing quality. If 
something is spicy enough it'll make you sweat. Both peppers and mint 
(really strong medicinal mint, not necessarily mint flavored candy) are 
considered spicy as they both give rise to a light sweat. Spicy doesn't 
always cause a sweat, but it does have an outward directionality that 
can disperse and push out toxins left behind by alcohol. Using Kudzu 
root will provide a very gentle dispersing quality, using the flower of 
the Kudzu plant will provide a stronger dispersion of that alcohol 
toxicity in the body this is what we do with Hangover Joe's Get Up & Go 
we use the flower of the root.
Kudzu cools and nourishes while eliminating the residual effects of alcohol.
Kudzu's cool properties address the heat component of the alcohol. In 
short, it will cool you off. Even after the intoxication period, there 
is latent heat brewing deep down inside. This is especially evident 
among alcoholics whose daily exposure to alcohol causes this heat to 
become more and more profound resulting in a ruddy almost red complexion 
as a permanent state.
Kudzu also enters the spleen and stomach and it is this ability to enter 
into the these organs that gives Kudzu the ability to address a 
hangover. The Stomach (and stomach) is obviously very upset during the 
hangover, but the dizziness associated with the hangover is also at 
least partly a function of the spleen. One of the spleen's many duties 
is the lifting of "clear yang". Clear yang as it is said in traditional 
Chinese medicine(TCM) it is the energy that fills our heads with 
brightness and intelligence. When clear yang is not rising into the 
head, symptoms such as dizziness, fogginess, lack of mental clarity, and 
fatigue arise. Alcohol clearly has an effect on the body to generate 
these sensations.
In particular, it is the damp quality of the alcohol that causes these 
problems. To a certain extent, the dampness also causes the nausea, 
though this is a slightly different issue. When clear yang can't rise, 
explain turbid yin can't descend. When turbidity can't go downward, it wants to 
come upward, hence the nausea and vomiting of the hangover or acute 
state of alcohol intoxication.

Alcohol intoxication is false clear yang rising.
One thing that alcohol does provide is a sort of false clear yang 
rising. This results in the buoyancy and temporary joy of drunkenness. 
It temporarily stimulates the upward rising function for the clear yang 
of the Spleen, while also stimulating the upward movement of the liver, 
another organ that according to TCM is involved with circulation of 
energies in the body.
The heat associated with the damp-heat of alcohol also damages the body 
fluids, not unlike you might get dehydrated when running a fever. Kudzu's 
function of generating fluids actually assists with this problem of 
dehydration. Bio-medically speaking, alcohol has the effect of 
inhibiting the anti-diuretic hormone secreted in your brain. This leads 
to an increase in your urinary output or as is commonly said "you don't 
buy beer, you rent it." If you urinate too much, your blood chemistry 
can be affected leading to the symptoms such as thirst, weakness, 
dryness of mucous membranes, dizziness, and light headedness.
Kudzu helps the clear yang rise, and the turbid yin descend.
The sweet flavor of Kudzu, although it may not be evident to the taste 
buds, is most certainly evident in how the body responds to this herb. 
Sweet nourishes or strengthens and it has a natural affinity for the 
digestive organs that TCM calls the Spleen and Stomach. So adding a 
gentle sweet flavor, (as opposed to the unnatural sweetness of something 
like a soda), can add some strength to the digestive organs, thus 
regulating their functions that were compromised by excessive alcohol 
intake. Biomedicine says that alcohol damages the linings of the stomach 
and intestines. This will give rise to abdominal pain, nausea, and 
vomiting. TCM says that the damp-heat of alcohol damages the stomach and 
liver which results in many of the same problems as described by the 
biomedical explanation. Dampness is something that commonly collects in 
the stomach giving rise to nausea and vomiting.
All in all, Kudzu is a benign herb with no observed toxicity, its 
actually a food commonly served in some Asian cuisines. It works 
perfect in our Formulated Hangover Joe's Get Up & Go in helping aid in 
the relief of a hangover. Hangover Joe's is the nation's leading Hangover 
Recovery Shot.
ANOTHER KEY INGREDIENT:
Picamilon (also known as nicotinoyl-GABA, pycamilon, and pikamilon) is a 
dietary supplement formed by combining niacin with GABA. It was 
developed in the Soviet Union in 1969 by the All-Union Vitamins 
Scientific Research. Picamilon is able to cross the blood-brain barrier 
and then is hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin. The released GABA in theory 
would activate GABA receptors, potentially producing an anxiolytic 
response. The second released component, niacin, acts as a strong 
vasodilator, which might be useful for the treatment of headaches. This 
helps relieve the symptoms associated with the morning after headache 
from a hangover.
Shot Directions
Drink bottle for maximum recovery when you wake up. Do not exceed two 
bottles daily.

I work late and it gives me that little boost I need to give my best without the letdown I get a few hours later from other energy shots." -Deborah, registered nurse, Nashville, TN.

Hangover Joe’s Holding Corp (OTCMKTS:HJOE) is a fascinating story exploding out of sub penny land that has been highly successful in attracting legions of shareholders and transforming into one of the top most traded stocks on the entire bb’s.
On June 1 HJOE announced that the Git-R-Done-Energy Drink will be featured on FYI owned by A&E Networks, a joint venture between the DisneyABC Television Group subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and the Hearst Corporation.
The episode featuring Git-R-Done Energy Shot will air on June 6th on FYI at 9pm EST. Larry the Cable Guy is featured in the show and explains just how to Git R Done! The show was to originally air on June 4th but now is changed to Saturday night June 6th in prime time to attract even more viewers.
The show features the industrial production lines of major food companies. “We filmed the show in late February,” said CEO of Hangover Joe’s Matthew Veal. “These are exciting times for our new brand Git-R-Done-Energy. We are emerging as the leader in healthy energy shots and will be featuring the brand on Food Factory and how the product works and the behind the scene manufacturing process and the state of the manufacturing procedures of United 1 Labs our co-packer in Dallas, Texas.”
HJOE was trading for as little as $0.0002 earlier this month before the stock went parabolic making steady gains in recent days topping $0.005. Speculators are looking for a break into penny land here.
Hangover Joe’s Holding Corp (OTCMKTS:HJOE) is the maker of “The Hangover” Recovery Shot and developers of an innovative state of the art proprietary Git-R-Done-Energy Shot, along with Git-R-Done Productions, Inc.
According to the Company Hangover Joe’s is a patent pending, revolutionary new product that is totally unique from all other hangover products on the market today that was formulated by a laboratory chemist who is an expert in the field.
The two ounce energy shots are usually placed near the counters in convenience and other stores. The Hangover Recovery Shot is also an officially licensed product of The Hangover movie series from Warner Brothers.
It all started on May 4 when HJOE announced that the Git-R-Done-Energy Drink will be featured on FYI owned by A+E Networks, a joint venture between the Disney-ABC Television Group subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company and the Hearst Corporation. Food Factory USA is a television series produced by Cineflix airing in Canada on Food Network Canada, and in the United States on FYI.
The episode featuring Git-R-Done Energy Shot will air on June 4th on FYI at 9pm EST. Larry the Cable Guy is featured in the show and explains just how to Git R Done!

Food Factory USA features the industrial production lines of major food companies. “We filmed the show in late February,” said CEO of Hangover Joe’s Matthew Veal. “These are exciting times for our new brand Git-R-Done-Energy. We are emerging as the leader in healthy energy shots and will be featuring the brand on Food Factory USA and how the product works and the behind the scene manufacturing process and the state of the manufacturing procedures of United 1 Labs our co-packer in Dallas, Texas.”
“This is really a great opportunity for our brand,” said Shawn Adamson, Co-Founder of Hangover Joe’s and Vice President of Sales & Marketing. “The timing cannot be better for the company as we will be rolling out into many more new stores and a more significant online presence across the country in 2015 and the show will expose the brand to 3 million people in this airing. Our beverage scientists will explain how the product works and why it’s a revolutionary new energy drink. Viewers will also get a firsthand, step-by-step look at the anatomy of how each healthy energy shot is made, and the ingredients and techniques that go into making them. Viewers are also treated to fun, “did you know” food facts throughout each episode.”
“When Food Factory first came to us we were really excited and surprised, knowing they have featured such companies and products as Welch’s Concord Grape Jam, Papa John pizza dough, Frito Lay Cracker Jack, and Ben & Jerry’s New York Super Fudge Chunk ice cream,” said Mike Jaynes, Co-Founder of Hangover Joe’s and Chairman of the Board.

Currently exploding up the charts on spectacular volume HJOE has little cash on hand and minimal revenues to date as well as significant rising short term debt.

We will be updating HJOE as events unfold so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what is going on with HJOE.
