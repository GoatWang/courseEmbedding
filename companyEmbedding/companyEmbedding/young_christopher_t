Young, Christopher T
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Young Christopher T carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.
Young Christopher T currently holds license 17474 (Building), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Young Christopher T



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Young Christopher T



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Young Christopher T



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Magician, Kids Show And Balloon Performer, Mar-2017, New York, Parlor Performer, Stage Magic, Vanishing Inc., Video Description Additional information Reviews (0) Product EnquiryDescriptionIf you’re looking for new routines for family entertainment, Just for Fun is a gold mine of new ideas. Christopher T. Magician combines techniques from classic close-up and parlor magic, with original props like ketchup bottles, stuffed animals, fake mustaches, and spaghetti. The result is fresh material for family shows that is contemporary, amazing, and hilarious. This hardbound book contains 325 pages of original routines. Most of the secrets rely on gimmicked props you probably own or can make inexpensively – and no power tools are necessary!Fully illustrated by Finland’s Martti Siren, Just for Fun has 50 new routines. Each one has been part of Chris’s show ever since he was one of the busiest magicians in the greater New York City area. Before you’ve even finished this book, you’ll be making a bunch of effects using tape, glue, spray adhesive, and photo paper along with lots of fun, novel items. Read about them below! The book details the scripts, handling and theory, so when you include these sure-fire routines in your set, you can be guaranteed that your young audiences will be laughing out loud.Each chapter is packed with routines and performing advice covering a wide range of categories:OPENERS – Tricks with eyeballs and eggs sprinkle this chapter. AmazeKids Danny Orleans’s favorite is “Magic Watching,” which turns a traditional warm-up into a fun game.SUCKER TRICKS – Highly interactive routines that use stuff like plastic mirrors, jump rope and ketchup and mustard bottles. You also get Chris’s advice on how to take the “sting” out of the traditional Sucker Effect, and transform the moment into pure entertainment.IT’S ON YOUR BACK – Chris is a master of making things like a tiny Teddy Bear, a cookie or a cootie end up on the magician’s back. He reveals the design of his easily-made utility prop that gets the job done, and his theory on how many times is the “right number of times” to do this in your act.ACCESSORIES – Breakaway Microphones, slap bracelets, wooden spoons, boomerangs, and plungers are all part of the brainstorming process that make up eight great bits of business that you’ll be able to make and use right away.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS I – This chapter has philosophy and six routines that rely on onstage kid volunteers. Crazy props like plastic ice cubes, gum, cheese, a money printer, a lollipop, fake mustaches and a Pringles Can (without a spring snake) are used in a totally original way.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS II – Seven “play big” routines requiring more than one helper make up this chapter. Josh Jay’s favorite is with a two-headed stuffed animal. But you’ll also learn how to do magic with a boxing nun puppet, chattering teeth, and fake ice-cream cone.CAPTIVATING MAGIC – Need a break from laughing-out-loud magic? Chris devotes this chapter to storytelling magic that engages, captivates, and keeps kids quiet. Again, original props abound when you perform with a shiny new mini-trophy, a slice of cheese, a volcano, or a magical rose.NOT-SO-TRICKY MAGIC – These seven routines use props to create moments that aren’t magical, but still get a huge amount of oohs and aahs from children. Learn what Chris does with a pair of cheap gloves, a whoopee cushion, a robotic goldfish, an ice cream carton, and a table lamp that is anything but ordinary!It’s no wonder this book has such great plots for young audiences. Author Christopher Barnes is incredibly knowledgeable and creative. A graduate of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, he was an actor and playwright before becoming a children’s performer. Now a veteran of the kid show scene, he’s lectured at KIDabra and Magi-Fest as well as local clubs nationwide. He currently lives in Los Angeles, where he continues to entertain thousands of children and their families every year. When you use Chris’s philosophy, strategies, and tricks to entertain the young and young-at-heart, you’ll experience a brand-new way to “find your funny” while performing a family show that’s Just for Fun.“It has become cliché to say that one good idea is worth the price of a book, but if that’s true, then Just for Fun is worth many times its cost! I found myself shaking my head and laughing out loud at the inventiveness and originality of some of the quirky plots presented here… I consider it a tremendously valuable addition to my magical library and I would unreservedly recommend it to anyone involved in or interested in entertaining children.” – John “Kimmo” Kimmons“Christopher T.’s thinking and originality continues to wow me! His first book, Beyond ‘Look Don’t See,’ is a masterwork workbook, and I consider Just for Fun his triumphant Part 2. Warning! Spending time with this book could result in a treasure trove of ideas for your shows!… Keep it in easy reach for constant inspiration.” – Mark Daniel, KIDabraPlease follow and like us:  Additional informationWeight1.9 lbsDimensions10.25 x 7.25 x 1.0 inReviewsThere are no reviews yet.

Magician, Kids Show And Balloon Performer, Mar-2017, New York, Parlor Performer, Stage Magic, Vanishing Inc., Video Description Additional information Reviews (0) Product EnquiryDescriptionIf you’re looking for new routines for family entertainment, Just for Fun is a gold mine of new ideas. Christopher T. Magician combines techniques from classic close-up and parlor magic, with original props like ketchup bottles, stuffed animals, fake mustaches, and spaghetti. The result is fresh material for family shows that is contemporary, amazing, and hilarious. This hardbound book contains 325 pages of original routines. Most of the secrets rely on gimmicked props you probably own or can make inexpensively – and no power tools are necessary!Fully illustrated by Finland’s Martti Siren, Just for Fun has 50 new routines. Each one has been part of Chris’s show ever since he was one of the busiest magicians in the greater New York City area. Before you’ve even finished this book, you’ll be making a bunch of effects using tape, glue, spray adhesive, and photo paper along with lots of fun, novel items. Read about them below! The book details the scripts, handling and theory, so when you include these sure-fire routines in your set, you can be guaranteed that your young audiences will be laughing out loud.Each chapter is packed with routines and performing advice covering a wide range of categories:OPENERS – Tricks with eyeballs and eggs sprinkle this chapter. AmazeKids Danny Orleans’s favorite is “Magic Watching,” which turns a traditional warm-up into a fun game.SUCKER TRICKS – Highly interactive routines that use stuff like plastic mirrors, jump rope and ketchup and mustard bottles. You also get Chris’s advice on how to take the “sting” out of the traditional Sucker Effect, and transform the moment into pure entertainment.IT’S ON YOUR BACK – Chris is a master of making things like a tiny Teddy Bear, a cookie or a cootie end up on the magician’s back. He reveals the design of his easily-made utility prop that gets the job done, and his theory on how many times is the “right number of times” to do this in your act.ACCESSORIES – Breakaway Microphones, slap bracelets, wooden spoons, boomerangs, and plungers are all part of the brainstorming process that make up eight great bits of business that you’ll be able to make and use right away.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS I – This chapter has philosophy and six routines that rely on onstage kid volunteers. Crazy props like plastic ice cubes, gum, cheese, a money printer, a lollipop, fake mustaches and a Pringles Can (without a spring snake) are used in a totally original way.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS II – Seven “play big” routines requiring more than one helper make up this chapter.

Just for Fun by Christopher T. Magician$40.00In stock  Add to cart    Add to wishlist    SKU: JUSTFORFUN Categories: Childrens Magic, Magic Books, Stage Magic, Not Discountable Tags: Christopher T. Magician, Kids Show And Balloon Performer, Mar-2017, New York, Parlor Performer, Stage Magic, Vanishing Inc., Video Description Additional information Reviews (0) Product EnquiryDescriptionIf you’re looking for new routines for family entertainment, Just for Fun is a gold mine of new ideas. Christopher T. Magician combines techniques from classic close-up and parlor magic, with original props like ketchup bottles, stuffed animals, fake mustaches, and spaghetti. The result is fresh material for family shows that is contemporary, amazing, and hilarious. This hardbound book contains 325 pages of original routines. Most of the secrets rely on gimmicked props you probably own or can make inexpensively – and no power tools are necessary!Fully illustrated by Finland’s Martti Siren, Just for Fun has 50 new routines. Each one has been part of Chris’s show ever since he was one of the busiest magicians in the greater New York City area. Before you’ve even finished this book, you’ll be making a bunch of effects using tape, glue, spray adhesive, and photo paper along with lots of fun, novel items. Read about them below! The book details the scripts, handling and theory, so when you include these sure-fire routines in your set, you can be guaranteed that your young audiences will be laughing out loud.Each chapter is packed with routines and performing advice covering a wide range of categories:OPENERS – Tricks with eyeballs and eggs sprinkle this chapter. AmazeKids Danny Orleans’s favorite is “Magic Watching,” which turns a traditional warm-up into a fun game.SUCKER TRICKS – Highly interactive routines that use stuff like plastic mirrors, jump rope and ketchup and mustard bottles. You also get Chris’s advice on how to take the “sting” out of the traditional Sucker Effect, and transform the moment into pure entertainment.IT’S ON YOUR BACK – Chris is a master of making things like a tiny Teddy Bear, a cookie or a cootie end up on the magician’s back. He reveals the design of his easily-made utility prop that gets the job done, and his theory on how many times is the “right number of times” to do this in your act.ACCESSORIES – Breakaway Microphones, slap bracelets, wooden spoons, boomerangs, and plungers are all part of the brainstorming process that make up eight great bits of business that you’ll be able to make and use right away.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS I – This chapter has philosophy and six routines that rely on onstage kid volunteers. Crazy props like plastic ice cubes, gum, cheese, a money printer, a lollipop, fake mustaches and a Pringles Can (without a spring snake) are used in a totally original way.AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION TRICKS II – Seven “play big” routines requiring more than one helper make up this chapter. Josh Jay’s favorite is with a two-headed stuffed animal. But you’ll also learn how to do magic with a boxing nun puppet, chattering teeth, and fake ice-cream cone.CAPTIVATING MAGIC – Need a break from laughing-out-loud magic? Chris devotes this chapter to storytelling magic that engages, captivates, and keeps kids quiet. Again, original props abound when you perform with a shiny new mini-trophy, a slice of cheese, a volcano, or a magical rose.NOT-SO-TRICKY MAGIC – These seven routines use props to create moments that aren’t magical, but still get a huge amount of oohs and aahs from children. Learn what Chris does with a pair of cheap gloves, a whoopee cushion, a robotic goldfish, an ice cream carton, and a table lamp that is anything but ordinary!It’s no wonder this book has such great plots for young audiences. Author Christopher Barnes is incredibly knowledgeable and creative. A graduate of New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, he was an actor and playwright before becoming a children’s performer. Now a veteran of the kid show scene, he’s lectured at KIDabra and Magi-Fest as well as local clubs nationwide. He currently lives in Los Angeles, where he continues to entertain thousands of children and their families every year. When you use Chris’s philosophy, strategies, and tricks to entertain the young and young-at-heart, you’ll experience a brand-new way to “find your funny” while performing a family show that’s Just for Fun.“It has become cliché to say that one good idea is worth the price of a book, but if that’s true, then Just for Fun is worth many times its cost! I found myself shaking my head and laughing out loud at the inventiveness and originality of some of the quirky plots presented here… I consider it a tremendously valuable addition to my magical library and I would unreservedly recommend it to anyone involved in or interested in entertaining children.” – John “Kimmo” Kimmons“Christopher T.’s thinking and originality continues to wow me! His first book, Beyond ‘Look Don’t See,’ is a masterwork workbook, and I consider Just for Fun his triumphant Part 2. Warning! Spending time with this book could result in a treasure trove of ideas for your shows!… Keep it in easy reach for constant inspiration.” – Mark Daniel, KIDabraAdditional informationWeight1.9 lbsDimensions10.25 x 7.25 x 1.0 inReviewsThere are no reviews yet.

Christopher Young

 "I don't believe an artist creates beauty, but finds it and presents it to others. In my own work, I attempt to capture the slivers of transcendence in the world around me - that moment of truth and beauty when all seems to be made clearer in a wordless revelation."
Christopher Young has loved the outdoors since he was a child. With his paintings and prints he invites the viewer to reflect on the simplicity and natural order of the world. 
Young has a fascination with seemingly ordinary objects - their configuration, function and design. These objects, such as bird's nests, exotic insects, or flowers, are the basis for his highly detailed and sensitive paintings.
