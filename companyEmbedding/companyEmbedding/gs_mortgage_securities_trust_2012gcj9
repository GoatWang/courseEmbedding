On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ9 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ9
    





October 13, 2016 05:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all rated classes of Goldman Sachs Commercial 
      Mortgage Capital, L.P., GS Mortgage Securities Trust series 2012-GCJ9 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement of the classes 
      relative to Fitch expected losses and the relatively stable performance 
      of the pool since issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.9% of the 
      remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.8%. 
      There have been no realized losses to date. Fitch has designated nine 
      loans (24%) as Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC), which includes two 
      specially serviced assets (0.8%). There are currently 14 loans on the 
      servicer's watchlist (29.9%).
    

      As of the September 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by approximately 4.8% to $1.32 
      billion from $1.39 billion at issuance. Approximately 60% of the pool's 
      loans are amortizing balloon. There are five loans scheduled to mature 
      in 2017 with a current balance of $191.5 million (14.5% of the pool), 
      including three of the top-15 loans that have had positive performance 
      since issuance. Five loans are fully defeased (2.7% of the pool). There 
      are $235,934 of interest shortfalls affecting class NR.
    

      The largest contributor to Fitch modelled losses is the Gansevoort Park 
      Avenue hotel loan (4.75% of the pool), which is secured by a boutique 
      luxury hotel located on the corner of Park Avenue and 29th Street in the 
      NoMad section of Manhattan. The loan is on the servicer's watchlist due 
      to a decline in net cash flow (NCF) since issuance. Per the year-end 
      (YE) 2015 OSAR, the NCF was 37% below the issuers underwritten NCF, with 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) declining to 1.11x for YE 2015 from 
      1.42x at YE 2014 and 1.77x at issuance. The declines are attributed to 
      increased expenses, primarily real estate taxes, which have increased to 
      $3.6 million at YE 2015, compared to $3.3 million in 2014, $2.0 million 
      in 2013, and $1.5 million at issuance. The underwritten real estate tax 
      amount was based on an approved tax appeal, but the figure has more than 
      doubled when compared to the issuer's underwriting. In addition, food & 
      beverage (F&B) income has also declined compared to issuance.
    

      Hotel room revenues remain relatively flat compared to issuance with YE 
      2015 only 2.6% below the issuer's underwritten amount. Occupancy 
      improved to 86.7% as of YE 2015, compared to 83.6% at issuance. However, 
      ADR and RevPAR both declined over the same time period, reporting at 
      $350.58 and $303.95, respectively, compared $386.83 (ADR) and $323.39 
      (RevPAR) at issuance. Although Fitch calculated losses based on in-place 
      cash flow and a stressed cap rate, losses may be mitigated given the 
      strong location and quality of the asset. Fitch is closely monitoring 
      the property's performance.
    

      Two of the top-15 loans scheduled to mature in 2017 are secured by hotel 
      portfolios: The $88.3 million Cooper Hotel Portfolio (6.7% of the pool; 
      maturing Nov. 2016) collateralized by 11 full service and limited 
      service properties in three states (FL, MI, TN), and the TMI Hotel 
      Portfolio (3.3%; maturing October 2016) secured by 10 limited service 
      and extended stay hotels in eight states (TX, AZ, OH, WY, OK, MI, WI, 
      MN). Both portfolios have experienced significant increases in cash flow 
      since issuance driven by positive operating performance, with increased 
      occupancy, ADR, and/or RevPAR at all properties. Per the 
      trailing-twelve-month (TTM) May 2016 Smith Travel Research (STR) 
      reports, the Cooper Hotel Portfolio's weighted average (WA) occupancy, 
      ADR, and RevPAR were 73.1%, $112.83, and $83, respectively, compared to 
      68.5%, $98.95, and $68.22 at issuance. Per the TTM March 2016 STR 
      reports, the TMI Hotel Portfolio's WA occupancy, ADR, and RevPar were 
      78.5%, $113.82, and $90.41, respectively, compared to 74.6%, $102.92, 
      and $76.77 at YE 2013. All of the properties in both portfolios are 
      currently outperforming or in-line with their respective comp sets.
    

      The third near-term maturing top-15 loan is the $35.0 million 222 
      Broadway loan (2.7%), maturing in June 2017. The loan is secured by a 
      31-story office tower located in Manhattan's Financial District, 
      directly south of City Hall Park, and adjacent to the new Fulton Street 
      Transit Center and one block east of the new WTC Transportation Hub. The 
      property NOI had a temporary decline in 2014 due to Bank of America (74% 
      of the NRA at issuance) exercising its contraction rights in 2013 and 
      vacating 91,609-sf, downsizing its footprint to 483,977-sf (62% NRA). In 
      2014, the contracted space and existing vacant space was leased to two 
      new tenants, Conde Nast (10.8% NRA) and WeWork(16% NRA), with rent 
      abatements built into both leases through fourth quarter 2014. Occupancy 
      was 97.5% per the March 2016 rent roll. The first quarter 2016 DSCR was 
      2.42x, compared to 2.62x at YE 2015, 1.16x at YE 2014, and 1.49x at YE 
      2013.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks for all but classes B and C are considered Stable 
      due to sufficient credit enhancement (C/E), and relatively stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. The Outlooks for classes B and C 
      are revised to Positive as C/E is expected to improve over the next 13 
      months from on-going monthly amortization and expected repayment from 
      maturing loans. Should performance across the pool continue to improve, 
      class C/E increase, and loans repay as expected, positive rating 
      migrations are possible on these classes. However, should there be 
      material economic or asset level event changes that affect the 
      transaction's portfolio-level metrics, including modelled losses 
      exceeding Fitch expectations or additional loans transferring to special 
      servicing, the classes could be subjected to negative ratings migration.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to

      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

                Case Study: The Collapse of Lehman Brothers

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ9
























CHICAGO, Oct 13, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed all rated classes of Goldman Sachs Commercial 
      Mortgage Capital, L.P., GS Mortgage Securities Trust series 2012-GCJ9 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement of the classes 
      relative to Fitch expected losses and the relatively stable performance 
      of the pool since issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.9% of the 
      remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.8%. 
      There have been no realized losses to date. Fitch has designated nine 
      loans (24%) as Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC), which includes two 
      specially serviced assets (0.8%). There are currently 14 loans on the 
      servicer's watchlist (29.9%).


                                        








As of the September 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by approximately 4.8% to $1.32 
      billion from $1.39 billion at issuance. Approximately 60% of the pool's 
      loans are amortizing balloon. There are five loans scheduled to mature 
      in 2017 with a current balance of $191.5 million (14.5% of the pool), 
      including three of the top-15 loans that have had positive performance 
      since issuance. Five loans are fully defeased (2.7% of the pool). There 
      are $235,934 of interest shortfalls affecting class NR.


                                        








The largest contributor to Fitch modelled losses is the Gansevoort Park 
      Avenue hotel loan (4.75% of the pool), which is secured by a boutique 
      luxury hotel located on the corner of Park Avenue and 29th Street in the 
      NoMad section of Manhattan. The loan is on the servicer's watchlist due 
      to a decline in net cash flow (NCF) since issuance. Per the year-end 
      (YE) 2015 OSAR, the NCF was 37% below the issuers underwritten NCF, with 
      debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) declining to 1.11x for YE 2015 from 
      1.42x at YE 2014 and 1.77x at issuance. The declines are attributed to 
      increased expenses, primarily real estate taxes, which have increased to 
      $3.6 million at YE 2015, compared to $3.3 million in 2014, $2.0 million 
      in 2013, and $1.5 million at issuance. The underwritten real estate tax 
      amount was based on an approved tax appeal, but the figure has more than 
      doubled when compared to the issuer's underwriting. In addition, food & 
      beverage (F&B) income has also declined compared to issuance.


                                        








Hotel room revenues remain relatively flat compared to issuance with YE 
      2015 only 2.6% below the issuer's underwritten amount. Occupancy 
      improved to 86.7% as of YE 2015, compared to 83.6% at issuance. However, 
      ADR and RevPAR both declined over the same time period, reporting at 
      $350.58 and $303.95, respectively, compared $386.83 (ADR) and $323.39 
      (RevPAR) at issuance. Although Fitch calculated losses based on in-place 
      cash flow and a stressed cap rate, losses may be mitigated given the 
      strong location and quality of the asset. Fitch is closely monitoring 
      the property's performance.


                                        








Two of the top-15 loans scheduled to mature in 2017 are secured by hotel 
      portfolios: The $88.3 million Cooper Hotel Portfolio (6.7% of the pool; 
      maturing Nov. 2016) collateralized by 11 full service and limited 
      service properties in three states (FL, MI, TN), and the TMI Hotel 
      Portfolio (3.3%; maturing October 2016) secured by 10 limited service 
      and extended stay hotels in eight states (TX, AZ, OH, WY, OK, MI, WI, 
      MN). Both portfolios have experienced significant increases in cash flow 
      since issuance driven by positive operating performance, with increased 
      occupancy, ADR, and/or RevPAR at all properties. Per the 
      trailing-twelve-month (TTM) May 2016 Smith Travel Research (STR) 
      reports, the Cooper Hotel Portfolio's weighted average (WA) occupancy, 
      ADR, and RevPAR were 73.1%, $112.83, and $83, respectively, compared to 
      68.5%, $98.95, and $68.22 at issuance. Per the TTM March 2016 STR 
      reports, the TMI Hotel Portfolio's WA occupancy, ADR, and RevPar were 
      78.5%, $113.82, and $90.41, respectively, compared to 74.6%, $102.92, 
      and $76.77 at YE 2013. All of the properties in both portfolios are 
      currently outperforming or in-line with their respective comp sets.


                                        








The third near-term maturing top-15 loan is the $35.0 million 222 
      Broadway loan (2.7%), maturing in June 2017. The loan is secured by a 
      31-story office tower located in Manhattan's Financial District, 
      directly south of City Hall Park, and adjacent to the new Fulton Street 
      Transit Center and one block east of the new WTC Transportation Hub. The 
      property NOI had a temporary decline in 2014 due to Bank of America (74% 
      of the NRA at issuance) exercising its contraction rights in 2013 and 
      vacating 91,609-sf, downsizing its footprint to 483,977-sf (62% NRA). In 
      2014, the contracted space and existing vacant space was leased to two 
      new tenants, Conde Nast (10.8% NRA) and WeWork(16% NRA), with rent 
      abatements built into both leases through fourth quarter 2014. Occupancy 
      was 97.5% per the March 2016 rent roll. The first quarter 2016 DSCR was 
      2.42x, compared to 2.62x at YE 2015, 1.16x at YE 2014, and 1.49x at YE 
      2013.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks for all but classes B and C are considered Stable 
      due to sufficient credit enhancement (C/E), and relatively stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. The Outlooks for classes B and C 
      are revised to Positive as C/E is expected to improve over the next 13 
      months from on-going monthly amortization and expected repayment from 
      maturing loans. Should performance across the pool continue to improve, 
      class C/E increase, and loans repay as expected, positive rating 
      migrations are possible on these classes. However, should there be 
      material economic or asset level event changes that affect the

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations reflect sufficient credit enhancement of the classes relative to Fitch expected losses and the relatively stable performance of the pool since issuance. Fitch modeled losses of 3.9% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 3.8%. There have been no realized losses to date. Fitch has designated nine loans (24%) as Fitch Loans of Concern (FLOC), which includes two specially serviced assets (0.8%). There are currently 14 loans on the servicer's watchlist (29.9%).As of the September 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by approximately 4.8% to $1.32 billion from $1.39 billion at issuance. Approximately 60% of the pool's loans are amortizing balloon. There are five loans scheduled to mature in 2017 with a current balance of $191.5 million (14.5% of the pool), including three of the top-15 loans that have had positive performance since issuance. Five loans are fully defeased (2.7% of the pool). There are $235,934 of interest shortfalls affecting class NR.The largest contributor to Fitch modelled losses is the Gansevoort Park Avenue hotel loan (4.75% of the pool), which is secured by a boutique luxury hotel located on the corner of Park Avenue and 29th Street in the NoMad section of Manhattan. The loan is on the servicer's watchlist due to a decline in net cash flow (NCF) since issuance. Per the year-end (YE) 2015 OSAR, the NCF was 37% below the issuers underwritten NCF, with debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) declining to 1.11x for YE 2015 from 1.42x at YE 2014 and 1.77x at issuance. The declines are attributed to increased expenses, primarily real estate taxes, which have increased to $3.6 million at YE 2015, compared to $3.3 million in 2014, $2.0 million in 2013, and $1.5 million at issuance. The underwritten real estate tax amount was based on an approved tax appeal, but the figure has more than doubled when compared to the issuer's underwriting. In addition, food & beverage (F&B) income has also declined compared to issuance.Hotel room revenues remain relatively flat compared to issuance with YE 2015 only 2.6% below the issuer's underwritten amount. Occupancy improved to 86.7% as of YE 2015, compared to 83.6% at issuance. However, ADR and RevPAR both declined over the same time period, reporting at $350.58 and $303.95, respectively, compared $386.83 (ADR) and $323.39 (RevPAR) at issuance. Although Fitch calculated losses based on in-place cash flow and a stressed cap rate, losses may be mitigated given the strong location and quality of the asset. Fitch is closely monitoring the property's performance.Two of the top-15 loans scheduled to mature in 2017 are secured by hotel portfolios: The $88.3 million Cooper Hotel Portfolio (6.7% of the pool; maturing Nov. 2016) collateralized by 11 full service and limited service properties in three states (FL, MI, TN), and the TMI Hotel Portfolio (3.3%; maturing October 2016) secured by 10 limited service and extended stay hotels in eight states (TX, AZ, OH, WY, OK, MI, WI, MN). Both portfolios have experienced significant increases in cash flow since issuance driven by positive operating performance, with increased occupancy, ADR, and/or RevPAR at all properties. Per the trailing-twelve-month (TTM) May 2016 Smith Travel Research (STR) reports, the Cooper Hotel Portfolio's weighted average (WA) occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR were 73.1%, $112.83, and $83, respectively, compared to 68.5%, $98.95, and $68.22 at issuance. Per the TTM March 2016 STR reports, the TMI Hotel Portfolio's WA occupancy, ADR, and RevPar were 78.5%, $113.82, and $90.41, respectively, compared to 74.6%, $102.92, and $76.77 at YE 2013. All of the properties in both portfolios are currently outperforming or in-line with their respective comp sets.The third near-term maturing top-15 loan is the $35.0 million 222 Broadway loan (2.7%), maturing in June 2017. The loan is secured by a 31-story office tower located in Manhattan's Financial District, directly south of City Hall Park, and adjacent to the new Fulton Street Transit Center and one block east of the new WTC Transportation Hub. The property NOI had a temporary decline in 2014 due to Bank of America (74% of the NRA at issuance) exercising its contraction rights in 2013 and vacating 91,609-sf, downsizing its footprint to 483,977-sf (62% NRA). In 2014, the contracted space and existing vacant space was leased to two new tenants, Conde Nast (10.8% NRA) and WeWork(16% NRA), with rent abatements built into both leases through fourth quarter 2014. Occupancy was 97.5% per the March 2016 rent roll. The first quarter 2016 DSCR was 2.42x, compared to 2.62x at YE 2015, 1.16x at YE 2014, and 1.49x at YE 2013.Read MoreRATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks for all but classes B and C are considered Stable due to sufficient credit enhancement (C/E), and relatively stable performance of the pool since issuance. The Outlooks for classes B and C are revised to Positive as C/E is expected to improve over the next 13 months from on-going monthly amortization and expected repayment from maturing loans. Should performance across the pool continue to improve, class C/E increase, and loans repay as expected, positive rating migrations are possible on these classes. However, should there be material economic or asset level event changes that affect the transaction's portfolio-level metrics, including modelled losses exceeding Fitch expectations or additional loans transferring to special servicing, the classes could be subjected to negative ratings migration.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings and revised Rating Outlooks as indicated:GS Mortgage Securities Trust series 2012-GCJ9--$6.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$202.5 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$607.4 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$90 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$111.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$90.3 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable;--$57.3 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable;--$57.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$27.8 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$22.6 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.Fitch does not rate the interest-only class X-B or the $50.3 million class G.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchGS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GCJ9 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/710213Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013100Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013100Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
