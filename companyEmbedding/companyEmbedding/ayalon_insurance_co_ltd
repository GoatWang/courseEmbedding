About Brent Fulk, your San Jose insurance agent.
Hi, my name is Brent Fulk. I have been an insurance agent with GEICO since 2003 and your local San Jose insurance agent since 2007. My office serves the Silicon Valley Area, from Fremont to San Mateo, and Monterey through the South Bay. We can help insure your home and auto as well as your motorcycle, boat, and RV.
The San Jose agents are here to help.
We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi. When you get a quote through our office, we'll make sure all your eligible discounts are applied. We make doing business with GEICO easy for you.
Spot Brent and his team in the community.
I'm a member of the Campbell Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Silicon Valley, and the Silicon Valley Capital Club. I also coach in the Almaden Little League.
Look for our San Jose insurance agents at local events such as the San Jose Sharks Street Rally or at San Jose State University football games. My office is also a drop-off site during the holidays for the Harvest Food Bank and for the USMC Toys for Tots. Stop by and say "hello!"
Find Your Way To The San Jose Location
