Madar, Jean - The Wall Street Transcript











































 





































Jean  Madar
JEAN MADAR is the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board
of Directors, co-Founder and the largest stockholder of Inter
Parfums, Inc. In 1985, with his business plan for alternative
designer fragrances and a few thousand dollars, Mr. Madar
traveled from Paris to New York City and formed the company’s
predecessor, Jean Philippe Fragrances. About three years later,
the company completed its initial public offering, which was one
of the first IPOs after the October 1987 stock market crash.
While building the mass market fragrance and cosmetic business in
the United States and acquiring the rights to such brands names
as Jordache, Intimate and Aziza, Mr. Madar, along with fellow
Founder, Philippe Benacin, expanded into the prestige fragrance
business in Paris. Much of the prestige fragrance is conducted
through Paris-Bourse publicly traded Inter Parfums, SA, which is
78% owned by IPAR. Today, the company’s prestige brand portfolio
is comprised of Burberry, S.T. Dupont, Paul Smith, Christian
Lacroix, Celine, FUBU and Diane von Furstenberg. In 1999, LVMH
Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, the world’s largest luxury goods
conglomerate, became a strategic partner and 20% equity holder of
IPAR. Born in Paris, Mr. Madar is a past recipient of the Ernst &
Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award, and a graduate of ESSEC in
1983.

Greetings, and welcome to the Inter Parfums' First Quarter 2017 Conference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Russell Greenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Inter Parfums. Thank you, Mr. Greenberg. You may begin.
Russell Greenberg
Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to our 2017 first quarter conference call. As usual, I will begin the call with a financial overview. And then, Jean Madar, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss current business, recent developments and upcoming plans. After that, we will take your questions.
Before proceeding further, I want to remind listeners that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results.
These factors include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed under the headings Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and the reports we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to, and undertake no duty, to update the information discussed.
In addition, Regulation G, which is codifications for the use of non-GAAP financial measures, prescribes the condition for use of non-GAAP financial information in public disclosures. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial information included in this discussion is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for investors.
The information required to be disclosed for the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is disclosed in our March 31, 2017 quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This information is available on our website at www.interparfumsinc.com.
When we refer to European-based operations, we primarily talking about sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our 73%-owned French subsidiary, Interparfums SA. When we discuss our United States-based operations, we are primarily referring to the sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries.
Moving on to comparable first quarter results, net sales were $143.1 million, up 28.3% from $111.5 million. At comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 30.6%. Sales by European based operations rose 29.9% to $119.7 million from $92.1 million. Sales by U.S. based operations increased 20.4% to $23.4 million, compared to $19.4 million.
Gross margin was 63% of net sales, compared to 63.9%. And SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was 44.7%, compared to last year's 48.3%. Operating income was $26.2 million, up 49.3%, compared to $17.5 million. Operating margin was 18.3% compared to 15.7%; and, net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. was $13.4 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $7.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share.
As previously reported, net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. in the 2016 first quarter included a non-recurring settlement of $1.9 million tax assessment with the French tax authorities. Excluding the effect of the settlement, 2016 first quarter net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. was $8.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share. We covered key sales drivers in our releases, so I will concentrate this discussion on profitability factors. For European operations, gross profit margin was 65.5% and 67.3% in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively.

The overall decrease in gross margin is a result of product mix and increased cost relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions. For European operations, such promotions aggregated $9.4 million and $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and represented 7.8% and 7.4% of net sales respectively.
I should also point out that the average dollar/euro exchange rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.06 as compared to $1.10 for the 2016 period, which added approximately $1.3 million to gross margin, but that was offset by approximately $1.4 million of inventory sold to the Balmain brand at cost in connection with the license buyout.
For U.S. operations, gross profit margin was 50.1% and 48.2% in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively, with margin expansion primarily due to increased sales of higher margin prestige products under license.
SG&A expenses increased 19% and represented 44.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017, as compared to 48.3% in the first quarter of last year. For European operations, SG&A rose 18% and for U.S. operations SG&A rose 20%.
Promotion and advertising included in SG&A aggregated approximately $22.9 million or 16% of net sales for the 2017 first quarter, and that compares to $16.1 million or 14.5% of net sales for the same period one year earlier. The increase related to the new product launches and rollouts in the current first quarter. Operating income rose 49% and our operating margin in the current first quarter was 18.3% compared to last year's 15.7%.
We closed the quarter with working capital of $344 million including approximately $226 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $70.2 million of long-term debt including current maturities, which was incurred in connection with the 2015 Rochas brand acquisition.
Finally, assuming the dollar remains at current levels. We expect 2017 net sales to be in the $550 million and $560 million range. And net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. to be between $1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share.
Jean, please continue.
Jean Madar
Thank you, Russ, and good morning, everyone. As we have already said, this was an exceptional quarter that holds true for sales by geographic markets. Our two largest markets, Western Europe and North America, both achieved 22% year-over-year sales growth, while our third largest, Asia, grew sales by 31%. Even our smaller markets, the Middle East, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe had comparable quarter sales growth specifically 43%, 13% and more than 100% respectively.
One thing we know firsthand is that our commitment to maintaining or perhaps gaining market share for advertising and promotion in two difficult markets of 2016, mainly China and Russia, has paid off very well this year. For the remainder of the year, our launch plans include the third Legend pillar for Montblanc, called Legend Night that will debut at the end of this year and rollout further in 2018.
We've got a first Coach scent for men debuting also in the fall. And as I pointed out on our last conference call, we are repositioning our Lagerfeld fragrance enterprise to be more accessible, more democratic and affordable, starting with a new fragrance duo this year.
For Lanvin, we are readying a new interpretation of our top selling Eclat d'Arpege, I will also give you a peek into 2018 plans, which includes our first new men's scent for Rochas along with extension for Jimmy Choo Illicit, Eclat d'Arpege and Coach for women.
Moving onto the U.S. operations, Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister fragrances have been and are expected to continue to be the growth catalyst in 2017 and also in 2018. In March, our women's edition of Abercrombie & Fitch, First Instinct debuted exclusively at Worldwide [ph] Duty Free in the UK and the international rollout is now underway. Hollister Wave 2 launched this spring and is now in broad geographic distribution.

We also have a new Dunhill fragrance called Icon Racing launching later this year. And for Oscar de la Rent, the new fragrance called Bella Blanca will hit the market very later this year and early next year. We also have several new products planned for our other niche brands including Agent Provocateur and bebe.
With turnaround in Asia for Anna Sui, especially in China, we have a new fragrance called Fantasia [ph] that will debut later this year, and will target China as well as the greater Asian market.
Before taking your questions, I'd like to share some of our thoughts about our industry and our place within it. If you Google, fragrance launches of 2016, you will find 1,685 new entries coming up on one website. I know there is a lot of hype around new fragrance launch, but in our experience new is good, but longevity is much better.
Recurring sales of fragrance that are on the market for years, achieved significant returns for us. And we have a number of these successes in our portfolio. We will continue to fortify these fragrance gems with brand extension and flankers as well as new packaging and inspired promotion.
We saw a recent report indicating that the global fragrance industry was valued at approximately $46 billion in 2016. While the industry's five year compound annual growth rate contracted 1.3%. During that timeframe, our net sales compounded annual growth rate was 11%. I think that says something about our ability to buck trends, and market share, and grow our company.
We look to the remainder of the year with confidence in knowing we have a rich and diverse portfolio of brand. We have the financial strength to partner with acquire or license additional brands. We have an effective distribution network reaching more than 100 countries. And in several of the most important markets, we own or control the distribution organizations. And of course, we have a great talent and resource reservoir.
Now operator, you can open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Joseph Altobello
Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Jean Madar
Hi, Joe.
Joseph Altobello
First question, I guess, just curious, obviously a strong start to the year, how does the first quarter compare to what you guys were expecting internally, since you didn't update your guidance?
Russell Greenberg
I'm sorry. Can you just repeat that for a second? I didn't hear the end of your...
Joseph Altobello
Yes, I was just curious how the first quarter compare to your internal expectations coming into the year?
Russell Greenberg
Overall, I think that the first quarter was pretty much in line from a sales standpoint. There were a couple of brands that did a little bit better. But knowing what our launch schedule was, the first quarter was actually probably the easiest comparison if you look back to what we've done in the first quarter of 2016. So from an overall standpoint, it's pretty much in line with what we expected.
Joseph Altobello
Okay. You also mentioned that, you're saying improved trends in Russia and China. How much of that is the market improvement? How much of that is increased spending on the part of Inter Parfums?
Jean Madar
I think we have a conjunction of both. You remember, that for the last, I will say at least 24 months the Chinese market for fragrance was depressed. But we have continued to invest in promotion and in keeping our shelf space. And when I see the comeback from the market in the first quarter and continuing into second quarter, and we have also a better idea for this going to happen for the year, we are very - how should I say, relieved regarding our business in China.

Russia, I will say is similar. We have decided to continue to spend heavily in Russia. We'll do some TV campaigns as early as August or September. So it's a - I will say that the environment is much better and our business is quite good.
Joseph Altobello
Okay, great. Just one last question. And I apologize, if I missed this. The coming of the launch of Legend Night, is it late this year or early next year?
Jean Madar
We will ship Legend Night in the fourth quarter of this year. We will ship Coach for men in the third quarter of this year. This is the plan we have.
Joseph Altobello
Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Jean Madar
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Frank Camma with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Frank Camma
Good morning, guys.
Jean Madar
Good morning.
Frank Camma
A question I have on Coach. I mean, you've gotten off to a good start, but it seems to me, and maybe I'm biased because I'm a U.S. consumer, but I mean it seems to me to be one of your best recognized brands, at least U.S.-based. Is there anything that would stop you from maybe pushing advertising spend, maybe a little harder to ramp up sales there, just kind of curious on where that can go over time?
Jean Madar
The budget, our advertising budget for Coach is very, very high comparing to sales. You do - maybe you don't see - we are spending in the U.S., but don't forget we're also spending in other market where the brand is maybe less strong. We're spending in Europe and we are also spending in Asia, where the brand has great recognition.
But as a percentage of sales, I can tell you that the amount of advertising and marketing that we are spending on Coach is quite high.
Frank Camma
Okay. My second question is for Russ. Russ, you called out a number of factors for the gross margin. But the one that stuck out to me is the - you mentioned in the press release and what you mentioned about the purchase, the gift purchases. I don't remember you calling that out before in the first quarter at least. I mean, that's typically like a 3Q thing, right?
Can you just explain why that was particularly, because it wasn't really a dramatic change as a percentage of sales, like why that had an impact on the quarter?
Russell Greenberg
You're right. Normally, when we talk about purchase with purchase, and gift with purchases, we talk about during the holiday season or certainly during the third quarter because that's where a significant amount of that spending takes place. But we do have programs that we do throughout the year. And because of some of the launches that we've had, there was more of it in the first quarter this year than we had in prior years, and I just wanted to point that out as one of the reasons for the small decline in margin.
The margin decline in the European operations was relatively small, especially when you take into account this [$4 million] [ph] of the Balmain brand at cost.
Frank Camma
Right, right.
Russell Greenberg
So I was really just looking for reasons to explain why the margin declined a little bit in a period where your dollar gained a little bit of strength, because one might have thought it should have gone the other way. So I was really kind of drawing at things to explain.
Frank Camma
Okay. I understood. Okay. Just to kind of clarify, like, we should still expect there should - you would have your typical seasonal pattern with gift sets in 3Q, I would assume, I mean barring anything unusual.
Russell Greenberg
That's correct. Your gift sets are a little bit different than your purchase with purchase, and gift with purchase kind of promotions.
Frank Camma
I got you. Okay. Thank you.
Russell Greenberg
No problem, Frank.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.

Jason Gere
Thanks. Good morning. I guess, I want to go back to the EPS guidance. And I know that it's early in the season, but not changing after what seemed to be a nice beat, does imply that the rest of the year that earnings would be down year-over-year. So I guess, if I dissect that a little bit, I guess I'm trying to understand is your A&P expense beyond the 20% that I think you guys talked about. Do you not see SG&A - or is SG&A going to go higher, are there other like investments in capabilities like e-commerce or things like that that you need to do.
So again I understand why you didn't raise guidance after this quarter. But I guess, I'm trying to understand and peel back the layers of the onion to look at should we expect earnings to be down year-over-year for the rest of the year based on what the guidance implies?
Russell Greenberg
Well, if I'm correct, and I could be wrong, the guidance implies somewhere either plus or minus 1% depending upon which part of the range that you're in as far as the earnings guidance. But I think it's more difficult than that. What drives the earnings is really your sales volume, all right. And this is where we really need to be a little bit conservative as we move into Q2, Q3, and Q4.
We are comparing ourselves to significant growth that we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 of 2016. To give you an example, European operations in Q2 of 2016 grew 15%. The U.S. operations were up 15%. In Q3, Europe was 12%, U.S. was 19%, all right. In Q4, Europe was 13% and the U.S. was 17%. This was all driven by major launches of Coach, of Rochas, of Abercrombie and Hollister. These are creating very, very difficult comparisons.
Now we are hopeful that we will continue to show growth in the sales line. But going into these periods, we really need to be very, very conservative, because these are very difficult comparisons to deal with. So far - I mean don't get me wrong. April looks really good. The sales are a little bit better that we originally expected. But I can extrapolate that to the rest of the year - or we can't extrapolate that to the rest of the year, not yet.
We need a little bit more visibility as far as what is actually happening in the marketplace. We do have a lot of launches this year, but many of them are brand extensions and flankers. And it's going to be very difficult to compare with some of the major launches that we had last year.
Jason Gere
And I understand that. And I guess, the question is in the first quarter, what percentage of all new innovation came out in the first quarter versus the whole year. So did we see 30% or 40% of all the new launches come out in the first or is it going to - I know you talked a little bit about Coach in the third quarter and Legend I think in the fourth quarter, but I was just…
Russell Greenberg
Jason, the point that you're missing is, the first quarter of 2017, when you compare it to first quarter of 2016, for U.S. operations for example, we did not have any sales of Abercrombie and Hollister in Q1 of 2016, all right? And in Q2 - in Q1 2017, you have significant sales, all right? Same thing with Coach, Coach was launched in the second quarter - I'm sorry, in the third quarter of 2016. So for European operations you had zero sales of Coach product in Q1 of 2016. That's what made the comparison so much easier for Q1 and it makes it much more difficult for Q2, Q3 and Q4 or as the year goes on.
Jason Gere
That's fair. Okay. So the sales side I get. So then in terms from an EPS, and obviously the sales drives the leverage, obviously we saw it in the first quarter, are you still thinking about 20% or are you thinking about spending on A&P, maybe a little bit more on the digital side? Just wondering, if you could kind of parcel out little bit some of the margin factors that kind of play into the EPS guidance?

Russell Greenberg
Yes, I think we said it at the end of the first quarter that on a full-year basis, we expect A&P to be somewhere around 20%. If you remember last year, I thought it would be 21%. We came in at 20%. I think that 20% overall is probably a very reasonable number.
Jason Gere
Okay. And then the other question, anything just on the e-commerce side? I know obviously in beauty, there is a lot of talk about the U.S. department stores. And the good news is that you guys have - I think your exposure is probably less than many out there. So can you maybe talk about how you guys are looking at alternative channels to maybe offset some of what I think are just headwinds for a lot of manufacturers who sell into the U.S. department store channel?
Jean Madar
Russ, you want to…
Russell Greenberg
Yes, I can. Yes, of course, the trend is always there that is less traffic in the U.S. department stores. And it's somewhat being replaced by companies like Ulta and Sephora. E-commerce is a very interesting market. And I think we've talked about it briefly in the past. This is something that we are very much looking into and looking to see how e-commerce can be used effectively within our organization. That we do have some things that are planned, but I'm not prepared really to go into too much detail on that at the present time.
But clearly, I think that e-commerce is definitely something that is clearly the trend of the day if you will or the trend of at least this decade. So we'd be remiss if we weren't looking into opportunities that could utilize social media and e-commerce.
Jason Gere
Okay. I appreciate. Thanks for answering all my questions.
Russell Greenberg
No problem.
Jean Madar
Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser of D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
Linda Bolton Weiser
Thanks. Hi. So can you just comment on sort of the M&A environment in the fragrance area. Coty has closed its deal with Procter & Gamble Beauty and seems to be starting to accelerate maybe some of its portfolio review. Are you actively looking at potential deals and how are you thinking about your balance sheet cash? I mean, you've had the high cash balance for several years and sometimes new licenses don't require a cash, upfront. So how are you thinking about what you may do with that cash balance here now that it's been kind of here for quite a few years?
Jean Madar
I'm going to try to answer that. So it's public information that Coty wants to divest some brands. But I will not make any more comments on that. We are always looking, with the cash that we have in our balance sheet, we are of course looking for acquiring names or licensing names. So I will say that the M&A environment is a little bit more open due to this Coty proposed divestiture. But we get offers. We get offers from brands on - not on a daily basis, but on a weekly or monthly basis. And again, in order to keep the portfolio very, very strong, we are very selective. So we need to get - we are okay with a smaller brand. If we see the potential, we have the possibility to grow without increasing our G&A.
So for us this is - we spend a lot and lot of time looking at possibility to grow like that. Russ, you want to add something?
Russell Greenberg
Yes, the only thing I would add is that, Linda, you're a 100% correct. Many times on new licenses, if there is not existing distribution then typically the upfront payments would be almost nothing. But if you are looking to make an acquisition of an existing brand that has existing distribution that may - maybe it is with Coty or some other licensee at the current time. They're based upon, or depending on the size of the business, the number of years remaining on the license, it could require a sizeable upfront payment if you will.

We are still committed that we know that the most accreted use of our cash is if we can put it to use in buying opportunities that can add to our portfolio. And we continue to search out and be opportunistic to the extent that we can. As Jean said, that there was a lot of deals. Go ahead, Jean.
Jean Madar
Yes, I would like to add that I'm very comfortable having $250 million or close to $250 million cash in the bank, not because we'll be happy to have it. And when we decide to make an acquisition for a large one, for $500 million or even more, so this will put us in a different category without any stress. We are looking at medium size business, but we could also integrate larger size business, so that's why I think it's very important keep this cash in our balance sheet.
Linda Bolton Weiser
Okay. And then…
Jean Madar
Okay, Linda.
Linda Bolton Weiser
Yes, can I ask you about the Jimmy Choo? I think Jimmy Choo is in the process of being sold. Does that represent any kind of a risk to your license agreement or does that carry through under the new potential…?
Russell Greenberg
No, our license agreement would continue. If I'm not correct, Jean, I think the license agreement goes through at least 2023, 2024.
Jean Madar
Yes, so we have at least five more years with - in front of us. Jimmy Choo is doing very well. We have great relationship with the Jimmy Choo company. We showed them that we are able to do well. We started - this is a business which started from scratch. We've been doing - can we disclose the number, Russ, by brand?
Russell Greenberg
Yes, Jimmy, we did - in 2016, we did $90.4 million in Jimmy Choo sales.
Jean Madar
So it will be above a $100 million business or it's quite important. The revenue from license from Jimmy Choo are quite important and the relationship is good. So we expect to - no issues with the sale of - the potential sales of Jimmy Choo.
Linda Bolton Weiser
Okay. Thank you very much.
Russell Greenberg
Thank you, Linda.
Jean Madar
Thank you. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Hamed Khorsand of BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question.
Hamed Khorsand
Hi, good morning. So first off, is there an update as to when Coach would be released in Japan?
Jean Madar
This year for sure.
Hamed Khorsand
Okay. Is there a reason why you haven't been able to releasing it yet?
Jean Madar
It was a plan decision from the beginning. So we do not see a - you know what, Coach is very important. The brand is very important in Japan. But Japan is not a huge market for fragrance. But the U.S. is the main market today. And we are - we will be in most of the Japanese partner stores this year.
Hamed Khorsand
Okay. And then, any plans to release more multi-scents and really just take up on the trend of - with millennials as far as just buying smaller vials that have higher margin?
Jean Madar
I don't think I got that. Can you repeat it, please?
Hamed Khorsand
Yes, so there is this growing trend with millennials as far as buying smaller vials multi-scents with different scents of the brands. So they're being sold with higher margin mark-up. So is there any plans on your end to release…
Jean Madar
We have collections - we do have collections like that in most of our programs. It's definitely a trend that we are participating into.
Hamed Khorsand
Okay. All right, and then, as far as the gross margin outlook goes with EPS, just given where marketing is now, I mean, are you - the profits that you recorded this quarter, I mean, it sounds like you're just going to reinvest them at a higher rate just because this quarter was stronger. I mean, is that a good way to interpret it?
Jean Madar
Russ?
Russell Greenberg
Well, in the first quarter, if you're not dealing with a real - holiday type issues with respect to your advertising budget. As you heard before, we expect to spend somewhere around 20% for the full year. Here in the first quarter, we spent 16% of sales. And yet - and the sales represented, what is it - something like 26% of our annual sales. So clearly, the bulk of our ad spending comes later in the year, predominantly in the third quarter. So it's not a question of reinvesting the profits from the first quarter. We're constantly reinvesting money into the brands in the form of advertising.

I don't think anything has changed because of the results here on this particular first quarter.
Hamed Khorsand
Okay. All right, thank you.
Russell Greenberg
Thanks, Hamed.
Jean Madar
Thank you.
Operator
There are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Russell Greenberg for closing comments.

Greetings, and welcome to the Inter Parfums’ Fourth Quarter 2016 Conference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I’d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Russell Greenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for Inter Parfums. Please go ahead, sir.
Russell Greenberg
Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to our 2016 year-end conference call. As usual, I will begin the call with a financial overview and then Jean Madar, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss current business, recent developments and upcoming plans. After that, we will take your questions.
Before proceeding further, I want to remind listeners that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results.
These factors include but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading forward-looking statements and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, and the reports we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to, and undertake no duty, to update the information discussed.
In addition, Regulation G codifications for the use of non-GAAP financial measures, prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information in public disclosures. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial information included in this discussion is important supplemental measures of operating performance to investors.
The information required to be disclosed for the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is disclosed in our December 31, 2016 annual report on Form 10-K which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This information is available on our Web site at www.interparfumsinc.com.
When we refer to our European-based operations, we are primarily talking about sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our 73%-owned French subsidiary, Interparfums SA. When we discuss our United States-based operations, we are primarily referring to the sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.
Now moving on to comparable fourth quarter results. Net sales were $134.8 million, up 13.9% from $118.3 million. At comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 15.3%. Sales by European-based operations rose 12.8% to $99.9 million from $88.6 million. And at comparable foreign currency exchange rates, net sales increased 14.6%.
For United States-based operations, we generated net sales of $34.9 million, up 17.3% from $29.7 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 63.7% of net sales as compared to 64%. SG&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, was 59% compared to 60.4%.
Operating income rose 26.5% to $5.4 million from $4.3 million. Net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. rose 111% to $3.9 million compared to $1.9 million. And net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. per diluted share rose 117% to $0.13 from $0.06. Thus, full year net sales increased 11.2% to $521.1 million from $468.5 million in 2015. At comparable currency exchange rates, those net sales increased to 12.1%.

You will recall that our first quarter results included the effect of a pending settlement of a tax assessment with the French tax authorities of $1.9 million or $1.4 million net of non-controlling interest. Thus, in 2016, net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. was $33.3 million or $1.07 per diluted share, inclusive of the tax settlement and $34.7 million or $1.11 per diluted share, exclusive of the tax settlement. Net income attributable to Inter Parfums, Inc. in 2015 was $30.4 million or $0.98 per diluted share.
We covered key sales drivers in our releases, so I will focus on certain profitability factors. As I just mentioned, our consolidated gross margin for the 2016 fourth quarter was 63.7% of net sales, which looks a lot like the gross margin achieved in the first and second quarters. As you may recall, in the third quarter, we shipped significantly more holiday gift-sets and other promotional items, which were sold at lower margins than regular merchandise, which happened to have depressed gross margins for that third quarter. But for the full year, gross margin was 62.7% of net sales, up from 2015’s 61.8%.
SG&A expenses increased 11.3% and represented 59% of net sales for the final quarter of 2016, as compared to 60.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, SG&A expenses increased 13% as compared to 2015. And as a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 50% in 2016 as compared to 49% in 2015. The increase is primarily related to higher promotion and advertising expenses.
As planned, we invested heavily in advertising and promotion to support new product launches, as well as to build worldwide awareness for our portfolio brands. In 2016, promotion and advertising included in SG&A expenses, aggregated $99 million or 19% of net sales, and that’s up from $83.8 million or 17.9% of net sales in 2015. There were two non-recurring items that were included in our fourth quarter and full year operating results. One that benefits and the other detracts from operating income.
In December, we reached an agreement with the Balmain brand, calling for the buyout of the Balmain license agreement, effective December 31, 2016 in exchange for a payment of $5.7 million. As a result, we recognized a gain of $4.7 million in the fourth quarter. Payment is expected by the end of April. And once our three month inventory sell-off period terminates on March 31, 2017, Balmain has agreed to purchase all remaining inventory and tangible assets.
The second item relates to the Karl Lagerfeld brand, for which product sales had not met with our original expectations. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we decided that we will likely exercise our rights for an early termination of the Karl Lagerfeld license in 2014, rather than continue the license through its original expiration in 2032. As a result of this shortened expected life, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.7 million for 2016. And I am sure that John will talk more about our plans with respect to the Karl Lagerfeld license in his remarks.
Moving on to our balance sheet, we closed the year with working capital of $338 million, including approximately $256 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our long-term debt, including current maturities, aggregated $74.6 million at December 31st. Jean, please continue.
Jean Madar
Thank you, Russ and good morning everyone. I am very pleased with our financial performance for 2016. I would like to point out that with 257 full-time employees worldwide, Inter Parfums generated $521 million in sales in 2016, which equates to almost $5 million in sales to employee, which is quite an achievement.
I am also proud that we have grown our business in our two largest markets, which are Western Europe, where sales grew by 23.5% and North America where sales increased 19% over year-over-year. In Asia, our third largest market, sales were 4% ahead of 2015. And as I noted on our third quarter conference call, Korea and Japan are making up some of the shortfall in China where the market remains depressed.

Our next three markets are just about the same in size give or take a few million dollars; Central and South America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And for the year as a whole, our sales in Eastern Europe were down from last year, owing to Russia’s economic problems, resulting from lower oil prices and a devalued currency.
Before reporting on our 2017 line-up, I want to remind listeners that the 2016 growth drivers for European operation were coming from Montblanc, Rochas and Coach Brands. And for U.S. operation it was coming from Hollister, Abercrombie and Dunhill.
Moving on to our launch schedule for 2017. For Montblanc, we have the third Legend pillar, called Legend Night that will debut at the end of this year and roll out further in 2018. You may have seen a large piece in Women’s wear daily, where our second Legend flanker, Legend Spirit, was among the top five new fragrance launches in the U.S. in 2016. And our new Coach signature fragrance for women, also made the list. We’ve got our first Coach scent for men debuting in the fall of this year, and we’re continuing the rollout of the Coach signature scents, both the Eau de Parfum, primarily for the Western market, and Eau de Toilette geared for Asia, where the scent is unveiling in two major markets, China and Japan, this year.
For Jimmy Choo, we have two initiatives in the work; one is an extension of a signature scents for women; and the other is an extension for Jimmy Choo Man. For Lanvin, the international rollout of Modern Princess is continuing, and we are preparing still another interpretation of Eclat d'Arpege, our premier Lanvin scent. We’re also very excited about Mademoiselle Rochas, our first new scent for the brand Rochas, which is initially debuting in 12 countries in the first half of 2017, followed by further international geographic rollout in the second half of 2017.
For Boucheron, we have six scents collection coming to market. And for Van Cleef, we are adding a new juice to the collection Extraordinaire line. We also have some new ideas for the Karl Lagerfeld brand. We will introduce two new fragrances, men and women, this year for Karl Lagerfeld at more democratic prices. And we plan to reinvigorate this brand by changing the positioning and introducing this new jewel that I was talking about, where they will be introduced during the summer.
Moving on to the U.S. operations, Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister fragrances should continue to be growth catalysts in 2017. As we have pointed out, in international markets, these names are viewed as American fashion brand, so they are being sold in perfumeries, beauty boutiques, departmental and specialty stores and of course, travel retail.
This month, we have the women’s edition of Abercrombie, First Instinct, debuting exclusively at World Duty Free in the UK, where it is doing extremely well. From April, next month, the international rollout begins. We also have a new dual launching internationally for Hollister. And Dunhill, we'll be launching Desire Extreme this year, and Oscar de la Renta will have also a new fragrance for women, called Bella Blanca, that will be hitting the market later this year. So as you can see, we have a lot of launches in 2017. And I was going to forget Anna Sui, which will have also a new fragrance introduced in the third quarter of 2017.
So to summarize, with our rich and diverse portfolio of brands, we are not dependent on one or two for our growth or success. We also recognize that all brands are not treated equal. Cutting ties with smaller brands can be the right move at the right time. At the same time, we are also on the lookout for additional brands to partner with or to license or to acquire. We’ve got the balance sheet to make that happen. Our primary focus, both in Europe and U.S., is on growing our high margin prestige fragrance business, and that is also the focus of our acquisition strategy.

We have an effective efficient distribution network, reaching 100 countries and in several of the most important markets, we own or control the distribution organizations. And of course, we have a great talent and resource reservoir.
So now, operator, you can open the floor for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting the question-answer-session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with B Riley. Please proceed with your questions.
Linda Bolton Weiser
You have quite a line-up of new launches for 2017. Can you just, I don’t know if you said the timing of the two Jimmy Choo launches, the man and the women. What’s the timing of those?
Jean Madar
Jimmy Choo, so we are launching as we speak this quarter, the extension of the women’s fragrance, called Jimmy Choo Loo. And the men’s extension will be launched in the third quarter. And if you’re talking about Jimmy Choo, I can tell you that for the first two months of the year, we are doing very well. We are very opportunistic on our business of Jimmy Choo.
Linda Bolton Weiser
And then when you launched the Montblanc Legend Spirit, I guess that was in second half last 2016. My expectation was that it was just a small flank of sort of thing, but it ended up being pretty significant as a driver. So, is the Montblanc Legend Night going to be on the scale of Spirit, or is it going to be like a more minor launch? And then what’s the timing of that launch?
Jean Madar
The Legend will be launching really new pillar for Legend with Legend Night. We have been also surprised by the success of Spirit. So, we expect also a nice growth in the Montblanc in 2017. Russ, do you want to add something?
Russell Greenberg
The only thing that I would correct, the Legend Spirit was actually launched in early 2016. So, we did have the product out for most of the year. And as Jean said, its success caught everybody by a little bit by surprise. It turned out to be a much more successful launch for a flanker than we expected.
Linda Bolton Weiser
And when does the Legend Night launch?
Jean Madar
Legend Night will be launched in certain markets in third quarter.
Russell Greenberg
It’s actually going to be towards the very end of the year in certain markets, and then continue its geographic expansion into 2018.
Linda Bolton Weiser
And then can I just say a few, in the Russian market, a lot of other small companies have been having difficulties getting on a more steady track of growth there, given the market disruption. Are you selling in Russia through distributors? And is the issue that the distributors are having problems financing inventory, or is it the end demand that has dried up in Russia, or is it both?
Jean Madar
No, we do not have too much an issue with our distributor, because it happens to be that our distributor owns the 950 stores in Russia, and they own, which represents 40% market share. The name of the chain is called [indiscernible]. So, the problem is not really the distributor, the problem is really the end consumers buying less, prices are more expensive in rubles. So we’ll have and that’s what we are doing for this year, we’ll have to heavily spend in advertising to regain some market share. And that’s what we will do with all our new launches for Russia this year.
Linda Bolton Weiser
And then finally, can I just ask you about the North American market. And Macy’s has had some store closures, and department store traffic has been harmed in some ways due to less tourist foot traffic. How is it that you’re succeeding so much and how is your distribution in the specialty, like Alta and Sephora. Are you fully distributed there as well as in the department stores?
Jean Madar

Our business in department stores is following the trend. It’s quite challenging; but of course, the business is at Alta and Sephora is growing at a very fast pace, especially with Alta more than Sephora. And we are lucky that the brands that we have are doing also well in department stores. For instance, we launched Coach at Macy, and it was very successful. So, I will say that we are -- even though the business in U.S. department store is not great, we have been okay this year. But we are looking at this very carefully. We do not want to be over-dependent of a department store. That’s why we will develop more programs for stores like Alta. Russ, you want to add?
Russell Greenberg
No. I think you hit it. The two main issues is that the department store business is losing traction to those specialty stores. We have our products hitting in both. But it really is the success of the brands and the successes of the launches that is driving the results that we’ve been reporting.
Operator
The next question is from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Joseph Altobello
First question, I guess, is more of a big picture one. What went wrong with Lagerfeld?
Jean Madar
What went wrong with Lagerfeld, I think we miss-positioned Lagerfeld. We wanted to recreate a product that was quite expensive geared for very key market where the brand today is we think more accessible. And that’s why the new products that we’ll be launching are 25% lower in prices, so it’s a more democratic, a little bit or so, more younger customer. So, we still think that we are going to find some growth in the business. We just need to reposition and the adjustment, the accounting adjustment that we have made is due to a test, and we call it, impairment test. But it’s not a reflection of what we think of Karl Lagerfeld. Like I said, these are brand that we’ll continue. But we definitely need to reposition it. And that’s what we are doing in order to find the growth for this year and next.
Joseph Altobello
And in terms of China, you guys talked about that market still being depressed. If you hear from other beauty companies, they talk about some fairly strong growth in China. So, I am just curious is this weakness unique to fragrances, because most of the other beauty companies that we speak to are more make up skincare.
Jean Madar
Absolutely. Make-up and skincare is doing much better. I see the orders coming back from China, I see the program. So, I think that we see the light at the end of the tunnel for China. But we are not going to see the growth that we’ve seen in the years, in two years or four years, before. And China becomes an expensive market, you need to advertise heavily. And our business will grow at, in 2017, at a modest rate. But we will see growth in China in 2017. Russ?
Russell Greenberg
No, I agree there. I think the most important point that you made is that, although we do see some very modest growth in China, going forward, it's nowhere near the levels of growth that we have seen in years pass.
Joseph Altobello
So the weakness is relegated to the fragrance category, it sounds like?
Jean Madar
Yes, and it is. And that’s why we have spent, in 2016, we have just I think has increased a lot. I think we spent close to $100 million in promotion and advertising in 2016, because we need to increase the market share in difficult countries like China, and like Russia.
Joseph Altobello
And just one last one for Russ, I guess if you look at your French subsidiary’s guidance, which they gave back in January and again reiterated today. They are looking for sales this year about €385 million to €390 million. And I guess if you back into a U.S. dollar number that implies some pretty massive growth for U.S. business. What’s going to drive that, call it, 20% growth in your domestic business?

Russell Greenberg
Well, I’m not sure exactly what rates you’re using…
Joseph Altobello
Dollar [indiscernible] to the euro…
Russell Greenberg
For the last two years, the average was somewhere right around 111. So, it’s very difficult to pinpoint. I don’t think it means massive increases for the U.S., but it certainly does mean reasonable or at least low double-digits or high single-digit growth for the U.S. side of the business. And most of that is coming from the newest lines that we have, which were launched last year; the Abercrombie and the Hollister lines, are what’s going to be driving this continued growth going into 2017. In addition, Dunhill should have a little bit of an easier comparison. But again, I’m not -- we’re not looking at massive growth here. My model doesn’t show massive growth, it shows in the high single digits.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Frank Camma with Sidoti. Please go ahead with your question.
Frank Camma
Can you talk a little bit about just for kind of follow-up for the last question, touched on a little bit about the promotion expense, I mean, absolute dollar and percentage going up. But last year, you have a number of new launches. I understand you have a number of this year. But is that same rate that we can expect going forward that level of support? I mean, do you -- because you, obviously, that affects what kind of leverage you get on your SG&A, so I just want to…
Jean Madar
Yes, Russ, you want to start...
Russell Greenberg
I think it’s a trend that has been going on for the last several years. We reached for our -- included in our SG&A was around 19% of our sales, was spent on promotion and advertising compared to 17.9%, just a little under 18% the prior year. As Jean mentioned just two minutes ago, with launching new product into countries like China or where the markets are relatively weak or even to support the brands in most of the major markets around the world, we really have to support it with promotion and advertising.
And even though we see in our numbers, 19%, there’s also a significant amount of dollars that are spent by our distributors in local markets, in connection with promotion and advertising. This is part of our business. This is the way we drive the business. It’s the way brands grow and gain the name recognition that we need in order to keep these trends moving along. So, 19% is very reasonable. I wouldn’t be shocked if it grew a little bit, and went to almost 20%. I think that’s the trend that we’re on, at least, over the last several years.
Frank Camma
And have you found digital marketing at all effective in this category or is it…
Jean Madar
Absolutely. I will say, last year, between what we spent and what our distributor spent, 25% of -- 20% at least of this budget was spent on digital. And to go back to what Russ said, we think it’s very important to support our brands in order to continue to grow the market. We could make more money if we were short-side. We could be more profitable by cutting a point or two of advertising, but it will be a very bad mistake.
We need to support all our brands. Coach is new, and we are overspending much more than our obligation our contractual obligation, on coach. We are overspending much more than our average of 20% on Oscar. We are also overspending on Jimmy Choo, and we want to continue like that. And let’s not forget that we have to fight against larger company, while on single source, lot of new products. So, in order to be competitive, we’ll continue the spending.
Frank Camma
My last question is just on your infrastructure as a whole, regardless of promotion. But just as far as adding new brands, I am assuming it’s still true that you wouldn’t have to really add much as far as incremental fixed cost if you were to bring on a new brand assuming. Is that correct?

Jean Madar
Absolutely, I mean, I don’t have numbers. But we could add $50 million or $100 million of business with new license without changing anything in our SG&A. Russ, you agree?
Russell Greenberg
Yes, certainly, without any significant changes. Absolutely.
Jean Madar
Significant changes, yes.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Vahid Khorsand with BWS. Please go ahead with your question.
Vahid Khorsand
Could you provide an update as far as Coach goes in Japan, and how much do you think at least the approach in Japan would have on sales?
Jean Madar
It’s a little bit early, but I can tell you that we are overall budgeted. And for Japan, we launched also in Singapore, which was quite good. We’ll continue -- 2017 is really the rollout of Coach that Coach, besides being a very strong American brand in America, is a very strong brand in Asia. So, Asia is a major, major market for Coach. So we are -- what I can tell you without disclosing the precise number is, Coach is over our target in all the countries that it has been notched. And we will continue with the men’s line in August or September. And we feel we will start shipping the men’s line in older markets. So, we’ll have even a stronger presence when we get to the Christmas season.
Vahid Khorsand
And then could you provide an update on Rochas and other markets you could be going into?
Jean Madar
We will be launching the new Rochas in 12 countries next month; definitely Spain and France, which are the two very important countries for Rochas; we’ll continue with the rest of Europe, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal; then we will launch in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Kuwait, and of course South America, Argentina, and Brazil. We’ll have a second wave towards July-August, with the rest of the countries. As you know, Rochas is not a license it’s a brand that we own. So of course we do not have to pay royalty. So we are spending. We are able to put more money into advertising. And I think that it will help the launch of a new fragrance.
Vahid Khorsand
And going back to the conversation on the big-box stores, I know you were talking about your presence in specialty stores. But have you done any internal research on how much of your sales come from the lower-tiered malls? And if you have any plans into combating that, and when they eventually do shut down. I mean, where do you see the future of your sales coming from?
Russell Greenberg
Well, I mean today, the sales that you see in any big-box stores is really coming through diversion, for the most part. Other than if there are lines that are being closed out, or discontinued, you might find them. But otherwise, it comes through diversion. And we take it very seriously. This is a problem that has been in our industry, as you know, for many, many years. There are new techniques that we’re looking into with respect to inventory tracking.
And where it makes sense to do that, from a monetary standpoint to protect some of our brands, we’re going to do what we need to do to protect the brands. But our business is not geared for big-box stores or Walmart-type stores. So, I would say, 95% or 98% of that is coming through diversion.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
Russell Greenberg
That’s great. Thank you, Operator. One last point before we say goodbye, I just want to mention that I will be presenting at the B. Riley Investor Conference, which runs from May 24th to May 25th in Santa Monica, California; two other conferences that are in New York, in June. I will be at the Citi Small and Mid-Cap Conference, which runs from June 8th to June 9th, as well as the Piper Jaffray Consumer Conference, which runs from June 13th to June 14th.

We should have more precise dates when we announce our first quarter results in early May. And I hope to see some of you at these events. Once again, thank you for your participation on this call, whether you are live or listening via webcast. And as always, if anyone has additional questions, I am available to take your calls. Thank you, and have a great day.
Operator

Art of Packaging Award Gala honors Jean Madar of Inter Parfums

By Deanna UtroskeDeanna Utroske 28-Jun-20162016-06-28T00:00:00ZLast updated on 28-Jun-2016 at 17:03 GMT2016-06-28T17:03:35Z

Last week at New York City’s University Club, hundreds of fragrance and beauty industry leaders, student honorees, and allies gathered for the annual fund-raising celebration put on by the Pratt Institute. 
 


 
The funds in question (an estimated $350,000) go to Pratt’s Mark Rosen Scholarship and Education Fund for Packaging by Design. Rosen himself studied and now teaches at the New York City college, which is home to the world’s only graduate degree program in cosmetic and fragrance packaging design.Celebratory galaThe fashionable event celebrated Jean Madar, CEO and chairman of the board at Inter Parfums. After being introduced by Gilbert Harrison, founder and chairman of the M&A advisory services group Financo, Madar spoke at length about the nuanced business of fragrance packaging design. “Packaging design,” he says, “is at the crossroads of art and commerce.”It is the work of true artisans and often takes more time than blending the fragrance itself, says Madar. “Bottles,” he believes, “know how to tell stories.” And, it’s important for designers to recognize that brand DNA is never a formula but, rather, that’s it is more like alchemy, manipulating a vocabulary of colors, shapes, and more.Designing the futureSix students were also recognized for their fragrance packaging design achievements at this year’s event: Paula Ip, Talia Douaidy, Xinlu Liu, Fang Yi Chu, Brielle Wilson, and Eugene Kim. Each created a complete fragrance packaging prototype, comprising a bottle, scent card, shopping bag, and advertisement.  


As the evening neared its conclusion, Damini Singh was awarded the Rosen Scholarship. And starting this fall, she will begin courses to earn her Masters in Communications Design from Pratt.In conversation with Simran Pabla of theknockturnal.com, Singh explained her background, “I’m an architect. I did my masters from the UK. After that I worked three years as an architect. I realized that architecture isn’t creatively fulfilling; It’s something I can do but on a smaller level. So I looked at all my options and the University that stood out to me the most was Pratt. After that I taught myself the basics of graphic design and created my portfolio.”

Prior to such time, for approximately 30 years, he worked at various executive positions at Unilever, including President and CEO of Elida Fabergé France and President and CEO of Chesebrough Pond’s USA. We believe that Mr. Choël, who has previously worked as President and Chief Executive Officer of two divisions of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which included such well-known brands as Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, and Parfums Givenchy, is qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.

As the result of his business and financial acumen, as well as his experience as managing partner of a business consulting firm in the area of mergers and acquisitions of large international companies in retail, consumer goods and consumer services throughout the world, we believe Mr. Heilbronn is qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.

He is a member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and the Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee, worked for twenty-seven years at L'Oreal, and was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Cosmair, the exclusive United States licensee of L'Oreal, from 1983 through June 1987.
