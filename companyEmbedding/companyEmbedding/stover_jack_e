NEWTOWN, Pa., May  23, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONTX), a Phase 3 clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel products to treat cancer, today announced that Jack E. Stover has been appointed to its Board of Directors.  Currently, Mr. Stover serves as Interim President, CEO and Director of Interpace Diagnostics Group Inc., a company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating the risks of thyroid and pancreatic cancer.  Prior to his tenure at Interpace Diagnostics Group he served from August 2005 until December 2015 as Director, Member of the Special Executive Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee of PDI Inc.

In addition to his current position at Interpace Diagnostics Inc., Mr. Stover has served as President of Zebec Therapeutics, the successor to Quandrant Pharma, a position he has held since September 2012.  Zebec is a privately held, virtual pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and repositioning branded and generic products with predictable cash flows and managing product life cycles. Mr. Stover formerly served as Executive Chairman of Targeted Nano Therapeutics from November 2008 to August 2012. He also served as Chief Executive Officer and Director of Antares Pharma Inc., a publicly traded specialty pharmaceutical company, from June 2004 to November 2008.  Mr. Stover joined Antares as President and COO.  He led the transition from a platform based device company to a product based company.  Mr. Stover joined Antares Pharma from SICOR Inc., which was subsequently sold to Teva Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion.  At SICOR, Inc., he served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Operating Officer and Treasurer.  For over 15 years prior, Mr. Stover was an employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers (previously Coopers & Lybrand), serving as a partner for over five years. He is a certified public accountant and received his Bachelor’s Degree in Accounting and Finance from Lehigh University. “We are happy to welcome Jack Stover to our Board of Directors,” stated Ramesh Kumar, Ph.D., President and CEO of Onconova.  “His extensive experience in the life sciences industry will greatly benefit both the Onconova management team and the other members of the Board of Directors. As the Chair of our Audit Committee, I have no doubt Jack will bring strong counsel and strategic vision to the Company as we advance our Phase 3 stage product candidate, rigosertib, towards approval for the unmet medical needs of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).” About Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. Onconova Therapeutics is a Phase 3 clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel products to treat cancer. Onconova's clinical and pre-clinical stage drug development candidates are derived from its extensive chemical library and are designed to work against specific cellular pathways that are important in cancer cells, while causing minimal damage to normal cells.

 LOS ANGELES -- Arbios Systems, Inc. (OTC BB: ABOS), a biomedical device company engaged in the development of proprietary liver assist technologies useful in the treatment of acute liver failure, is pleased to announce that Jack E. Stover was appointed a Director of the Company on November 2, 2004.  Mr. Stover is currently the President, CEO and Director of Antares Pharma Inc. (AMEX: AIS), an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company whose products and technologies include transdermal gels, fast-melt oral tablets and mini-needle and needle-free injector systems.  Prior to joining Antares, Mr. Stover was the Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer of SICOR, Inc., the largest publicly-held vertically integrated specialty, injectable pharmaceutical company that was recently sold to Teva Pharmaceuticals for in excess of $3.4 billion. Prior to Sicor Mr. Stover was Executive Vice President and Director of Gynetics, Inc. a privately held women's health care company developing and marketing proprietary drugs and devices.  Mr. Stover also served as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer and Director for B. Braun Medical, an international medical products and pharma company where he led the Company's first private placement and its largest acquisition, a pharmaceutical division of Ivax Corp for in excess of $250 million.  For over 16 years Mr. Stover was an employee and then a partner with Pricewaterhouse Coopers (formerly Coopers & Lybrand) where he was Partner- in- Charge of the LifeSciences Practice in New Jersey.  Mr. Stover earned a Bachelors degree in Business in 1975 from Lehigh University and is a certified public accountant.  Commenting on the appointment Dr. Jacek Rozga, President of Arbios Systems, stated, "We are delighted to have Jack on the Arbios board. I believe Jack's vast knowledge and skills, especially within the healthcare industry, will be highly beneficial to Arbios as we progress toward commercialization of the products we are currently developing."  About Arbios  Arbios Systems, Inc. is a biomedical device company that, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Arbios Technologies, Inc., is engaged in the discovery, acquisition and development of proprietary liver assist devices and new technologies useful in the diagnosis and treatment of acute liver failure. Arbios' products in development include SEPET(TM), a novel blood purification therapy employing selective plasma filtration therapy, HepatAssist-2(TM), a bioartificial liver based on technology recently acquired from Circe Biomedical, Inc., and LIVERAID(TM), a bioartificial liver in which liver cell therapy and sorbent-based hemodiafiltration are integrated in the company's proprietary three-compartment cartridge with fiber-in-fiber geometry.  At present no effective direct treatment for liver failure is available, and patients must receive a liver transplant or endure prolonged hospitalization with a significant mortality rate. However, only a small percentage of liver failure patients receive a transplant due to shortage of donor livers. Further, many patients cannot be transplanted because of alcohol or drug abuse, infection, cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc. There is, therefore, an urgent need for artificial means of liver assistance to facilitate recovery from liver failure without a transplant.  Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Further discussion of these and other potential risk factors may be found in Arbios' latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-KSB, and any subsequent updates thereto on form 10-QSB. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof. Arbios disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

Antares Pharma, Inc. (ANTR) Appoints Jack E. Stover As Chief Executive Officer (CEO), President And Director











Tweet








10/19/2005 5:08:46 PM



EXTON, Pa., Aug. 17  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Antares Pharma, Inc.  (BULLETIN BOARD: ANTR) , an evolving specialty pharmaceutical company with headquarters in Exton, Pennsylvania, today announced the appointment of former President and COO Jack E. Stover to the additional roles of Chief Executive Officer and Director.  Concurrently, Roger G. Harrison, Ph.D., has resigned effective September 1, 2004, as both Chief Executive Officer and Director to spend more time on personal and other business interests; however, he will remain as a consultant to the Company.
Prior to joining Antares Pharma, Mr. Stover was Executive Vice President and CFO of Sicor, Inc., a public injectable pharmaceuticals company that was sold to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for approximately $3.4 billion. Prior to his time at Sicor, Mr. Stover held various senior management and operating roles with both proprietary pharmaceutical and global medical device companies and earlier was a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers (formerly Coopers & Lybrand), where he headed their life sciences industry practice in New Jersey.
Commenting on his new responsibilities, Mr. Stover said, "I am excited about the opportunity to utilize my skills in the generics, branded and medical device industries in leading Antares Pharma as it transitions to a market-oriented specialty pharmaceutical company.  I believe the depth of Antares Pharma's technology and its commercial development to date, as well as the partnering relationships established under the leadership of Dr. Harrison, position the Company to uniquely take advantage of expanding market opportunities and become a leader in this sector."
Dr. Jacques Gonella, Chairman of Antares Pharma, said, "We are grateful for the outstanding effort and personal commitment that Dr. Harrison has made to the Company and wish him well in his future endeavors.  We are very confident that Mr. Stover's prior experience will provide the guidance and leadership the Company needs as it continues its rapid evolution as a specialty pharma business."
About Antares Pharma
Antares Pharma is an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company leveraging its experience in drug delivery systems to enhance product performance of established and developing drugs.  The Company's current technology platforms include transdermal (Advanced Transdermal Delivery ATD(TM)) gels, disposable mini-needle injection systems (Vibex(TM)), reusable needle-free injection systems (VISION(R) and Valeo(TM)), and fast-melt oral (Easy Tec(TM)) tablets. The Company currently has active partnering programs with several pharmaceutical and distribution companies for a number of indications and applications, including diabetes, growth disorders, obesity, female sexual dysfunction and other hormone therapy.
Antares Pharma currently distributes its needle-free injector systems in more than 20 countries and markets the same technology for use with human growth hormone through licensees in most major regions of the world. Licensees also market an ibuprofen gel using Antares Pharma's ATD(TM) technology in several major European countries.  In addition, Antares Pharma is undertaking development or is conducting research on several product opportunities that will form the basis of its specialty pharma program. Antares Pharma's corporate headquarters is in Exton, Pennsylvania, with subsidiaries performing research, development, manufacturing and product commercialization activities in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Basel, Switzerland.
