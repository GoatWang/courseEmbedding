Great Sound in a Small Package
The Mackie ProFX16v2 16-channel professional effects USB mixer means you can stop sacrificing sound quality for affordability. At Sweetwater we believe every gig you play can sound great, and the ProFX16v2 boasts that great sound along with the tools you need to create an amazing-sounding mix. You get ten of Mackie's new Vita preamps for your mic, guitar, keyboard, or anything else you need to do your show. After you've plugged in, tap into the powerful ReadyFX effects engine to add finesse to your mix. Show your audience you care by giving them the best sound you can with the Mackie ProFX16v2 professional effects USB mixer.


Mackie ProFX16v2 Professional Effects USB Mixer at a Glance:
All the tools you need for great sound
Gear that stands the test of time
Record and stream via USB
All the tools you need for great sound
Like the name says, the ProFX16v2 is a professional mixer, with convenient features and sound that rivals that of some larger format mixers. Mackie designed the Vita preamps with live sound in mind to provide the quality of sound that is lacking in some compact mixers. Each channel features its own individual 3-band EQ with sweepable mid-frequencies and 100Hz low-cut filter for shaping the sound of your inputs. The ReadyFX digital effects engine gives you access to 16 different effects including reverbs and delays - Mackie even added chorus effects for your guitar. A 7-band graphic EQ can be assigned either to your main outputs so you can fine tune the PA or the aux output to easily get rid of feedback in your monitors. If you perform with tracks there are inputs (including USB) for your laptop or MP3 player. You get four channels of single-knob compression, a headphone output with individual level control, and when you add to all that phantom power for your condenser mics, you have no reason NOT to own a ProFX16v2.
Gear that stands the test of time
Ever walk into a venue to set up and been pointed to an old Mackie mixer in the corner, covered in years of smoke, dust, and bar goo? Are you surprised when you plug in, fire it up, and rock your gig? You shouldn't be! Mackie has been making solid, roadworthy gear for decades and the ProFX16v2 is no different. In fact, the gear just keeps getting better. Built like a tank? Indeed! With solid steel chassis construction and super-tough ABS side protection you'll be playing through your ProFX16v2 for years to come. 
Record and stream via USB
With all the right tools for the job, the ProFX16v2 allows you to create memorable mixes, but even with all those features, portability is paramount and you can't be burdened with lugging around additional equipment. No worries, integrated USB I/O takes the pain out of recording. Just connect the ProFX16v2 to a laptop, start up your included copy of Tracktion music production software (or almost any DAW software) and you can record the whole mix. You can even stream music from your laptop during breaks.
The innovative "USB Thru" switch allows for an impressive live/recording setup when using performance software like Ableton Live or Reason. When gigging, stream the output of your performance software (or iTunes, for that matter) into the ProFX16v2. Combine that signal with anything plugged into the mixer, and send the whole thing back to the computer for recording. Archiving your integrated live performances has never been easier!
Mackie ProFX16v2 Professional Effects USB Mixer Features:
10 low-noise Mackie Vita mic preamps add life to any input
ReadyFX effects engine with 16 effects including reverbs, delays, and choruses
7-band graphic EQ for tuning mains or monitors
Aux output for monitor mixes, venue 70-volt systems, and more
3-band EQ with sweepable mids and 100Hz low-cut filter on all channels
48-volt phantom power on all mic channels
Headphone output with separate level control for easy monitoring
Roadworthy design with steel chassis and ABS side protection
Balanced XLR and balanced/unbalanced 1/4-inch main outputs
FX mute with remote control via footswitch
Break switch mutes all channels for music playback between sets
USB for playback music and recording via Mac or PC
Includes user-friendly Tracktion recording software
4 flexible subgroups for professional mix management
2 aux outputs for monitor mixes, fill speakers and more
Individual channel mutes and overload indication
4 channels of single-knob compression for smooth, even dynamic control
Get the channel count you need and the sound quality you want with Mackie's ProFX16v2 mixer!

5/5

Jackie - Wow!


		Can't say much other than nothing sounded as good as our small jam group playing instruments and singing through this system, Crystal clear, with great range!	

 




5/5

Wow.


		I also have the ProFX12, and this is a nice upgrade from that!The 10 XLR channels are so great for mic'ing a whole band, or just part...The mic channels all have a pre-amp and four channels of compression allows so much control. The two separate monitor sends are extremely useful, especially in a full band situation, and the Effects are subtle, but great! Very happy so far... have used it for about 8 gigs and it has been awesome!	

 




4.5/5

Awesome Mixer/Wicked Price


		The absolute best mixer.  Easy to use & even easier to set up.  Strongly recommend to any band needing an affordable compact mixer!	

 




3.5/5

Solid Board, but the effects are terrible


		Mackie makes pretty durable equipment and it is good enough for live sound. I got my board a few days ago and started playing with it. I have to say that the built-in effects are terrible. There is no way to use any of these. I am seriously thinking about returning it.  But I'm not sure which board to choose, SoundCraft, Allen & Heath, Behringer or Yamaha. They all have built-in effects	

 




2/5

Not your father's Mackie


		Different electrical ghost every gig with this thing. Channels work one week and not the next. The mains have gone out twice, only to mysteriously work after the gig. My old CFX Mark11 series is a tank.

The Mackie Story
Founded by Greg Mackie in 1988 in Woodinville, Washington, Mackie was one of the first companies to build a quality mixing console that home recording musicians could afford. The company's first offering, the LM-1602 16-channel mixer, was enormously popular. Its revolutionary follow-up, the CR-1604, arrived in 1991 and cemented the company's reputation for rugged, affordable mixers with excellent sound. After Mackie released the CR-1604, the number of home studios grew exponentially. Corporate video departments, houses of worship, and schools were also eager to get their hands on a CR-1604.
Expanding Beyond Mixers
By the mid '90s, Mackie was flourishing. Greg continued to focus on building quality, affordable, easy-to-use mixers. He also continually reinvested profits into production, ensuring that Mackie churned out nothing but top-notch products. In 1996, Mackie charted a new course by releasing its first non-mixer products: the M-1200 power amplifier and 8200 studio monitors. The company also, while not abandoning its affordable roots, built the SR40-8 large-format mixing console. Due to the success of these new products, Mackie began investing heavily in research and development.
Continued Success
Today, Mackie continues to build innovative, high quality gear at affordable prices. Their Mackie Control is a widely used DAW tactile control surface. Their lightweight, yet powerful Thump series active PA speakers can be found on live stages everywhere. Mackie's VLZ series demonstrates that they still build practical, affordable mixers with preamp technology that's renowned for its price to performance ratio. Their DL series mixers even provide you with wireless iPad control that allows you to mix from anywhere! If you're looking for great gear at a great price, you can't go wrong with Mackie.

From 1972 through December 2002, Mr. Mackie was an employee of and, effective in 1983, a partner with Arthur Andersen LLP, where he specialized in software and high technology industry clients. After leaving Arthur Andersen, Mr. Mackie served as a consultant to a number of organizations. Mr. Mackie received a Master's degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor's degree from Babson College, and is a certified public accountant. Mr. Mackie is currently a Trustee and former member of the Board of Directors, Compensation Committee and Chairman of the Audit Committee for the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. We believe that Mr. Mackie's training as a certified public accountant, his background as a partner of a registered independent public accounting firm and as a senior financial executive and his experience as a director of another public company qualify him to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.

The Mackie Story
Founded by Greg Mackie in 1988 in Woodinville, Washington, Mackie was one of the first companies to build a quality mixing console that home recording musicians could afford. The company's first offering, the LM-1602 16-channel mixer, was enormously popular. Its revolutionary follow-up, the CR-1604, arrived in 1991 and cemented the company's reputation for rugged, affordable mixers with excellent sound. After Mackie released the CR-1604, the number of home studios grew exponentially. Corporate video departments, houses of worship, and schools were also eager to get their hands on a CR-1604.
Expanding Beyond Mixers
By the mid '90s, Mackie was flourishing. Greg continued to focus on building quality, affordable, easy-to-use mixers. He also continually reinvested profits into production, ensuring that Mackie churned out nothing but top-notch products. In 1996, Mackie charted a new course by releasing its first non-mixer products: the M-1200 power amplifier and 8200 studio monitors. The company also, while not abandoning its affordable roots, built the SR40-8 large-format mixing console. Due to the success of these new products, Mackie began investing heavily in research and development.
Continued Success
Today, Mackie continues to build innovative, high quality gear at affordable prices. Their Mackie Control is a widely used DAW tactile control surface. Their lightweight, yet powerful Thump series active PA speakers can be found on live stages everywhere. Mackie's VLZ series demonstrates that they still build practical, affordable mixers with preamp technology that's renowned for its price to performance ratio. Their DL series mixers even provide you with wireless iPad control that allows you to mix from anywhere! If you're looking for great gear at a great price, you can't go wrong with Mackie.

Choosing the right speakers for the job is essential for getting the best sound quality. Follow these tips to select the right home audio speakers for your listening needs.Compare Speaker TypesFloor Speakers: When it comes to filling a big room with sound, floor speakers can't be beat. They're the largest type of speakers and stand on their own. With a pair of left and right speakers, you can immerse yourself in a realistic sound experience while watching movies.Bookshelf Speakers: In small- and medium-sized rooms, bookshelf speakers take up less space and are often small enough to fit inside a cabinet or on a shelf. Elevating the height rather than placing these speakers on the floor helps to aim the sound right at your ears. Use them on their own or as part of a surround sound system.Center Channel Speakers: Center channel speakers often sit horizontally and operate on mid-range frequencies to deliver clear dialog from movies and TV shows over sound effects and background music. Center channel speakers provide the best performance when you pair them with other speakers in your home audio system.Powered computer speakers: If your computer or laptop is the primary source for watching movies, playing video games or listening to music, then powered computer speakers are a smart choice. These space-saving speakers plug directly into your computer to amplify the sound and improve its quality.Evaluate Speaker DriversTweeters: High-frequency drivers that deliver sounds in the frequency spectrum of 2,000Hz to 20,000 Hz. Midrange: These drivers produce sounds in the range that falls between tweeters and woofers, usually between 500Hz and 2,000Hz. Woofers: Woofers produce sounds in a variety of frequencies. In three-way systems, woofers produce sounds at frequencies below the midrange drivers. In two-way systems, woofers produce sounds at frequencies below the tweeters. Subwoofers: These drivers produce sounds on the lowest frequencies, or bass, which are typically between 20Hz and 125Hz. Full Range: These drivers operate on the largest frequency range, eliminating the need to pair them with other types of drivers to produce the full range of sound.Define Speaker SpecificationsIf you're new to buying speakers, then you might not be familiar with some of the terms used to describe the speaker specifications. Once you determine what type of speakers you need, compare these specs to make a decision.Frequency response — refers to the frequency range that the speaker can produce. Frequency response is measured in Hertz (Hz). Human ears can detect sounds between 20Hz and 20,000Hz, and ideal speaker systems cover this range. Impedance refers to the amount of electrical resistance that an amplifier will encounter when sending audio signals to the speaker. Impedance is measured in Ohms. Your speakers' impedance should match the impedance of your home audio equipment. Sensitivity refers to how loud a speaker can get per watt of power. Sensitivity is measured in decibels per watt. The higher the sensitivity, the less amount of power the speaker needs to achieve high volumes. Power handling refers to the maximum sound signal that a speaker can handle without causing sound distortion or damage to the speaker. Power handling is measured in watts. Speakers should be able to handle the maximum output power of your audio receiver for best results.Consider Speaker Placement and AcousticsThe placement of the speakers, size of the room, type of flooring and furniture or other objects in the room can affect the acoustics. Hard surfaces, such as wood paneling, hardwood floors and windows, tend to reverberate sound, which creates audio distortion. In contrast, soft surfaces, such as carpeting, rugs and drapes, absorb the sound. Other irregularly shaped surfaces diffuse the sound or cast it in various directions rather than focusing it right on you. Carefully consider the placement of speakers and other furniture in the room to create the best sound.Choose Speakers for Your Home Audio SystemWhen shopping for speakers, consider the type of audio that you'll be listening to primarily. If you're an audiophile who loves to listen to your music collection, the focus on left and right stereo speakers. If you're setting up a home theater system to enjoy family movie night, then you want to set up surround sound. Connect several speakers to an audio receiver for a completely immersive sound experience.Don't Forget the Speaker CablesTo connect your speakers to your home audio system, you need speaker cables and wires. Be sure to choose high-quality cables for speakers positioned far away from the receiver. The longer the cable, the more the sound quality degrades. Many speakers use spring-clip terminals, which connect to bare speaker wire. High-end speakers often have binding post terminals, which have threaded jacks that create a secure connection for better sound quality. Make sure the type of cables and wires you choose are compatible with your speakers and receiver.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863887, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
