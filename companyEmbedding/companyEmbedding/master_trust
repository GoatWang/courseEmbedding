Master trusts & wraps
Wrapping up your investments
Master trusts and wraps allow you to 'wrap' your investments
into one package or portfolio of investments. They are generally
recommended by financial advisers. There are important differences
between the two. We explain how each of these structures work,
their benefits and things you should know before going down this
path.

What is a master trust?
What is a wrap?
Pros and cons of master trusts and
wraps

What is a master trust?
A master trust is an investment structure that allows an
investor to hold a portfolio of managed funds under the one umbrella. It
provides centralised reporting and is often used by financial
advisers as an easy way to manage their client's portfolio.
Master trusts typically have the following features:

Investments are held by a trustee in its name, on
behalf of the investor
The value of an investor's account is determined by the trustee
based on the value of the underlying investments
All fees and some taxes are bundled into the unit price for each
investment and allocated  to the investor
Income from the underlying assets is paid to the master trust
and then distributed to members
Franking credits are incorporated into
the unit price of the underlying investment
The underlying wholesale funds are usually specific to that
master trust which means they are not portable. If you want to
change to a different master trust you will need to sell your
current investment and buy a new one, which may result in a capital gain, which will be taxed at your
marginal tax rate.

What is a wrap?
A wrap is similar to a master trust but it allows an investor to
hold investments, such as managed funds and direct shares, under
the one umbrella. It is also used by financial advisers to provide
centralised reporting and flexibility which may allow the investor
to save costs.
Wraps typically have the following features:

They are operated by a trustee but the investor has
a beneficial ownership of the underlying assets
The value of a member's investment is determined by the
underlying assets
A wrap service uses a cash account for each member that income
and expenses are passed through
All fees and taxes are unbundled from the unit price and
disclosed separately
Any income from the underlying investments is paid into a
member's cash account
Franking credits are distributed to individual investors
through the cash account
Members' assets are portable, making it easy for an investor to
change wrap services

Pros and cons of master
trusts and wraps
Although master trusts and wraps have different structures, most
of these pros and cons are common to both.
Pros 

Access to wholesale funds - You can access a
wide range of wholesale funds that you may not be able to access
individually.
Cost - Having all your investments under the
one umbrella may reduce your investment costs and financial advice
costs as the administration service makes buying, selling, and
reporting much simpler.
Online access - You can usually check
your investments online at any time. A master trust or wrap may
offer you statements every 3, 6 or 12 months but make sure you are
not paying for more frequent statements than you need.
Portability - With a wrap service you own the
underlying investments which gives you the flexibility to move them
into or out of a wrap service.


Smart tip
Watch out for up-front fees when moving an existing investment
to a wrap or master trust. Ask your adviser if any fees can be
reduced or rebated to you.

Cons

Suitability - If you are only invested in one
or two diversified multi-manager funds, for example growth funds, you may be incurring
additional costs for an administration structure you don't
need.
Cost - Fees may include administration fees,
fees for moving money in and out, management fees for investment
options and service fees from your financial
adviser. Fees reduce the money you can invest and will impact
the value of your investment over time so make sure you are only
paying for services and features you need.
Lack of portability - A master trust
usually consists of investments in managed funds that are specific
to that master trust, which means that if you want to change
advisers you may have to sell your investment, which could result
in a capital gain. Ask your adviser how many advice firms use this
brand of master trust. A 'unique' offering may be a
disadvantage.

Master trusts and wraps are good for those who
have a large sum of money to invest and want the convenience of one
report for multiple investments. A wrap or master trust may be a
convenient way to reduce costs and simplify reporting but make sure
it is for your benefit and not just convenient for your
adviser.

Meeting with a financial adviser
Starting with a financial adviser
You've chosen an adviser. Now it's time to make an appointment
and begin the process of getting advice.
This page gives you some tips on what to do before your first
meeting and how to judge whether the adviser is the best choice for
you.

Preparing for your first meeting with a
financial adviser
What to expect at your first meeting
Judging your financial adviser
How you'll receive the financial
advice

Preparing for your first
meeting with a financial adviser
Before you meet the adviser for the first time, do some
preparation. Good advice depends on a clear picture of your
financial situation.
For example, you could start by listing:

What you own - your home, savings, super, car, shares and other
investments
What you owe - debts including mortgages, loans and outstanding
credit card balances
Income and expenses
What insurance you have and for how much
Whether you have an up-to-date will

Copies of your pay slip, savings account and super statements
will also help the adviser get a snap shot of your finances.
Use the budget planner to get an overview of
your financial situation.
Our financial advice toolkit helps you navigate the steps
involved in the financial advice process. You can use this tool to
create a summary of your financial situation which you can take to
your first meeting with a financial adviser.
Understand the the financial advice process.
Financial advice toolkit
Think about your goals
It's also helpful to do some advance thinking about your
priorities and goals so you can go to the first meeting with a
'brief' for the adviser.
For example do you want to:

Pay off your mortgage sooner?
Build wealth and save for retirement?
Save for your children's education?
Make the most of an inheritance?

Also think about the type of advice you'd like. Are you
expecting the adviser to prepare a broad financial plan or do you
want advice on a particular area of your finances?
See types of financial advice for
more information about your advice options.


Case study: Sam and Diane get ready
'We wanted to get our
relationship with the adviser off to a constructive start. We spent
several evenings preparing before our first meeting. We arrived for
the meeting with a rough budget and paperwork on our investments,
insurance and loans. Most importantly, we had discussed what we
wanted to achieve in the 3 years before we retired and then, in the
years after finishing work. Our adviser was pretty impressed and it
helped to focus the whole process.


What to expect at your first
meeting
Make sure you give your adviser accurate information at the
first meeting. If you are not honest with your adviser or if you
leave something out, you could get advice that's wrong for your
situation. Tell the adviser if you can only give limited or
incomplete information.
You also need to be clear about which issues will be covered and
which ones won't be. Once you've established the scope of the
advice, the adviser will be able to give you an idea of the cost.
See financial advice costs, for more
information.
Discuss risk
A good adviser will work with you to help identify the most
suitable strategy to achieve your financial goals.
Part of this strategy should be to protect your capital and get
reasonable returns from your investments, without exposing you to
too much risk. Higher potential returns usually come with higher
risks. Never agree to an investment product or strategy that you're
not comfortable with or don't understand.
Your attitude to risk can change with time and circumstances. If
you've agreed to ongoing advice, you need to tell your adviser if
your ability or willingness to take on more or less investment risk
changes.
For more information see risk and return.
Learn more about the principles of investing from our Investing
between the flags booklet.
Judging your financial
adviser
It's easy to be swayed by an adviser's confidence,
approachability and friendliness. Don't let this affect how you
judge the first meeting. Here are some things to consider before
you go any further with the relationship.



Generally, the meeting will have gone well if:
You should reconsider your choice of adviser if:



The adviser:

Asks you about your circumstances and helps you identify your
goals


Has explained the scope of the advice they can provide based on
the amount you're willing to pay


Is happy to explain complicated financial concepts until you
understand them


The adviser:

Pressures you to sign documents that you haven't read or don't
understand


Doesn't ask about or listen to what you want


Seems to be pushing one solution, regardless of your needs
(such as a self-managed super fund or borrowing to invest)





You:

Are confident that the adviser understands your situation,
needs and goals


Are clear about the service you're receiving, what the advice
will and won't cover, and how much it will cost


You:

Don't understand why a particular strategy is appropriate for
you


Don't feel comfortable asking for explanations or feel
intimidated by your adviser





How you'll receive the
financial advice
After your first meeting, your adviser will do some further
research and put together some recommendations. You will receive
the recommendations in writing, usually at a face-to-face meeting,
where the adviser will explain the recommendations and discuss the
reasons for choosing one path or product over another.
See what to look for in
financial advice for more information about judging whether the
advice is suitable for you.
Think about your financial goals and priorities
before you meet with a financial adviser for the first time. This
will help the adviser come up with a financial plan tailored to
your needs and tolerance for risk.
