					Full Description



Zafgen, Inc., incorporated on November 22, 2005, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on improving the health and well-being of patients affected by obesity and complex metabolic disorders. The Company's lead product candidate, Beloranib, is a twice-weekly subcutaneous injection being developed for the treatment of multiple indications, including severe obesity in rare diseases, such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and hypothalamic injury-associated obesity (HIAO), including craniopharyngioma-associated obesity. Beloranib is in Phase III stage of development for PWS. It is also developing ZGN-839, a liver-targeted methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibitor, for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and abdominal obesity, as well as other second-generation MetAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of severe obesity.Beloranib is an injectable small molecule therapy with a mechanism of action that reduces hunger while stimulating the use of stored fat as an energy source. Beloranib is an anti-obesity agent that addresses over two abnormalities that are present in the obese patient, including hunger that is inappropriate relative to the amount of energy stored as fat, and dysregulation of fat metabolism, which causes more fat to be made and stored in an obese patient than in a lean person. Beloranib acts through the inhibition of MetAP2, an enzyme that modulates the activity of various cellular processes that control metabolism. MetAP2 inhibitors work, at least in part, by directing MetAP2 binding to cellular stress mediators, thereby reducing the tone of signals that drive lipid synthesis by the liver and fat storage throughout the body. In this manner, MetAP2 inhibition serves the purpose of re-establishing balance to the ways the body packages and metabolizes fat and glucose. MetAP2 inhibitors reduce the production of new fatty acid molecules by the liver and help convert stored fats into useful energy, while reducing hunger. The product has completed the Phase IIb clinical trials.The Company's other product candidate, ZGN-839, is in pre-clinical development stages. The Company is also evaluating additional MetAP2 inhibitors beyond Beloranib as development candidates for the treatment of severe obesity in the general population. MetAP2 inhibitors may also have utility in the treatment of other metabolic diseases, such as NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).The Company competes with Neurosearch A/S, Roche Group, GlaxoSmithKline, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vivus, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S and Allergan, Inc.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
