The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

The Partnership intends to trade only energy and energy-related products, but is authorized to trade commodity futures, swaps and option contracts of any kind. The Partnership had invested substantially all of its capital in the Master prior to its full redemption from the Master effective December 31, 2014. AAA was authorized to trade forward contracts on behalf of the Partnership but did not do so (certain swaps that the Advisor traded were, however, the substantial economic equivalent of forward contracts.)  The General Partner manages all business of the Partnership. The General Partner has delegated its responsibility for the investment of the Partnership's assets to the Advisor. The General Partner engages a team of approximately 30 professionals whose primary emphasis is on attempting to maintain quality control among the advisors to the funds operated or managed by the General Partner. A full-time staff of due diligence professionals uses proprietary technology and on-site evaluations to monitor new and existing futures money managers. The accounting and operations staff provides processing of subscriptions and redemptions and reporting to limited partners and regulatory authorities. The General Partner also includes staff involved in marketing and sales support. In selecting the Advisor for the Partnership, as applicable, the General Partner considered past performance, trading style, volatility of markets traded and fee requirements. The General Partner may modify or terminate the allocation of assets to the Advisor at any time.  Responsibilities of the General Partner/Managing Member include or included, as applicable,:   due diligence examinations of the Advisor;   selection, appointment and termination of the Advisor;   negotiation of the Management Agreement; and   monitoring the activity of the Advisor.  In addition, the General Partner provides, or will assist SS&C in providing, and the Managing Member provided, the administrative and compliance services that are required by law or regulation from time to time in connection with operation of the Partnership/Master.  While the Partnership has the right to seek lower commission rates and fees from other commodity brokers at any time, the General Partner believes that the customer agreements and other arrangements with the commodity broker are fair, reasonable and competitive.  Pan Capital Management, LP  Effective February 1, 2015, Pan commenced trading the Partnership's assets directly pursuant to its Energy Trading Program, a proprietary, discretionary trading program. Pan will concentrate the Partnership's trading in energy-related markets. Risk management is an integrated part of Pan's goal of identifying favorable risk/reward trading opportunities for its Energy Trading Program. Pan will monitor risks of all positions and will attempt to prevent over-concentration of particular investment asset or strategy.  AAA Capital Management Advisors, Ltd.  From inception to December 31, 2014, the Partnership's and the Master's sole trading advisor was AAA. The Partnership's assets allocated to AAA for trading were not invested in commodity interests directly, prior to its full redemption effective December 31, 2014. AAA's allocation of the Partnership's assets was invested in the Master. AAA traded the Master's, and thereby the Partnership's, assets in accordance with its Energy Program - Futures and Swaps.  The Master traded energy futures contracts and options on energy futures contracts on domestic and international exchanges, as well as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (an index future comprised of energy and other products) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Master also engaged in swap transactions involving crude oil and other energy-related products. References herein to energy and energy-related products include all of the foregoing.  AAA generally based its trading decisions on "fundamental" factors, namely supply and demand for a particular group or type of commodity. AAA attempted to buy undervalued commodities and sell overvalued commodities, often but not always simultaneously. AAA used options to attempt either to reduce or define risks.  AAA was aware of price trends but did not trade upon trends. AAA often took profits in positions with specific trends even though that trend may still have been intact or perhaps even strong. AAA occasionally established positions that were countertrend.  Effective risk management was a crucial aspect of AAA's trading program. Account size, expectation, volatility of the market traded and the nature of other positions taken were all factors in determining the amount of equity committed to each trade. The Master was AAA's largest account.  (a) Liquidity.  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services. Its assets are its (i) equity in its trading account, consisting of cash at MS&Co. and cash margin, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, options purchased at fair value and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (ii) cash at bank and (iii) interest receivable. Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership, through its investments in the Funds and direct investments. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.  To minimize the risk relating to low margin deposits, the Partnership and the Master, prior to the Master's full redemption, followed certain trading policies, including:  (i) The Partnership invested its assets only in commodity interests that the Advisor believed were traded in sufficient volume to permit ease of taking and liquidating positions. Sufficient volume, in this context, referred to a level of liquidity that the Advisor believed permitted it to enter and exit trades without noticeably moving the market.  (ii) The Advisor did not initiate additional positions in any commodity if these positions would have resulted in aggregate positions requiring a margin of more than 66 2/3% of the Partnership's net assets allocated to the Advisor.  (iii) The Partnership may have occasionally accepted delivery of a commodity. Unless such delivery was disposed of promptly by retendering the warehouse receipt representing the delivery to the appropriate clearinghouse, the physical commodity position was fully hedged.  (iv) The Partnership did not employ the trading technique commonly known as "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as margin for the purchases or sale of additional positions in the same or related commodities.  (v) The Partnership did not utilize borrowings other than short-term borrowings if the Partnership took delivery of any cash commodities.  (vi) The Advisor may have, from time to time, employed trading strategies such as spreads or straddles on behalf of the Partnership. "Spreads" and "straddles" describe commodity futures trading strategies involving the simultaneous buying and selling of futures contracts on the same commodity but involving different delivery dates or markets.  (vii) The Partnership did not permit the churning of its commodity trading account. The term "churning" refers to the practice of entering and exiting trades with a frequency unwarranted by legitimate efforts to profit from the trades, driven by the desire to generate commission income.  From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the Partnership's average margin to equity ratio (i.e., the percentage of assets on deposit required for margin) was approximately 5.6%.  In the normal course of business, the Partnership is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, including derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments. These financial instruments may include futures, options, and swaps, whose values are based upon an underlying asset, index, or reference rate, and generally represent future commitments to exchange currencies or cash balances, or to purchase or sell other financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates, or, in the case of derivative commodity instruments, to have a reasonable possibility to be settled in cash, through physical delivery or with another financial instrument. These instruments may trade on an exchange or over-the-counter ("OTC"). Exchange-traded instruments include futures and certain standardized forward, option and swap contracts. Certain swap contracts may also trade on a swap execution facility or OTC. OTC contracts are negotiated between contracting parties and also include certain forward and option contracts. Specific market movements of commodities or futures contracts underlying an option cannot accurately be predicted. The purchaser of an option may lose the entire premium paid for the option. The writer, or seller, of an option has unlimited risk. Each of these instruments is subject to various risks similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments, including market and credit risk. In general, the risks associated with OTC contracts are greater than those associated with exchange-traded instruments because of the greater risk of default by the counterparty to an OTC contract. None of the Partnership's current contracts are traded OTC, although contracts may be traded OTC in the future.  As both a buyer and seller of options, the Partnership and/or the Master, as applicable, paid or received a premium at the outset and then assumed the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options exposed the Partnership/Master to potentially unlimited liability; for purchased options, the risk of loss was limited to the premiums paid. Certain written put options permitted cash settlement and did not require the option holder to own the reference asset. The Partnership/Master did not consider these contracts to be guarantees.  Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of the financial instruments traded by the Partnership due to market changes, including interest and foreign exchange rate movements and fluctuations in commodity or security prices. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded by the Partnership. The Partnership is exposed to a market risk equal to the value of futures contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short.  Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur due to the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contract. In the event of a counterparty default, the Partnership's risk of loss is typically limited to the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Condition and is not represented by the contract or notional amounts of the instruments. The Partnership's risk of loss is reduced through the use of legally enforceable master netting agreements with counterparties that permit the Partnership to offset unrealized gains and losses and other assets and liabilities with such counterparties upon the occurrence of certain events. The Partnership/Master had credit risk and concentration risk during the reporting period and prior periods, as MS&Co. and/or CGM or their affiliates were the counterparties or brokers with respect to the Partnership's/Master's assets. During the reporting period and prior periods, credit risk with respect to exchange-traded instruments was reduced to the extent that, through MS&Co./CGM, the Partnership's/Master's counterparty was an exchange or clearing organization. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risks with respect to MS&Co.  The risk to the limited partners that have purchased Redeemable Units is limited to the amount of their share of the Partnership's net assets and undistributed profits. This limited liability is a result of the organization of the Partnership as a limited partnership under New York law.  During the reporting period and prior periods, the Advisor concentrated the Partnership's/Master's trading in energy-related markets. Concentration in a limited number of commodity interests may have subjected the Partnership's/Master's account to greater volatility than if a more diversified portfolio of contracts had been traded on behalf of the Partnership/Master. The Partnership continues to be subject to such risk.  The General Partner monitors and attempts to control the Partnership's risk exposure on a daily basis through financial, credit and risk management monitoring systems, and accordingly, believes that it had effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which the Partnership may have been subject. These monitoring systems generally allowed the General Partner to statistically analyze actual trading results with risk-adjusted performance indicators and correlation statistics. In addition, online monitoring systems provided account analysis of futures, forward and option contracts by sector, margin requirements, gain and loss transactions and collateral positions. (See also "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on financial instrument risks included in the notes to financial statements.)  The majority of these instruments matured within one year of the inception date. However, due to the nature of the Partnership's business, these instruments may not have been held to maturity.  Other than the risks inherent in U.S. Treasury bills, money market mutual fund securities, commodity futures, options and swaps trading, the Partnership/Master knew of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties which would have resulted in or which are reasonably likely to have resulted in the Partnership's/Master's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may cause the Partnership to cease trading operations and liquidate all open positions under certain circumstances, including a decrease in net asset value per Redeemable Unit to less than $400 as of the close of business on any business day.  (i) The Partnership has made no material commitments for capital expenditures.  (ii) The Partnership's capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by gains or losses on trading and by expenses, interest income, redemptions of Redeemable Units and distributions of profits, if any. Gains or losses on trading cannot be predicted. Market movements in commodities are dependent upon fundamental and technical factors which the Advisor may or may not be able to identify, such as changing supply and demand relationships, weather, government, agricultural, commercial and trade programs and policies, national and international political and economic events and changes in interest rates. Partnership expenses consist of, among other things, clearing, ongoing, selling agent, management and general partner fees. The level of these expenses is dependent upon the level of trading and the ability of the Advisor to identify and take advantage of price movements in the commodity markets, in addition to the level of net assets maintained. In addition, the amount of interest income earned by the Partnership is dependent upon (1) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership's account, (2) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and (3) interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor MS&Co. has no control.  No forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period. A limited partner may require the Partnership to redeem its Redeemable Units at their net asset value as of the end of a month on three business days' notice to the General Partner. There is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions. Redemptions generally are funded out of the Partnership's cash holdings. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 1,129.9510 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $8,754,535 and 19.2260 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $170,002. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 1,543.6390 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $13,149,456 and 11.4980 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $99,837. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 3,117.2310 limited partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $27,551,394, 74.8040 General Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $644,924 and 118.5047 Special Limited Partner Redeemable Units were redeemed totaling $1,038,273.  Redeemable Units were sold to persons and entities who are accredited investors as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.  (c) Results of Operations.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit increased 7.4% from $8,179.21 to $8,783.96. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit decreased 6.6% from $8,761.45 to $8,179.21. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Redeemable Unit decreased 3.6% from $9,093.12 to $8,761.45.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $1,849,550 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of commodity futures in natural gas. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The Partnership recorded its most significant gains during the last week of July as the Partnership benefitted from a move from net short positioning in natural gas futures to net long. Driven by increasingly hot, dry weather in the U.S., a seasonably weak increase in inventories, and growing demand from power generation, natural gas prices rallied strongly in the final days of the month. Gains were also achieved during September from the Partnership's long positioning as a surge in natural gas prices during the second week of the month provided most of the Partnership's gains for the month. The release of industry reports which showed a flattening supply outlook combined with increased demand nationally for natural gas drove prices higher in September. The Partnership also recorded gains throughout the latter half of August as the Partnership's advisor increased overall long exposure at the same time that natural gas prices began to rally, spurred by extremely hot temperatures in the U.S. which bolstered cooling demand from homes and businesses. During October, gains were achieved late in the month as mild weather patterns in the U.S. caused natural gas prices to plunge, benefitting the Partnership's short positions. Gains were also achieved during May as prices fell dramatically over the first several days of the month and followed with choppy price action closing out a volatile first week, benefitting the Partnership's short positioning. A portion of the Partnership's gains for the year was offset by losses incurred during February from long positions in natural gas futures as mild weather throughout much of the U.S. limited demand for natural gas and moved prices dramatically lower. The Partnership's net long positioning was also negatively affected during February after the release of U.S. Energy Information Administration (the "EIA") reports which indicated that output from U.S. shale formations was overwhelming demand for fuel and inflated the largest natural gas supply glut in the U.S. in four years. Losses were recorded during November from the Partnership's net short natural gas positioning as prices rallied sharply over the month's final days. Additional losses were experienced during April as choppy price actions dominated natural gas markets during the first half of the month. A spike in natural gas prices due to unseasonably cold weather in the Northeastern U.S. during the latter half of April also adversely affected the Partnership's positions. Smaller losses were recorded during the early days of March as a sharp drop in natural gas prices negatively affected the Partnership's long positions.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $670,244 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of commodity futures in natural gas.  The Partnership recorded the most significant losses during February. Losses were incurred at the start of the February due to short positions in natural gas futures after severe weather in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast spurred demand for heating from homes and businesses. In the middle of February, weather again drove natural gas prices higher as much of the country faced colder-than-normal temperatures. Additionally, an industry report released in mid-Februaryindicated that the number of working natural gas rigs in the U.S. decreased during January adding further upward pressure to gas prices. During December, losses were experienced as milder-  than-normal weather throughout much of the U.S. pushed natural gas prices lower, negatively affecting the Partnership's net long positioning. Additional losses were recorded during June as an increase in prices early in the month resulted in losses for the Fund's short-biased positions. Later in June, following a move to a net long positioning, the Fund recorded further losses as prices moved lower on weak cooling demand driven by mild weather in much of the U.S. Losses were also incurred during July as falling natural gas prices driven by robust supplies, mild temperatures, and low demand in the U.S. negatively affected the Partnership's net long bias during the month. The Partnership's natural gas positions also recorded smaller losses during April, May, and October. A portion of the Partnership's losses during the year was offset by gains achieved during March as a fall in natural gas prices at the start of the month positively affected short positions. The Partnership's short positioning bias also benefitted from the release of an Energy Information Agency report in the middle of March which indicated that residential and business natural gas consumption fell during the early stages of the month. Mild weather that blanketed many of the major gas-consuming regions in the U.S. throughout March combined with the release of a report which showed that natural gas inventories advanced from the same period in the previous year to help the Partnership's short positions record profits during the latter half of March. Smaller gains were recorded during November.  Interest income on 80% of the Partnership's average daily equity maintained in cash during each month was earned at the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate. Any interest earned on the Partnership's account in excess of the amount described above, if any, will be retained by MS&Co. and/or shared with the General Partner. All interest earned on U.S. Treasury bills and money market fund securities will be retained by the Partnership. Interest income earned directly for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 increased by $9,136 and $35,815, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in interest income is primarily due to higher 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rates along with additional interest income earned on U.S. Treasury bills during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. Interest earned by the Partnership will increase the net asset value of the Partnership. The amount of interest income earned by the Partnership depends on (i) the average daily equity maintained in cash in the Partnership's account, (ii) the amount of U.S. Treasury bills and/or money market mutual fund securities held by the Partnership and (iii) interest rates over which neither the Partnership nor MS&Co. has control.  Clearing fees are based on the number of trades executed by the Advisor for the Partnership. Accordingly, they must be compared in relation to the number of trades executed during the period. Clearing fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $26,361 and $87,640, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of trades made by the Advisor during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  Ongoing selling agent fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Ongoing selling agent fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $53,390 and $188,593, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower average net assets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015.  Management fees are calculated as a percentage of the Partnership's net asset value as of the end of each month and are affected by trading performance and redemptions. Accordingly, they must be analyzed in relation to the fluctuations in the monthly net asset values. Management fees for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $33,309 and $117,789, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to lower average net assets during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. In addition, no management fee was charged to the Partnership for the period from January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2015.  General Partner fees are paid to the General Partner for administering the business and affairs of the Partnership, including, among other things,  Special Limited Partner profit share allocations are based on the new trading profits generated by the Advisor at the end of the quarter, as defined in the advisory agreement among the Partnership, the General Partner and the Advisor. The profit share allocation made to the Special Limited Partner for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $36,393. There were no profit share allocations made for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The Special Limited Partner will not receive a profit share allocation until the Advisor recovers the net loss incurred and earns additional new trading profits for the Partnership.  The Partnership pays professional fees, which generally include legal, accounting expenses, administrative, filing, reporting and data processing fees. Professional fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $185,033 and $206,231, respectively.  . . .  Mar 28, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(the “Fund”), and may not be relied upon in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.

Futures trading is speculative and involves a high degree of risk.  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

By accessing this site, you hereby represent that you are an accredited investor as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 501 under the Securities Act of 1933. Specifically, an accredited investor is defined as meeting one or more of the following qualifications:

A.	An individual whose net worth, or joint net worth with spouse, exceeds $1,000,000 as of the date of a subscription agreement.   Net worth means the excess of total assets at fair market value, excluding one’s primary residence, over total liabilities.  In making this determination, the related amount of indebtedness secured by the primary residence up to its fair market value may be excluded in calculating net worth.  However, indebtedness secured by the residence in excess of the value of the home is considered a liability and should be deducted from net worth.

B.	An individual whose gross income exceeded $200,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years, or whose joint gross income with the individual’s spouse exceeded $300,000 in each of the two most recent calendar years and, in either case, the individual has reasonable expectation of his single or joint gross income, respectively, reaching the same level in the current year.

C.	A partnership, corporation, limited liability company or business trust that either (i) is 100% owned by individuals who are accredited investors under (a) or (b) above, or (ii) was not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the Fund and whose total assets exceed $5,000,000.
D.	An employee benefit plan:  (i) whose investment decision is made by a plan fiduciary (as defined in ERISA §3(21)) that is a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment adviser; (ii) whose total assets exceed $5,000,000 as of the date of a subscription agreement; or (iii) if a self-directed plan, whose investment decisions are made solely by persons who are accredited investors.

E.	A U.S. bank, U.S. savings and loan association or other similar U.S. institution acting in its individual or fiduciary capacity.

F.	A broker-dealer registered pursuant to §15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
