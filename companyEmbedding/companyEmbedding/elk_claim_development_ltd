Drugs & Medical Devices

Drugs and medical device attorneysA U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report shows 40 percent of Americans take at least one prescription drug and that one in six is on at least three prescription medications for symptoms related to everything from acne and arthritis to cancer and cholesterol. As far as medical devices go, it's next to impossible to determine how many patients use them. In some cases, especially where new drugs and devices are concerned, patient safety can take a back seat to manufacturers' drive to earn dollars. That's where a hardworking drug and device recall lawyer like those at Elk & Elk Co., Ltd., comes in handy.When profits are more important than people, defective and dangerous products are sold as cures for our ailments. If you or a loved one has used a dangerous or recalled drug or medical device, our injury lawyers can help. Call 1-800-ELK-OHIO or contact us online to schedule your free consultation.Medical device recalls are on the rise. Make sure you have an experienced advocate on your side.One study, released in the Journal of the American Medical Association, shows more than 100,000 people die each year in the U.S. from adverse reactions to medications that were properly prescribed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Another 2.2 million Americans suffer nonfatal but serious reactions to prescription drugs. With this many prescription drug-related injuries and deaths, you've got to question how some of these drugs ever get approved.What's even scarier is the rising number of medical devices recalled annually. In 2008, nearly 2,500 medical devices were recalled, the FDA reported. That was almost double the number from 2007 and a 164 percent increase over the number or devices recalled in 2000. With numbers like these, the medical device scene is a scary one. If you or someone you know has been injured by a defective medical device or a recalled drug, you don't have to face the aftermath alone.Ohio attorneys handling all types of product recallsWhen you begin taking prescription drugs or use a medical device, you're trusting that they'll improve your quality of life. But if they're recalled because they're defective or dangerous, that trust can be shattered.Instead of the help you needed, all you got was more pain and suffering.That's when you need someone on your side, fighting to restore quality and dignity to your life.For 50 years, the law firm of Elk & Elk has faithfully served the citizens of Ohio, helping thousands of victims of recalled drugs and medical devices seek justice.

Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

Xarelto: Stroke prevention drug may cause cerebral hemorrhaging and internal bleeding

Fatal bleeding and serious injuries have been linked to the popular anticoagulant Xarelto
					® (Rivaroxaban). If you or someone you love suffered internal bleeding or wrongful death as a result of taking Xarelto, you should contact the Ohio drug recall lawyers at Elk & Elk Co., Ltd. to protect your rights.
				
Call 1-800-ELK-OHIO or contact us online to schedule a free consultation with some of the most experienced personal injury lawyers in Ohio. For 50 years, our defective product lawyers have been helping the hardworking people of Ohio. Call today to learn how we can help.

Xarelto linked to bleeding-related deaths


Xarelto is a next generation anti-coagulant (blood thinner) designed to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (a-fib not due to valve problems), deep vein thrombosis (blood clot deep in the body) and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs). It is also approved for patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery to prevent the development of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011.
				
In a 
					letter dated June 6, 2013, the FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion said a print ad for Xarelto was "false or misleading because it minimizes the risks associated with Xarelto and makes a misleading claim."
				

Know the risk. Know the symptoms.

If you take Xarelto, you may be at risk for serious internal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhaging or even death. Contact the Ohio Xarelto injury lawyers if you experience any of the signs or symptoms of bleeding listed below - you may be entitled to compensation for your injuries:

Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:

Nosebleeds that happen often

Unusual bleeding from gums


Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding

Bleeding that is severe or that you cannot control

Red, pink, or brown urine

Bright red or black stools (looks like tar)

Cough up blood or blood clots

Vomiting blood or vomit that looks like "coffee grounds"

Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites

Frequent bleeding and bruising

The makers of Xarelto claim the drug doesn't require blood tests. Unfortunately, for patients who experience serious hemorrhaging, there is no known antidote to stop the bleeding.

WARNING: If you are taking Xarelto, consult your health care professional before stopping use of the drug.


Call 1-800-ELK-OHIO for a free consultation if you have suffered after using Xarelto

Elk & Elk is actively investigating cases where Xarelto users suffered severe bleeding from taking Xarelto. The Ohio drug recall lawyers at Elk & Elk have 50 years of experience handling drug injury cases. If you or a loved one suffered serious internal bleeding, cerebral hemorrhaging or death after taking Xarelto, let Elk & Elk handle your Xarelto lawsuit. Our injury lawyers, doctors, nurses, accident reconstructionists, accountants and other experts will work hard to help you and your loved ones get the justice you deserve.
Pick up the phone and call 1-800-ELK-OHIO for a free consultation today. You can also fill out our no-obligation 
					online contact form. When you choose Elk & Elk, there's never a fee unless we win.

 Gathering dicamba data needed for documentation			 July 27, 2017/0 Comments/in Association News, Board Members & Staff, Council News, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council /by Minnesota SoybeanMinnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA) Director Lawrence Sukalski has reached out to his crop insurance agent to discuss dicamba, and he advises fellow growers not to hesitate reporting suspected dicamba damage in their fields. 
“Most importantly, growers who think they might be suffering from dicamba damage need to make sure they’re covered for insurance reasons before it’s too late in the season,” the Martin County farmer says. “They shouldn’t be afraid to file a report. We want to be as diligent as we can on the dicamba issue to properly manage this, and that starts with documentation.”
Earlier this week, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) had reported receiving 54 dicamba-related complaints, well below the numbers seen in other states.
Joshua Stamper, MDA’s Pesticide & Fertilizer Management Division director, says the names of people filing potential dicamba-related complaints are kept private within the department, and aren’t shared publicly. 
“The potential for drift is always going to be there, but we don’t believe these cases to be off-label uses,” Stamper says. “We do advise farmers to follow the best management practices, cross their Ts and dot their Is.”
Stamper says a complaint doesn’t necessarily mean dicamba drift is to blame; other culprits and factors could be to blame. Most complaints are inspected in approximately one week. 
“Drift, volatility and failure to properly clean sprayers, these are all on the table for causes, but it’s hard to know unless folks report and document any damage they might observe,” says Tom Peters, extension agronomist at North Dakota State University. “This is important because the only way we can learn more about dicamba drift is by compiling the reported data. We need to see the full numbers before issuing any conclusions.” 
Sukalski says MSGA is taking the issue seriously and proceeding with caution, but there is no cause for alarm at this stage. 
“We’re trying our best to collaborate with industry partners and the MDA to find a solution,” he says. “MSGA is holding meetings and working hard to get the word out there that if you think you’ve experienced dicamba damage, the best course is to report it.” 
For more information, growers can visit XtendiMax’s application requirement page or call 1-844-RRXTEND for questions regarding performance issues with a Monstano dicamba product.
DuPont recommends users always consult label and state requirements before applying FeXapan™ herbicide plus VaporGrip® Technology.
For stewardship information, product details and training around tank mix guidelines, nozzles and operating pressure, boom height, application timing, wind speed, ground speeds, buffer requirements, triple-rinse cleanout procedure and additional topics, visit FeXapan’s website and application requirements page. 
MDA has also posted a dicamba fact sheet.
Growers can file a private complaint with MDA on their pesticide website

Minnesota Soybean2017-07-27 16:12:252017-07-27 17:11:06Gathering dicamba data needed for documentation Farm Bill discussion draws engaged crowd			 July 27, 2017/0 Comments/in Association News, Events, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association /by Minnesota SoybeanThe forthcoming Farm Bill was discussed among concerned and passionate citizens at the Mankato VFW during a dialogue session hosted by Minnesota Farmers Union. 
“Farmers need certainty,” says Chuck Ackman, Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s outreach director. “Don’t do a six-month (extension).” 
The future of the Farm Bill, however, remains vague and unclear.
“All we know for sure about the next Farm Bill is it will be printed on paper,” says Bruce Miller of Minnesota Farmers Union. “But it’s an important piece of legislation.” 
About 50 members from the area, including Minnesota state Sen. Nick Frentz, state Rep. Clark Johnson and staffers for senators and congressmen, were on hand to discuss their concerns with a three-person panel from National Farmers Union and Minnesota Department of Agriculture. 
Crop insurance, rural broadband access, the federal budget and the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program (SNAP) were all discussed at length. 
“The bill needs to be drafted according to the needs of rural America,” says Rob Larew, National Farmers Union senior vice president of public policy and communications. “Whether it’s crop insurance, conservation or SNAP, these are all safety nets for our community.”
The current Farm Bill, which expires in fall 2018, represents less than two percent of the entire federal budget. SNAP makes up about 75 percent of the Farm Bill, and President Trump’s proposed budget would cut SNAP by $190 billion (about 25 percent) over 10 years.
“When you take all those portions of the budget that no one’s willing to cut – like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on our debt, defense spending –suddenly the ag part of the budget become a much bigger target,” says Lawler, who has worked on four Farm Bills. “I always ask folks to look at it in context, that the Farm Bill takes up such a small part of the overall budget.”
Forty seven million American are on SNAP, and economic reports indicate $5 in SNAP benefits generate about $10 in economic activity. In Minnesota, more than 85 farmer’s market accept SNAP.  Allegations of SNAP fraud are a myth, says Sophia Lenarz-Coy, associate director of Hunter Solutions Minnesota. 
“We’re really interested in protecting SNAP. It’s an important story to tell in terms of the economic impact it has for growers,” Lenarz-Coy says. “A lot of people are just doing the best they can. SNAP has a great track record and brings a lot of money into our state. And it’s the moral thing to do, right? People should be able to afford food, and there are people struggling to make ends meet farming who qualify for SNAP. ” 
Rep. Johnson believes it’s important the farm bill is broad to garner more support. 
“We need these other additions to add to the political coalition,” he says.
Sen. Frentz agreed with others who stated rural broadband is in dire need of upgrades.
“I’m surprised rural broadband is not more of an issue,” he says. “Farmers need better broadband access; one of the best things we can do for them is to make sure they have internet, so I encourage everyone to speak up on that issue.” 
Lawler says he would take the crowd’s comments back with him to Washington, D.C.
“We’re very much engaged with all the messages we’re hearing in meetings like this, and making sure they are being delivered to our congressional members,” he says. “The committees are very much engaged in getting this Farm Bill up and running.”

As spraying season is underway, Monsanto says it’s important to review application requirements prior to using a product to enable successful on-target application and maximize your weed control. XtendiMax herbicide with VaporGrip Technology has specific requirements for nozzles, adjuvants, drift reducing agents (DRAs), and tank mix partners designed to help minimize off-target movement and enable responsible use of the herbicide.

Minnesota Soybean2017-07-20 14:53:162017-07-20 14:53:16MDA: Dicamba complaints lower than other states Pruitt discusses WOTUS with Minnesota ag leaders			 July 20, 2017/0 Comments/in Association News, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, Water /by Minnesota SoybeanEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt expressed his department’s support for agriculture during a round-table discussion Wednesday hosted by AgriGrowth at the Securian Center in St. Paul.
“We see you as partners, not your adversaries,” Pruitt told about 25 Minnesota ag representatives. “To say that farmers, who are the stewards of their land, don’t take care of the land is a D.C. mindset.” 
Pruitt visited Minnesota during a multi-state tour to explain the EPA’s recent proposal to rescind the Clean Water Rule and re-codify the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 defining “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS). 
“What the (2015) ruling did was give the EPA authority to make judgment calls,” Pruitt says. “I believe the Wall Street Journal said this, but we want to be ‘Peer-reviewed, not pal-reviewed.'”
The review comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s February executive order reviewing WOTUS, ensuring pollution control and promoting economic growth. Pruitt says the proposed rule would be in accordance with Supreme Court decisions, agency guidelines and longstanding practices. 
“We as an agency can’t make it up as we go along,” Pruitt says. “That’s what the last administration did. … WOTUS was so extreme.” 
Pruitt says he favors a more narrow definition of public waters as part of the EPA’s “back to basics” approach. 
“The rule created uncertainty as applied,” he says. “The EPA shouldn’t be an ebb-and-flow (agency). Science should be independent…This is the first in a two-step process to redefine WOTUS. It’s something that has to be fixed.” 
Pruitt railed against the agency’s role in regulatory oversights during previous administrations.
“We want to get to truth and data,” he says. “We want objective science driving our decisions.”
A diehard baseball fan, Pruitt labeled his agency in the beginning months of his tenure a “rookie ball” organization that is “batting .100.” 
“We’re getting vertical with the EPA,” he says. “That’s revolutionary at the EPA. The agency hasn’t done things on time. Everything wrong with regulatory power, we’re the poster child.” 
Later in the discussion, Pruitt indicated an interest in participating in an aerial tour of the Red River Valley.
Pruitt anticipates the EPA will releases its final ruling on WOTUS in the first quarter of 2018. 
“We’re going to get rid of the bad rules,” he says. “Then we’re going to do our job.”

His last round of Capitol Hill visits in Washington D.C. this week was a little bittersweet, he admits.

Corn area planted is estimated at 90.9 million acres, down 3 percent from last year.
Following up to the Prospective Plantings report released in late spring, NASS surveyed approximately 11,000 segments of land and 69,700 producers during the first two weeks of June to gather information on what farmers actually planted. Key findings released in the Acreage report include:

 MDA announces change to elk damage claim process			 September 20, 2016/0 Comments/in Association News, Council News, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council /by Minnesota SoybeanFor most Minnesota farmers, the prospects of having to file an elk damage claim are very limited. But for those northern farmers who are unfortunate to suffer damage on their properties, claims are inevitable.
With that said, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) wants producers to know the process has changed for submitting elk damage claims.
“Our elk claims process serves as an important financial lifeline for farmers,” said Andrea Vaubel, MDA Assistant Commissioner. “There aren’t many elk claims but the damage can be pretty significant when it occurs.”
According to Minnesota statute, the elk damage compensation program requires that crop loss must be investigated by a federal crop adjuster or County Extension agent in a timely manner.
Vaubel said that because of several factors, including the retirement of longtime extension educators in the north, the University of Minnesota Extension educators will no longer be able to verify elk claims.
“Producers will need to get in touch with their crop insurance agent to verify the damage,” she said.
While there are no “federal crop insurance adjusters” because of the privatization of the federal program, there are adjusters who have federally-supervised training. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has assured MDA that crop insurance companies are willing to do elk investigations for their customers.
Vaubel says that if producers don’t have crop insurance or have issues with their crop insurance company agreeing to verify a claim, they should contact Blane White, MDA Animal Damage Compensation Program Coordinator, at blane.white@state.mn.us or (651) 201-6578.
“Time is of the essence,” Vaubel said. “Claims have to be filed in a pretty timely manner.”
