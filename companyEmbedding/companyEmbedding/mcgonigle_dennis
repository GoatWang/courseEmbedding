McGonigle to Receive President’s Medal



  


















scranton.edu
July 22, 2017


July 22, 2017


 McGonigle to Receive President’s MedalDennis J. McGonigle ’82Dennis J. McGonigle ’82, chief financial officer and executive vice president at SEI Investments, will receive the University’s President’s Medal at the President’s Business Council (PBC) 16th Annual Award Dinner on Thursday, Oct. 5, at The Pierre in New York City.
McGonigle graduated from the University in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting and was a member of the Special Jesuit Liberal Arts (SJLA) Honors Program. He joined Arthur Andersen LLP after graduation and rose to the position of senior auditor. He moved to SEI in 1985 as a business manager and controller of the SEI mutual funds and SEI Financial Services, a subsidiary of SEI Investments. Over his 32-year career, he has worked across SEI in a number of leadership roles ranging from product and operations to market management, leading to his appointment as CFO in 2002. He has been a member of SEI’s executive committee since 1995 and serves on the board of directors of a number of SEI's subsidiaries.
In his current role as CFO, McGonigle is responsible for guiding the efforts of a number of teams within the company, including finance and accounting, corporate enterprise risk management, workforce development and the SEI Private Wealth Management unit. He is also integrally involved in the setting of SEI’s broader corporate strategy. Based in Oaks, Pa., and founded in 1968 as Simulated Environments Inc., SEI Investments is a leading global provider of asset management, investment processing and investment operations solutions for institutional and personal wealth management.
A member of the University’s board of trustees since 2008, McGonigle currently serves as vice chair of the board and will complete his tenure in May. He is a member of the University’s President’s Business Council and was recognized by the University in 2007 with the Frank J. O’Hara Distinguished Alumni Award. Dennis is a member of the Wharton Fellows program, an executive education program, at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the co-owner of Kimberton Whole Foods, a growing, regional chain of organic and natural foods markets. McGonigle served on the board of trustees of the Kimberton Waldorf School and on the board of directors of Wisdom Technologies Corporation. He is currently involved with the Vocation Office of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in promoting vocations to the priesthood.
A native of Pennsauken, N.J., Dennis graduated from Camden Catholic High School, where he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014 for outstanding achievements through scholarship, service and leadership. He and his wife, Rachel, reside in Chester Springs, Pa., and are blessed with three daughters: Audrey, Alyson and Alena.
In presenting the President’s Medal, the University and the PBC recognize individuals who have achieved excellence in their fields and demonstrated extraordinary compassion for others. The proceeds from the Annual Award Dinner go directly to the University’s Presidential Scholarship Endowment Fund and to supporting PBC activities. The black-tie gala is a wonderful celebration of Scranton and honorees whose lifetime achievements reflect the University’s mission of Catholic and Jesuit excellence and service. Through its 15 dinners, the PBC has generated $13 million for the scholarship fund.
The PBC will conduct its annual Executive Forum and Dinner Kickoff Receptions in Philadelphia on May 16 and in New York City on May 18. For more information on the PBC and ways to participate in this year’s dinner, please contact Executive Director Timothy J. Pryle ’89 at (570) 941-5837 or pbc@scranton.edu, or visit scranton.edu/pbc.
