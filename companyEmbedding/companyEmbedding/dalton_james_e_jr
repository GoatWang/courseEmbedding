            Will I be declined for an installment loan with a fair credit score?
          






An installment loan with a low APR could help you pay down high-interest card debt, but it could also damage your score if you are declined. Consider transferring balance to an existing 0-percent card instead.

            Computer Simulation Aims to Solve Colonoscopy’s Right
          






Some studies suggest that colonoscopy may not be as effective against cancers that develop in the right side of the colon.
Amy Knudsen, PhD, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, Mass., is creating a computer model to help explain why this happens.
