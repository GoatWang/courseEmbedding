Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 5-8 Year Series 9 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 5-8 Year Series 9 invests in a portfolio
of intermediate-term taxable bonds, generally maturing approximately 5 to 8     
years from the Date of Deposit. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of      
current income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust    
included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 500.

Estimated Current Return:         4.50%         
Estimated Long Term Return:       3.44%         

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the     
opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base    
this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This  
estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the   
average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value    
and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return 
accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates   
show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation    
can predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these          
estimates.

INVESCO                                                                         

Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current  
income and to preserve capital.                                                 

Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of        
intermediate-term taxable bonds. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor  
considered the following factors, among others:                                 

     o    each rated bond must have an "investment grade" or better rating by at
    least one credit rating agency, with at least a "BBB-" rating by
      Standard & Poor's or Fitch Ratings, or at least a "Baa3" rating by
     Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or, in the case of a bond with no
issued ratings, such a bond must have credit characteristics
        sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated
          as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Trust in the opinion of the
Sponsor;                                                    

    o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;                                               

o    the current income provided by the bonds;                        

  o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and                                                 

  o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.                                                       

   The portfolio generally consists of taxable bonds maturing approximately 5 to
8 years from the Date of Deposit. On the Date of Deposit, certain of the bonds  
may be rated at least investment grade by one or more credit rating agency, yet 
rated below investment grade/unrated by the others. Following the Date of       
Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated by one or more credit rating agency, or a 
rating may be reduced, even to below investment grade ("BBB-" or "Baa3"), and   
the Trust could continue to hold such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration".                                                                

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can     
happen for reasons such as these:                                               

     o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.                                                       

o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in 
         general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or
fall in the future.                                         

o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or   
principal payments in the future.                           

    o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
       may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
         may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.                                                     

o    The financial markets, including those for corporate bonds, have 
       recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility.
         Due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets, there
        can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuer's
        assets or the extent of its obligations. For these or other reasons,
        the ratings of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio may not accurately
         reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of
the bond.                                                   

o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated    
         maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
        you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond.   

 o    We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited
        circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.    

(2)  During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units         
     represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs
    of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be
  deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after
     the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are
     redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from
    the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public
Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge. 

(3)  After the first settlement date (June 25, 2015), you will pay accrued      
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization    
costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income.      

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.                                   

(6)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.

For an explanation of the footnotes used on this page, see "Notes to Portfolio".

Notes to Portfolio                                                              

(1)  The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for  
    the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
     affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
     acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from June 17, 2015 to
June 22, 2015.                                                        

(2)  The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side     
   valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined
    by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth
 under "Public Offering--Unit Price". In accordance with FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and  
Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as Level 2, which 
 refers to security prices determined using other significant observable
   inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would
use in pricing a security. These may include quoted market prices for 
    similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. The
cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is $6,001,618 and the  
Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $28,063.                                

"+" indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company.          

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate 
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the 
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is  
included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the   
     maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed
    delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
    Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to
take place at various dates after the first settlement date.          

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an 
    original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". The tax effect of
 bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in "Federal Tax
Status".                                                              

(3)  "o" indicates that the rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating     
  agency of a policy of insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. All
ratings are by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, unless    
otherwise indicated. "*" indicates a security rating by Fitch. "NR"   
   indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond.
    For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement.                                               

(4)  With respect to any bonds presenting a redemption feature in this column,  
    this is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at   
   declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
 price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
     date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with 
   respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption
     without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".  

(5)  Certain bonds have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole  
  or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price
    that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such bond, a
 "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
  redemption. The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if
 any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of
    principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest
accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if    
redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining 
    principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond
     and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations
   or municipal obligations, as applicable, with maturities corresponding to
     the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which
  the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had
    not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being
    redeemed. In addition, the bonds may also be subject to redemption without
premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory   
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".  

Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the    
following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal            
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Unitholders of Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 5-8 Year Series 9 
(included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 500):                   

   We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the related
portfolio of Investment Grade Corporate Trust, 5-8 Year Series 9 (included in   
Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 500) as of June 22, 2015. The        
statement of condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.     

   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement
of condition is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit       
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis  
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but   
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such      
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the statement of condition, assessing the        
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as    
well as evaluating the overall statement of condition presentation. Our         
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of  
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities
as shown in the statement of condition as of June 22, 2015. We believe that our 
audit of the statement of condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Corporate

(1)  The value of the bonds is determined by Standard & Poor's Securities       
Evaluations, Inc. on the bases set forth under "Public Offering--Unit
Price". The contracts to purchase bonds are collateralized by an      
irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to satisfy such  
contracts.                                                            

(2)  The Trustee will advance the amount of the net interest accrued to the     
   first settlement date to the Trust for distribution to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of such date.                                 

(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash        
sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in       
establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under 
     "Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will
  be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the
close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the  
 Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors
will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the
Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated       
     organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to
the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust.                

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York   
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets,  
Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, 
Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York        
Mellon, as Trustee.                                                             

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to       
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

  On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". The bonds initially consist of delivery statements relating to    
contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable      
letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in
exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the   
number of Units indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information". A 
Trust that holds primarily intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of
the prospectus, is referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". Unless   
otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at  
the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution
in the case of an Intermediate Term Trust.                                      

Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in 
the principal and net income of the Trust. The number of Units is determined    
based upon a $1,000 principal amount of bonds in the Trust per Unit. To the     
extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided     
interest in the Trust represented by each Unit will increase, although the      
actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain           
outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust 
Agreement.                                                                      

Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of an Intermediate-Term Trust is
to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing  
in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term bonds. There is, of    
course, no guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be 
an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a  
portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be 
able to acquire individually.                                                   

In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as     
listed under "Principal Investment Strategy", (b) the prices of the bonds       
relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current     
income provided by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of 
issue and location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal  
or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be  
rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of 
Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be   
considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the    
Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Income Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") 
during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your           
investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, 
which is available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks   
related to your investment.                                                     

Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States  
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S.
and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period,  
including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity. 
The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat 
the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these        
measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S.      
Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing       
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future 
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates
over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating       
Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States  
of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the   
statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial    
change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant        
valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings.                       

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

 Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves
more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks   
can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price.   
These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and     
social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including   
withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of          
securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or         
repatriation of currencies.                                                     

 The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in     
these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts, 
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is   
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company  
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.   
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult 
for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with       
respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments,      
including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional     
conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and       
securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in   
non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have 
on the Trust's portfolio securities.                                            

Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,  
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.     
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies  
than about most U.S. companies.                                                 

Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more   
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable 
to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.           

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United     
States are at or near historic lows, which may increase the Trust's exposure to 
risks associated with rising interest rates.                                    

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the     
bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the     
original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the     
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might    
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price  
could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below    
the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount    
you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust   
could terminate early.                                                          

Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or 
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other        
events. Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified     
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are  
often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See  
"Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal
Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds 
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in   
general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section,    
and the notes thereto.                                                          

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified   
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of    
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be             
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the 
following sections.                                                             

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond  
both default in making their payment obligations.                               

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net      
asset value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for   
any bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market     
(they are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties     
currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services         
industry, many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a   
result of such illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional    
bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests.                              

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue 
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the   
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly 
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.   
The types of bonds in your Trust are listed under "Portfolio". These bonds are  
also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.                 

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. All other     
municipal bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds.                                

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment.                                                                        

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and     
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local     
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy    
for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by  
the United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue     
Service ("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest  
payable to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and 
are designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds).                    

  The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the        
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable  
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build      
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the     
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds  
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay       
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a    
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for 
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to 
have this subsection of the Code apply.                                         

  Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such      
issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's    
ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds   
are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to      
Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other       
federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy      
payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.         

  Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable      
bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and        
municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy   
payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring       
Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18,
2010, permits issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond   
interest payments.                                                              

Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the 
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair 
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a      
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds 
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy        
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction  
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation   
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean          
Renewable Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy         
facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not       
restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar   
amounts that may be issued for these bond types.                                

Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for   
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and 
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as    
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School          
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of  
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal      
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified 
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy  
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or 
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.       
Treasury.                                                                       

Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it  
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,     
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even      
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section  
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of    
any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer  
after three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be  
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is   
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to        
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of    
the Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal 
cash subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.           

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting               
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate      
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments   
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their   
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient 
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments   
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for       
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the     
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and 
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).    

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number   
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,      
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or       
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or        
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally 
prepayable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their    
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,         
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of      
subsidies.                                                                      

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates    
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate     
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends   
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from  
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,     
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation 
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of  
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                 

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues  
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand    
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government           
regulation and rate approvals.                                                  

  State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal
bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of a state    
may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental         
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional    
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local 
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain 
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,     
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their             
obligations.                                                                    

  The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are        
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with     
exports and industry deregulation.                                              

A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final     
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Corporate Bond Industry Risks. Your Trust may invest significantly in     
certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a     
greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over       
several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before  
you invest.                                                                     

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various     
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the overall state   
of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in  
the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can    
negatively impact spending habits. Global factors including political           
developments, imposition of import controls, fluctuations in oil prices, and    
changes in exchange rates may adversely affect issuers of consumer products and 
services.                                                                       

  Competitiveness in the retail industry may require large capital outlays for
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track    
the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell  
their products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers,   
but may require sophisticated technology to remain competitive. Changes in      
demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for, and the        
success of, consumer products and services in the marketplace. Consumer         
products and services companies may be subject to government regulation         
affecting their products and operations which may negatively impact             
performance. Tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws,           
regulations and litigation.                                                     

Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by banks and other financial services companies. In general, financial   
services issuers are substantially affected by changes in economic and market   
conditions, including: the liquidity and volatility levels in the global        
financial markets; interest rates, as well as currency and commodities prices;  
investor sentiment; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of    
capital and credit; exposure to various geographic markets or in commercial and 
residential real estate; competition from new entrants in their fields of       
business; and the overall health of the U.S. and international economies.       

The financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global
developments over the last few years including recessionary conditions,         
deterioration in the credit markets and recurring concerns over sovereign debt. 
A substantial amount of assets have been written down by financial              
institutions, with the impact of these losses forcing a number of large         
traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and insurers into either    
liquidation or combination. This also has drastically increasing the credit     
risk, and possibility of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced    
with these problems. Many of the institutions may continue to experience        
difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance their operations and in       
maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. While the U.S. and foreign    
governments, and their respective government agencies, have taken steps to      
address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions,      
there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in          
financial services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps.            

 Such economic and political conditions and increased public scrutiny during
the past few years have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the  
U.S. and abroad, creating additional challenges for financial institutions.     
Regulatory initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the      
world may be inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial   
services issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance  
and legal costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and   
liquidity costs. These laws and regulations may affect the manner in which a    
particular financial institution does business and the products and services it 
may provide. Increased regulation may restrict a company's ability to compete   
in its current businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New       
regulations may reduce or limit a company's revenue or impose additional fees,  
assessments or taxes on those companies and intensify regulatory supervision,   
adversely affecting business operations or leading to other negative            
consequences.                                                                   

Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial    
crisis has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act   
(the "Dodd-Frank Act"), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The          
Dodd-Frank Act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to   
address emerging risks and issues in the nation's evolving financial system. It 
also establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as    
systemic risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and    
federal consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually  
all participants in the financial services industry for years to come,          
including banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage    
lenders, insurance companies, industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and     
other securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds, 
consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure.      
These regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain issuers in your    
Trust, and could lead to decreases in such issuers' profits or revenues. In     
many cases the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial institution's   
business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be     
completed. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the          
Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your Trust   
or on the financial services industry in general.                               

 Developments in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, including the potential
for further downgrades of sovereign credit ratings, as well as downgrades to    
the ratings of the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, could adversely   
affect financial services issuers. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone   
country from use of the Euro could lead to serious disruptions to foreign       
exchanges, operations and settlements, which may have an adverse effect on      
financial services issuers.                                                     

 The financial condition of customers, clients and counterparties, including
other financial institutions, could adversely affect financial services         
issuers. Financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of             
market-making, trading, clearing or other counterparty relationships. Many of   
these transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result 
of the actions of, or deterioration in, the commercial soundness of other       
counterparty financial institutions. Economic and market conditions may         
increase credit exposures due to the increased risk of customer, client or      
counterparty default. Downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services    
issuers could have a negative effect on liquidity, cash flows, competitive      
position, financial condition and results of operations by significantly        
limiting access to funding or capital markets, increasing borrowing costs or    
triggering increased collateral requirements. Financial services issuers face   
significant legal risk, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, as 
well as private actions. Profit margins of these companies continue to shrink   
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital  
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.            

Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory  
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.        
Technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut        
overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to  
face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial 
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were              
traditionally offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the  
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when    
interest rates change or due to increased competition. Further, economic        
conditions in the real estate market may have a particularly strong effect on   
certain banks and savings associations.                                         

 Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the  
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and 
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely 
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these           
companies.                                                                      

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium   
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, terrorism, weather catastrophes   
or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may  
be exposed to risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect   
from reinsurance carriers. Life and health insurance companies may be affected  
by mortality and morbidity rates, including the effect of epidemics. Insurance  
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the       
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of  
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect       
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability.           

 Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced     
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care,         
hospital management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face  
substantial government regulation and approval procedures.                      

 On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the 
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on  
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a   
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant          
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage 
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible   
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,  
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also        
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,    
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing           
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until    
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and            
significant changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased 
costs and changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict   
the full impact of the Act on the Securities in your Trust.                     

As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose         
legislative action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may   
span a wide range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may       
include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for           
competition in the provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid     
health care plans and additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the      
health care sector. The government could also reduce funding for health care    
related research.                                                               

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product          
obsolescence, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply       
products and the risk that a product will never come to market. The research    
and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are   
substantial. This process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee  
of approval. These companies may have losses and may not offer proposed         
products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new   
drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a company and its     
stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also subject to risks  
of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other litigation.            

Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, 
the ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis 
on outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,    
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers    
and government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible         
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of      
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar          
programs).                                                                      

 Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the       
general state of the economy, intense competition, imposition of import         
controls, volatility in commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuation,   
consolidation, labor relations, domestic and international politics, excess     
capacity and consumer spending trends. Companies in the industrials sector may  
be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and product         
liability claims. Capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by 
overall capital spending and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical        
obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key materials,  
depletion of resources, government regulations, government contracts and        
e-commerce initiatives.                                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, changes in government budget priorities, changes   
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers. Stocks of transportation companies are cyclical and can be       
significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices and insurance costs.    
Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to            
significant government regulation and oversight, which may negatively impact    
their businesses.                                                               

Materials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by 
companies in the materials industry. Companies in the materials sector could be 
adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import        
controls and increased competition. Production of materials often exceeds demand
as a result of overbuilding or economic downturns, leading to poor investment   
returns. Companies in the materials sector are at risk for environmental damage 
and product liability claims. Companies in the materials sector may be adversely
affected by depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations, and    
governmental regulations.                                                       

Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds  
issued by telecommunications companies. This sector is primarily characterized  
by extensive government regulation and intense competition.                     

 Companies in the telecommunications industry allocate significant resources
in efforts to comply with applicable government regulations. Telecommunications 
companies operating in the U.S. must comply with applicable state and federal   
regulations, including those of the Federal Communications Commission. The      
costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive  
required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulatory        
requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications           
companies. Recent industry consolidation trends may lead to increased           
regulation in primary markets. Internationally, telecommunications companies    
may face regulatory challenges such as securing pre-marketing clearance of      
products and prices, which may be arbitrary and unpredictable. U.S. federal and 
state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services  
that a company may offer. U.S. federal legislation governing the                
telecommunications industry may become subject to judicial review and           
additional interpretation, which may adversely affect certain                   
telecommunications issuers.                                                     

The competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector is intense and 
constantly evolving. The products and services of these companies may become    
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails 
to keep pace with technological advances. At the same time, demand for some     
telecommunications services remains weak, as several key markets are            
oversaturated and many customers can choose between several service providers   
and technology platforms. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to 
commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and 
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been          
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating  
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.     
Certain telecommunications companies may be engaged in fierce competition for a 
share of the market of their products and may have higher costs, including      
liabilities associated with the medical, pension and postretirement expenses of 
their workforce, than their competitors. As a result, competitive pressures are 
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility. Moreover,         
continued consolidation in this industry could create integration expenses and  
delay, and consequent management diversion of attention away from ongoing       
operations and related risks, among other factors, could result in the failure  
of these companies to realize expected cost savings or synergies.               

Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies in
the past have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of the             
telecommunications industry. High debt loads that were accumulated during the   
industry growth spurt of the 1990s caught up to the industry, causing debt and  
stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications          
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced         
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the         
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Moreover, some companies have begun the process of   
emerging from bankruptcy and may have reduced levels of debt and other          
competitive advantages over other telecommunications companies. Due to these    
and other factors, the risk level of owning the securities of                   
telecommunications companies remains substantial and may continue to rise.      

  Information Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by information technology companies. These companies include companies   
that are involved in computer and business services, enterprise                 
software/technical software, Internet and computer software, Internet-related   
services, networking and telecommunications equipment, telecommunications       
services, electronics products, server hardware, computer hardware and          
peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductors. These companies
face risks related to rapidly changing technology, rapid product obsolescence,  
cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent new product  
introductions. An unexpected change in technology can have a significant        
negative impact on a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products
or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have a       
negative impact on the company's results. Information technology stocks tend to 
experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements  
about new products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can  
cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price  
and volume fluctuations are unrelated to the operating performance of a company.
This can impact your ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to or greater
than what you paid.                                                             

  Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by energy
companies. Energy companies are subject to legislative or regulatory changes,   
adverse market conditions and/or increased competition affecting the energy     
sector. The prices of the securities of energy companies may fluctuate widely   
due to changes in value and dividend yield, which depend largely on the price   
and supply of energy fuels, international political events relating to oil      
producing countries, energy conservation, the success of exploration projects,  
and tax and other governmental regulatory policies.                             

Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional   
energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves significant      
operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no assurance    
that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically      
recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government regulation,         
including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased costs and  
limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain companies   
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting        
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial        
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.         

 In addition, energy companies face risks related to political conditions in
oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil  
and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, operating     
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political      
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past and     
appear to change on an ongoing basis. Political instability or war in these     
regions could have a negative impact on your investment. Oil and natural gas    
prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC controls a substantial portion of world  
oil production. OPEC may take actions to increase or suppress the price or      
availability of oil. Various domestic and foreign government authorities and    
international cartels also impact these prices. Any substantial decline in these
prices could have an adverse effect on energy companies.                        

Utility Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by    
utility companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries.  
Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and other energy related    
utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties, including:             

o    Risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    Restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    Regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    Coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    Technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    The effects of unusual, unexpected or abnormal local weather     

 o    Maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to
regulatory and other factors;                               

o    The potential impact of natural or manmade disasters;            

 o    Difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    The high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    Difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities;                                          

o    Increased competition; and                                       

o    International politics.                                          

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the bonds and the performance of the 
Trust.                                                                          

   Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal level in
the United States, and many are regulated at the state level as well. The value 
of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation affecting 
the utilities industry can change. This regulation may prevent or delay the     
utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers, which could 
hinder the utility company's ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers   
and could lead to the taking of measures, including the acceleration of         
obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, by its    
creditors against such utility company. Furthermore, regulatory authorities,    
which may be subject to political and other pressures, may not grant future rate
increases, or may impose accounting or operational policies, any of which could 
adversely affect a company's profitability and its stock price.                 

Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial 
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been         
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic       
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit 
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates of
return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business and
may be less profitable. While regulated providers tend to have regulated        
returns, non-regulated providers' returns are not regulated and generally are   
more volatile. These developments have reduced stability of cash flows in those 
states with non-regulated providers and could impact the short-term earnings    
potential of some in this industry. These trends have also made shares of some  
utility companies less sensitive to interest rate changes but more sensitive to 
changes in revenue and earnings and caused them to reduce the ratio of their    
earnings they pay out as dividends.                                             

Certain utilities companies face risks associated with the operation of   
nuclear facilities for electric generation, including, among other              
considerations, litigation, the problems associated with the use of radioactive 
materials and the effects of natural or man-made disasters. In general, certain 
utility companies may face additional regulation and litigation regarding their 
power plant operations, increased costs from new or greater regulation of these 
operations, and expenses related to the purchase of emissions control equipment.

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" and notes 
thereto. This information relates to other characteristics of the bonds. This   
section briefly describes some of these characteristics.                        

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond       
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.  

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type   
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's    
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during 
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be        
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or 
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to    
the First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts        
necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become          
available from interest payments on the related bonds. Also, since interest on  
any "when, as and if issued" bonds does not begin accruing to the benefit of    
Unitholders until the date of delivery, the Trustee may reduce its fee and pay  
Trust expenses in order to maintain or approach the same estimated net annual   
interest income during the first year of the Trust's operations as described    
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information".                             

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   
or any other government agency.                                                 

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return as of the 
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of the prospectus. Estimated Current 
Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per   
Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest income per 
Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and with the     
principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange or sale  
of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the  
bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current    
Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated 
using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors  
in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into      
account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and        
estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and  
sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements   
of the bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance  
that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The 
Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ  
because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated    
date and amount of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return        
calculation includes only net annual interest income and Public Offering        
Price.                                                                          

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account (including cash to pay organization costs) and accrued        
interest, if any. The maximum sales charge for an Intermediate-Term Trust is    
equal to 3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (3.093% of the aggregate   
offering price of the bonds). Organization costs are not included in the Public 
Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales charge. After the 
initial public offering period, the secondary market Public Offering Price is   
based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if
any, in the Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The actual sales    
charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales       
charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the      
Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased. The minimum purchase
in the primary and secondary market is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or      
selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.   

The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the 
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR  
Life") of your Trust's portfolio:                                               

ELTR Life (Years)   Sales Charge

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering     
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a    
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the      
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the        
bonds).                                                                         

Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for  
a reduced sales charge. As further described in this section, purchases         
executed on the same day by a single person at the same broker-dealer may be    
combined for sales charge discount calculation purposes. Secondary market       
purchases are excluded for purposes of sales charge discount calculations.      

Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. Based upon the aggregate dollar amount of Units        
purchased by a Unitholder in the initial offering period, the following table   
shows both the corresponding sales charge and the concession or agency          
commission allowed to broker-dealers and other selling agents on such           
transaction.

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to   
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a      
single broker-dealer. Additional information regarding the broker-dealer        
concession or agency commission is presented in the "Unit Distribution"         
section.                                                                        

Aggregated Purchases-- For purposes of achieving these levels, you may    
combine certain purchases made on the same day through a single broker-dealer   
or selling agent, as further described below. You must inform your              
broker-dealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for 
a reduced sales charge. For purposes of achieving the quantity discount levels  
in the above table, Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus may be combined 
with (i) purchases of units of any other Invesco-sponsored unit investment      
trusts during each trust's initial offering period, (ii) purchases of units     
made as described under the "Fee Accounts" paragraph in this section, and (iii) 
purchases of units eligible for the sales charge discounts described under the  
"Exchanges" paragraph in this section. In addition, Units purchased in the name 
of your spouse (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) or children    
(including step-children) under 21 living in the same household as you will be  
deemed to be additional purchases by you for the purposes of calculating the    
applicable quantity discount level. The reduced sales charge levels will also   
be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single     
trust, estate (including multiple trusts created under a single estate) or      
fiduciary account.                                                              

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the
portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases.    
Units may be purchased in the initial offering period at the Public Offering    
Price less the maximum applicable concession the Sponsor typically allows to    
brokers and dealers (either non-Underwriter or Underwriter concession, whichever
is greater) for purchases by investors who purchase Units through registered    
investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers 
who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial  
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such     
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee Accounts") if   
the Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee
(i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). For example, with respect to an        
Intermediate Term Trust, Wrap Fee Eligible purchasers would pay a sales charge  
of only 0.65%, which represents the maximum sales charge minus the maximum      
applicable concession of 2.35%. The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny 
purchases of Units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms    
whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a Trust. As  
described above in "Large Quantity Purchases", Units purchased for a Fee Account
may be combined with certain other purchases for purposes of achieving the      
quantity discount levels presented in the table above under "Large Quantity
Purchases", however, such Wrap Fee Eligible Units are not eligible for any sales
charge discounts in addition to that which is described in this paragraph and   
under the "Fee Accounts" section found below.                                   

Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit    
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
trusts to purchase Units of an Intermediate-Term Trust, or units of any other   
Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust in its initial offering period, at a    
reduced sales charge. For such purchases of less than $3,000,000, the sales     
charge will be reduced by 1.00% for Units of an Intermediate-Term Trust. For    
purchases of $3,000,000 or more, either made solely with redemption or          
termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts or in combination with   
other purchases as described above under "Large Quantity Purchases",            
Intermediate-Term Trust Units will be eligible for the applicable quantity      
discount level presented in the table that appears in that subsection. For      
aggregated purchases described above in the "Large Quantity Purchases"          
subsection that consist of any units other than Intermediate-Term Trust Units,  
please refer to the prospectus of the applicable Invesco-sponsored unit         
investment trust for information regarding the specified sales charge reductions
on those units. In order to be eligible for the sales charge discounts          
applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or termination proceeds from  
other unit investment trusts, the trade date of each rollover or redemption, or 
each other trust's termination date resulting in the receipt of such proceeds   
used to purchase Units of the Trust must all be derived from transactions that  
occurred within 30 calendar days prior to your Unit purchase. In addition, the  
discounts will only be available for investors that utilize the same            
broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for  
both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the      
termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase. You may be       
required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your      
broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge       
discounts. An exchange does not avoid a taxable event on the redemption or      
termination of an interest in a Trust.                                          

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses (or 
the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or step-children     
under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents and trustees,    
custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively         
referred to herein as "related purchasers")) of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.   
and its affiliates and, when permitted, Underwriters and their affiliates may   
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable underwriting    
commission or less the applicable dealer concession in the absence of an        
underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors (including related   
purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public    
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts    
are subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees,        
officers and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate   
in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.               

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in accordance with    
fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units as of the opening of
business on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales   
charge and organization costs to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and  
dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. This price determination   
was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator.  
During the initial offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the
Evaluation Time on days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and    
will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The "Evaluation     
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that   
the Exchange is open for regular trading, or earlier on days where the Bond     
Market Association recommends an early bond market close, provided, however, on 
the Date of Deposit the Evaluation Time will be the close of regular trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with   
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") becomes effective, if later. 
The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to the        
aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales     
charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary   
market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the       
Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as
necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range approximately   
from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price. The Public Offering Price per    
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on  
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time  
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the          
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time        
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders      
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by       
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received 
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time    
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined  
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor 
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to 
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a   
timely manner.                                                                  

The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the        
appropriate bid prices or offering prices, as described herein, (a) on the      
basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily 
deal in bonds comparable to those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are   
not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c)  
by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the     
practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any   
combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate   
with changes in market interest rates.                                          

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

Organization Costs. During the initial offering period, part of the Public
Offering Price represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the estimated      
costs incurred in establishing your Trust. These costs include the costs of     
preparing documents relating to the Trust (such as the registration statement,  
prospectus, trust agreement and legal documents), federal and state             
registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee and the initial 
audit. Your Trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial   
offering period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will   
decline when the Trust deducts these costs from the Trust assets.               

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although your    
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount  
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with  
respect to sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate    
share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public         
Offering Price of Units. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid   
on your Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued 
interest which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance   
the amount of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of 
the First Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the      
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the      
First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less any distributions from    
the Interest Account after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying    
interest payment dates of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will 
be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your Trust and      
distributed to Unitholders. If you sell or redeem all or a portion of your      
Units, you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued  
interest from the purchaser of your Units.                                      

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states.            

Intermediate-Term Trust Concessions. During the initial offering period, the
Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units of Intermediate-Term Trusts to         
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the applicable gross concession or      
agency commission set forth in the "Broker-Dealer Concession or Agency          
Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales Charge -- Large
Quantity Purchases". These breakpoints will be adjusted to take into            
consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely      
fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be issued.               

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of an Intermediate-Term Trust, the regular concession or agency           
commission allowed by the Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents    
will amount to 1.30% for aggregated purchases of less than $3,000,000. For such 
aggregated purchases of $3,000,000 or more, the regular concession or agency    
commission will correspond to the amounts listed in the "Broker-Dealer          
Concession or Agency Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales
Charge -- Large Quantity Purchases".                                            

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the maximum concession allowed to Underwriters by   
the Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.    

  Following the end of the initial offering period, any broker-dealer or other
selling agent who is not a Qualifying Broker-Dealer (as described below) will   
be entitled to receive an additional per Unit concession based on the following 
table corresponding to the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the   
Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period.                           

Aggregate Number of Units    Additional                                         
Purchased from the Sponsor   Concession                                         
---------------------------------------                                         
250 - 999 Units                 0.10%                                           
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units       0.20%                                           
3,000 Units or more             0.25%                                           

Notwithstanding the concession amounts presented in the "Broker-Dealer    
Concession or Agency Commission" column of the table under "Reducing Your Sales
Charge -- Large Quantity Purchases", broker-dealers and other selling agents    
who have not acted as Underwriters for the Trust that purchase 250 or more      
Units of a Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying           
Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a concession or agency commission on all Units 
of a Trust purchased from the Sponsor throughout the initial offering period    
equal to the regular concession allowed to Underwriters described under         
"Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. Further, Qualifying               
Broker-Dealers not receiving the maximum concession amount per Unit on the Date 
of Deposit may be eligible to receive an additional per Unit concession based   
upon the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the Sponsor as of the   
end of the initial offering period. Qualifying Broker Dealers having purchased  
less than 1,000 Units of the Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit will 
be entitled to an additional concession of 0.10% if the aggregate number of     
Trust Units purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering    
period totals at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 Units, or an additional  
concession of 0.15% for totals of at least 3,000 Units. Qualifying Broker       
Dealers having purchased at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 Units of the  
Trust from the Sponsor on the Date of Deposit will be entitled to an additional 
concession of 0.05% if the aggregate number of Trust Units purchased from the   
Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period totals at least 3,000      
Units.                                                                          

Regarding the additional per Unit concessions described above for both    
Qualifying Broker Dealers and for other broker-dealers or selling agents, these 
additional concessions will also be applied on a dollar basis utilizing an      
equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on whichever basis is more    
favorable to the dealer firm or selling agent. Purchase orders stated in dollars
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued will be subject to the concession amount corresponding to the   
dollar amount of the purchase order, utilizing a $1,000 per Unit equivalent.    

Concessions Based Upon Annual Sales. As described below, broker-dealers and
other selling agents may in certain cases be eligible for additional            
concessions based upon their annual eligible sales of all Invesco fixed income  
and equity unit investment trusts. Eligible sales include all units of any      
Invesco unit investment trust underwritten or purchased directly from Invesco   
during a trust's initial offering period. For purposes of the Volume Concession 
described below, trusts designated as either "Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable      
Income Series" or "Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series" are fixed income      
trusts, and trusts designated as "Invesco Unit Trusts Series" are equity        
trusts.                                                                         

Volume Concession--In addition to the concessions or agency commissions   
described above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including          
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all eligible Invesco unit investment trusts    
during the previous consecutive 12-month period through the end of the most     
recent month. The Volume Concession, as applicable to equity and fixed income   
trust units, is set forth in the following table:

Broker-dealers and other selling firms will not receive the Volume        
Concession on the sale of units purchased in Fee Accounts, however, such sales  
will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level          
breakpoints set forth in the Volume Concession table above. Secondary market    
sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of the Volume     
Concession. Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing     
firms that place orders with Invesco and provide Invesco with information with  
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible dealer 
firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely provide       
clearing services to other broker-dealer firms or firms who place orders        
through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We reserve the right to       
change the amount of the concessions or agency commissions from time to time.   
For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation, the trust's        
prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional compensation.     

Additional Volume Concession Eligibility-- Underwriters, broker-dealers or
other selling firms having achieved $500 million in total eligible sales for the
previous 12 month period through the end of the most recent month are eligible  
to receive an additional volume concession for each Trust Unit underwritten or  
purchased directly from the Sponsor on the initial Date of Deposit equal to the 
difference between the maximum allowable concession described under "Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" and the per Unit concession applicable to each Trust  
Unit underwritten or purchased. Only Units acquired on the Date of Deposit may  
qualify for this additional per Unit volume concession, and Unit acquisitions   
made on subsequent days will be subject to the applicable levels as stated in   
the "Unit Distribution" and "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" sections.    
This additional per Unit volume concession will be payable either at the time   
the Units are acquired or following the end of the initial offering period, at  
the election of the recipient. With respect to any Units for which an           
Underwriter, broker-dealer or other selling firm receives this additional per   
Unit volume concession, such Units will not be eligible for additional per Unit 
concessions described under "Intermediate-Term Trust Concessions."

Additional Information. Certain commercial banks may be making Units      
available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge  
paid by these customers (equal to the agency commission referred to above) is   
retained by or remitted to the banks. Any discount provided to investors will be
borne by the selling dealer or agent. For secondary market transactions, the    
Sponsor will sell Units to broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public      
Offering Price less a concession or agency commission of 80% of the applicable  
sales charge. Dealers other than the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary    
market to other broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the secondary market    
concession allowed to the dealer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary      
herein, in no case shall the total of any concessions, agency commissions and   
any additional compensation allowed or paid to any broker, dealer or other      
distributor of Units with respect to any individual transaction exceed the      
maximum sales charge applicable to Intermediate-Term Trusts. The Sponsor        
reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of
Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers
and others from time to time.                                                   

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to      
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that 
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting".                      

The Sponsor will sell Units of Intermediate-Term Trusts to Underwriters at
the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession per Unit         
underwritten set forth in the following table.

--------------------------------------                                          
250 - 999 Units               2.20%                                             
1,000 Units - 2,999 Units     2.30%

 An Underwriter will be allowed a concession throughout the initial offering
period of a Trust equal to the Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on   
the Date of Deposit for Units subsequently purchased from the Sponsor. At the   
end of the initial offering period, an Underwriter not receiving the maximum    
concession amount per Unit on the Date of Deposit may be eligible to receive an 
additional per Unit concession based upon the aggregate number of Trust Units   
underwritten and subsequently purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the   
initial offering period. Underwriters having underwritten less than 1,000 Units 
of the Trust will be entitled to an additional concession of 0.10% if the       
aggregate number of Trust Units underwritten and subsequently purchased from    
the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering period totals at least 1,000  
Units but less than 3,000 Units, or an additional concession of 0.15% for       
totals of at least 3,000 Units. Underwriters having underwritten at least 1,000 
Units but less than 3,000 Units of the Trust will be entitled to an additional  
concession of 0.05% if the aggregate number of Trust Units underwritten and     
subsequently purchased from the Sponsor as of the end of the initial offering   
period totals at least 3,000 Units.                                             

The concessions for a) Units underwritten on the Date of Deposit, b) Units
purchased from the Sponsor by an Underwriter subsequent to the Date of Deposit  
during a Trust's initial offering period, and c) the additional per Unit        
concession for Underwriters will each also be applied on a dollar basis         
utilizing an equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on whichever     
basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. Purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued will be subject to the concession amount corresponding to the   
stated dollar amount of the purchase order, utilizing a $1,000 per Unit         
equivalent.                                                                     

 Any Underwriter which has achieved $500 million in total eligible sales for
the previous 12 month period through the end of the most recent month will be   
eligible to receive an additional per Unit volume concession as described under 
"Unit Distribution--Concessions Based Upon Annual Sales--Additional Volume      
Concession Eligibility".                                                        

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter          
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, in certain      
instances, the sum of the sales charge discount and the broker-dealer           
concession may exceed the concession allowed to the Underwriter. At the request 
of the Underwriter, the Sponsor may repurchase such Units at the Public         
Offering Price per Unit less the concession amount allowed to the Underwriter   
during the Trust's initial offering period, and subsequently resell those Units 
back to the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price per Unit less the          
applicable sales charge reduction per Unit and broker-dealer concession amounts 
listed in the table found under "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales
Charge--Large Quantity Purchases".                                              

In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio". The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also realize profits or losses 
with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from underwriting      
syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not participated as sole 
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may further realize profit or loss  
during the initial offering period as a result of possible fluctuations in the  
market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units  
(excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will be    
retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of an Underwriter are entitled to the  
same dealer concessions or agency commissions that are available to the         
Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits Underwriters may realize from the
sale of Units, the Sponsor will share with certain Underwriters a portion of any
gain represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor 
and the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit (less deductions for     
accrued interest and certain costs). For Underwriters who either (a) underwrite 
at least 3,000 Units or (b) submit an Underwriter purchase order of at least    
$3,000,000, the Sponsor will share 50% of that portion of the gain that relates 
to the Units actually underwritten by such Underwriters. For those Underwriters 
who either (a) underwrite at least 1,000 Units but less than 3,000 Units or (b) 
submit an Underwriter purchase order of at least $1,000,000 but less than       
$3,000,000, the Sponsor will share 25% of that portion of the gain that relates 
to the Units actually underwritten by such Underwriters. The Sponsor and certain
of the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of  
any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at  
which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for    
Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of    
repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                 

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trust and our 
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and      
offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon    
the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal   
cash on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges 
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A           
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as   
to current market prices in order to determine whether there is any price in    
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Trust is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your          
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these          
accounts. For these purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales   
charge that is retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Invesco Capital Markets, Inc.  
You should consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section    
for specific information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section 
governs the calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the 
right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or       
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental   
to a Trust.                                                                     

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly. The amount and time of   
the first distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". In addition, a Trust that has elected to be structured as a       
"regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional     
required distributions at the end of each year.                                 

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,        
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the       
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be 
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the        
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The 
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or       
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits   
from the use of these funds). Should the amount available for distribution in   
the Principal Account equal or exceed $5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a   
distribution from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date   
to Unitholders of record on the related monthly record date. However, funds in  
the Principal Account will be distributed on the last distribution date of each 
calendar year to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date if the   
amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.          

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on    
the second distribution date after the purchase.                                

Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust   
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day  
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the   
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental     
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem 
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank 
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three         
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an     
amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after 
receipt by the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed   
to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as       
regards Units received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange  
is open and the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on    
that day for redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received   
by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are     
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the        
Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by          
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption      
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until 
after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the   
next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the       
Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial          
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee   
so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling  
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests.      
Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.       

Under Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") regulations, the Trustee is    
required to withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee 
has not received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such 
regulations or if the IRS notifies the Trustee that such withholding is         
required. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by 
the Unitholder only when filing a return or a claim for refund. Under normal    
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "backup withholding".            

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, (iii) accrued interest, less (a)    
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued    
Trust expenses. During the initial offering period, the Redemption Price and    
secondary market repurchase price are not reduced by estimated organization     
costs. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of   
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit Price". Accrued interest paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented   
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When    
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may 
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result   
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                               

The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more 
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in kind    
distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made by the     
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in           
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository  
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be       
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a             
Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind 
distribution.                                                                   

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any    
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full   
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.        

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco   
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. An exchange does not avoid a taxable     
disposition of your redeemed Units. You should contact your financial           
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax          
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will     
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state  
income tax purposes.                                                            

 Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or      
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account   
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units    
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you     
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by  
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in 
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.            

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be      
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the    
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within 
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will        
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a       
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual   
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust        
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the   
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account 
or your Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The        
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.                 

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS                                                          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance may have been obtained prior to the deposit of certain of the   
bonds in your Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal, when 
due, in respect of such bonds. The premium for any preinsured bond insurance    
has been paid by the issuer or by a prior owner of the bonds and any policy is  
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains in business. The preinsured 
bond insurers, if any, are described in "Portfolio" for each Trust and the      
notes thereto. More detailed information regarding insurance on the bonds and   
the preinsured bond insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See     
"Additional Information".                                                       

 Each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the
state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation, however, is no  
guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on its contract of          
insurance in the event a claim should be made. The financial information with   
respect to each insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance           
regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities.  
No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such         
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such            
information subsequent to the dates thereof.                                    

  Bond Insurers. Any downgrade in the rating of an insurer of the bonds in the
Trust may result in a downgrade in the rating of the issuer of the related bond 
and therefore may have a material adverse effect on the value of the bonds in   
the Trust and the value of your Units. The following is a description of the    
various bond insurers:                                                          

ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). On December
15, 2008, S&P withdrew the financial strength, financial enhancement, and       
issuer credit ratings of ACA Financial Guaranty.                                

 Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac"). On November 8, 2010, Ambac Financial
Group, Inc., the holding company of Ambac, announced that it has filed for a    
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy  
Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the      
Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac Financial Group,  
Inc. will continue to operate in the ordinary course of business as             
"debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in    
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders 
of the Bankruptcy Court.                                                        

On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial     
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.  
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of 
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account  
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives, 
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance            
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial        
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.                                             

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance, Inc.        
("FSA")). On July 1, 2009, Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"), the parent        
company of Assured Guaranty, completed the purchase of Financial Security       
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,    
FSA. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed "Assured Municipal." In        
certain states, Assured Municipal may operate under its prior name. Assured     
Municipal, a separately capitalized company, provides municipal bond insurance, 
while Assured Guaranty provides financial guaranty insurance to both the        
municipal and structured finance sectors.                                       

On November 30, 2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial    
strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from     
AA+, with a stable outlook. The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view 
that Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to   
mitigate the largest obligor concentrations for a higher rating. On January 17,
2013, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured    
Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a    
stable outlook. The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of 
the business franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility 
of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal.                                      

Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. ("BHAC"). On April 8, 2009, Moody's    
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1,     
with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects Moody's view concerning "the     
impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe decline in equity markets    
over the past year as well as the protracted economic recession." On February
4, 2010, S&P lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+,     
with a stable outlook, reflecting S&P's view that Berkshire's overall capital   
adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA rating and is   
not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near term.             

Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). On July 23, 2012, S&P     
assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial strength and counterparty   
credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings based upon S&P's view that 
BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low industry risk, along with 
extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating performance.             

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). On November 11, 2009, Moody's
announced that it will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of      
CIFG. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial     
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.                            

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). On March 24, 2009, Moody's 
withdrew the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009,    
S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial         
enhancement ratings of FGIC.                                                    

On November 24, 2009, FGIC announced that pursuant to an order of the New 
York Insurance Department, the company must suspend any and all claims payments 
until it has removed the impairment of its capital and restored to compliance   
its minimum surplus to policyholders requirement.                               

Municipal Assurance Corporation ("MAC"). On March 18, 2014, S&P raised its
financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA- to AA. The rating     
action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position remains strong       
relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to view MAC as having
a stable outlook.                                                               

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")      
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). On February 18,
2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA       
Corp."), announced the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance        
operations following the approval of the New York and Illinois insurance        
regulators. The restructuring involves the segregation of its financial guaranty
insurance operations into two separately capitalized sister companies, with MBIA
Illinois assuming the risk associated with its US municipal exposures, and with 
MBIA Corp. insuring the remainder of the portfolio, including all international 
and structured finance exposures. Business recently ceded to MBIA Corp. from    
FGIC has been assigned to MBIA Illinois. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois       
formally changed its name to National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation.     
National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently 
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Guarantee may operate under its prior name.   

On May 21, 2013, Moody's upgraded National Guarantee's insurance financial
strength rating to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive outlook. On May 10, 2013,    
S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial           
enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BBB, with a stable          
outlook.                                                                        

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). On November 10, 2010, Moody's    
confirmed Radian's Ba1 insurance financial strength rating, with a stable       
outlook. On December 23, 2010, S&P confirmed Radian's BB- financial strength,   
financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings, with a negative outlook.   

 Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial    
strength rating of Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing         
outlook. On July 28, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial      
strength and financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee.                

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The  
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco        
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco  
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net 
worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 11 
Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of March 31, 2015, the total      
stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. was $105,899,086.21       
(unaudited). The current assets under management and supervision by Invesco Ltd.
and its affiliates were valued at approximately $798.3 billion as of March 31,
2015.                                                                           

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report 
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with        
respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional           
information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot perform our duties under 
the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may appoint a new sponsor,  
continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or terminate your Trust and   
distribute the liquidation proceeds.                                            

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company      
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions       
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its         
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial adviser. The 
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New 
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of  
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal        
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding    
the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's 
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger        
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the       
Trustee. See "Additional Information".                                          

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds   
or other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of      
certain legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated   
by the Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The   
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description   
of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria    
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also         
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust       
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and   
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not   
be reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been      
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under    
the Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract    
and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the       
amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement  
Bonds must (i) be intermediate-term bonds, debentures, notes or other straight  
debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether senior or            
subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed maturity  
dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no warrants or 
subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States currency;    
(iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted securities; and   
(iv) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt from the         
reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or indirectly,   
by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services or         
products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the    
payment of the substitute bonds. The Trustee shall notify all Unitholders of a  
Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement Bond and shall    
make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost of the    
Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued interest. If 
Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales charge         
attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and distribute   
the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Bonds to   
the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds within 30  
calendar days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated    
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the   
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially     
adversely affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith   
by the Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to      
increase the number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition  
to or in substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust,      
except for the substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify 
Unitholders of any amendment.                                                   

 Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet     
sold are tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the   
Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the   
time they were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder  
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower       
amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that    
time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon   
termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at 
the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share  
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs, 
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust           
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own    
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of   
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless  
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee   
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under    
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for 
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is  
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations   
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best         
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be     
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in         
judgment.                                                                       

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust as of the date of this prospectus. Tax  
laws and interpretations are subject to change, and this summary does not       
describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, except as   
specifically provided below, this summary generally does not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, financial institution, person who marks to market their      
Units or other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section   
does not describe your alternative minimum, state, local or foreign tax         
consequences. Depending on the terms of certain bond issuances, however, some   
of the bonds in the Trust may be exempt from state and local taxes of the state 
in which such bonds were issued. Please consult with your tax advisor with      
respect to any specific state or local tax consequences.                        

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this      
section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income    
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. Additional            
information on taxes is contained in the Information Supplement.                

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. The Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a     
"regulated investment company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust         
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as       
provided in the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income        
taxes.                                                                          

Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable to you. After the
end of each year, you will receive a tax statement that specifies your amount   
of ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends.                   

  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital      
gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In addition, the Trust 
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions 
from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in   
additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by        
amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require   
you to treat certain distributions made to you in January as if you had         
received them on December 31 of the previous year.                              

A distribution paid by your Trust reduces the Trust's net asset value per 
Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a         
distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would be    
subject to income tax even though it may be viewed, in substance, as a partial  
return of capital.                                                              

Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation 
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received        
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the         
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from  
regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual that  
owns Units generally will not be entitled to treat Trust distributions as       
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates, as  
it is not expected that Trust distributions will be attributable to qualified   
dividend income received by the Trust.                                          

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this     
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the  
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is  
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.   
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you         
purchase your Units.                                                            

Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal  
federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally 20%.       

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after        
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as          
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The 
tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are  
generally the same as for ordinary income.                                      

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax purposes. In general, any 
gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and any loss will be treated   
as capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be       
disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced within a period of 
61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of    
Units or to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or     
enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or   
securities. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to 
reflect the disallowed loss.                                                    

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. In general, this distribution will be treated as a sale for  
federal income tax purposes and you will recognize gain or loss, based on the   
value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received, and       
subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses under the tax     
rules.                                                                          

Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your   
Trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases,    
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as   
income. In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.  
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment          
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these   
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such deductions 
may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain         
levels.                                                                         

Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other 
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax          
treaties, distributions from the Trust will be characterized as dividends for   
federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which the Trust reports as    
capital gain dividends) and will generally be subject to U.S. income taxes,     
including withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions. However             
distributions received by a foreign investor from the Trust that are properly   
reported by the Trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust      
makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met. Distributions     
received by a foreign investor attributable to interest-related dividends of a  
regulated investment company such as the Trust may not be subject to U.S.       
federal income tax withholding. The amount of distributions that may be         
reported as interest-related dividends will be limited to the amount of         
qualified net interest income, which is generally the Trust's U.S.-source       
interest income less allocable expenses.                                        

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross 
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid  
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial   
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due  
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the   
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain  
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under   
FATCA. Pursuant to the rules above and the applicability of any                 
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign 
country, withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with respect to distributions 
from your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after       
January 1, 2017. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to 
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or    
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such      
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to   
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any  
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should       
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual 
circumstances.                                                                  

Backup Withholding. By law, your Trust must withhold as backup withholding a
percentage (currently 28%) of your taxable distributions and redemption         
proceeds if you do not provide your correct social security or taxpayer         
identification number and certify that you are not subject to backup            
withholding, or if the IRS instructs your Trust to do so.                       

Investors Should Consult Their Tax Advisors. Investors in the Trust may be
subject to federal, state, local, or foreign taxes in connection with their     
investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged to consult their own tax      
advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local, and foreign tax          
consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment in the Trust.    

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts, provided that organization 
costs are generally paid out of cash deposited in the Principal Account. The    
Trustee also may withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems 
necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of    
the Trusts. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's    
assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such      
amounts to the appropriate Accounts.                                            

  Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the           
establishment of your Trust. These costs and charges will include the cost of   
the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration    
statement and other documents relating to your Trust, federal and state         
registration fees and costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and  
legal and auditing expenses. The Public Offering Price of Units includes the    
estimated amount of these costs. The Trustee will deduct these expenses from    
your Trust's assets at the end of the initial offering period or after six      
months, if earlier.                                                             

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" for providing bookkeeping    
and administrative services and for providing portfolio supervisory services    
for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these       
services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing these services 
to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total cost of         
providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive the     
annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its services the        
Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" (which may be reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's 
compensation for its services is expected to result from the use of the funds   
being held in the Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions,     
payment of expenses and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest       
bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on the outstanding principal       
amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of   
the close of business on January 1 for each year thereafter. The Sponsor's,     
Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for All    
Urban Consumers or, if this category is not published, in a comparable          
category.                                                                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts        
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any        
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds  
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon            
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for   
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may  
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest     
rates). Each Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration 
statement each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of  
the Trusts. When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee,    
they are secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the     
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for 
amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such 
amounts.

Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor    
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect   
in any of the bonds.                                                            

Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. The Trust may invest 
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell consumer    
products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by various      
factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends.
In the past, there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the 
declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the     
retail industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued       
viability of the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt 
and to compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real   
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in
employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked            
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in          
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely 
affecting consumer spending habits. Increasing employee and retiree benefit     
costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the   
retail industry, competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging 
consumer tastes and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent      
increase in trade opportunities with other countries, American retailers are now
entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of    
foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints   
and added research costs.                                                       

Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds   
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.              

The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007 
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services  
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment    
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact   
of these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and   
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation 
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility   
of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles.     
Many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to   
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity        
capital. In some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide    
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has 
nonetheless increased substantially.                                            

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and      
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with 
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated     
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result 
of these steps.                                                                 

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when    
interest rates change or due to increased competition. As initial home          
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest 
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real
estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone     
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are        
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;    
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the      
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized
and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the      
securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The     
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows banks,    
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial             
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and heightened       
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent years, allowing
banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since  
mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches.         
Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of 
market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market        
accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for  
sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in   
the reported health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to    
correct such problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be     
forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed         
substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws,    
rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any,  
that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's portfolio. In addition,
from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and      
federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that system could, among other      
things, further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks
or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor.    
Such reforms could reduce profitability, as investment opportunities available  
to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings      
vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face significant competition from other
financial institutions such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking    
companies and insurance companies, and increased competition may result from    
legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers. Among
other benefits, such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to     
acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their       
various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter
makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might
ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the    
Trust's portfolio.                                                              

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals, 
if necessary, will be obtained.                                                 

Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition 
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction 
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level  
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could       
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the          
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including  
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive    
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes
in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,           
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.                    

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the      
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in     
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather      
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual   
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come   
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have           
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state        
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company         
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")  
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,  
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws  
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal      
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the       
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. 
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will  
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance         
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.  

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable 
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be       
either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing 
power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific     
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy        
taxes.                                                                          

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment.                                                                        

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and     
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local     
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy    
for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by  
the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in an amount   
equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45       
percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as        
Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds).                                      

  The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the        
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable  
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build      
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the     
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds  
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay       
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a    
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for 
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to 
have this subsection of the Code apply.                                         

Should a Build America Bond issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, it is 
possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,        
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition,
Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event  
that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act)
or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash     
subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs. 

  Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable      
bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and        
municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy   
payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring       
Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18,
2010, permits issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond   
interest payments.                                                              

Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the 
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair 
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a      
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds 
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy        
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction  
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation   
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable
Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that   
produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for        
Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may 
be issued for these bond types.                                                 

Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for   
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and 
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as    
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School          
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of  
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal      
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified 
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy  
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or 
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.       
Treasury.                                                                       

Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it  
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,     
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even      
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section  
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be        
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is   
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to        
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.                

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting               
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate      
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments   
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their   
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient 
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments   
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for       
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the     
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and 
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).    

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number   
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,      
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or       
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or        
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally 
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,         
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of      
subsidies.                                                                      

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates    
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate     
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends   
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from  
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,     
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation 
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of  
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                 

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues  
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand    
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government           
regulation and rate approvals.                                                  

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"   
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount      
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at       
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to   
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market      
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.    

Insurance on the Bonds

Insurance has been obtained by the issuer of bonds or by a prior owner of 
such bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in an Insured Trust guaranteeing  
prompt payment of interest and principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in  
such Insured Trust. See "The Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the       
prospectus. The premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an     
issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any such policy or policies   
are non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured   
are outstanding and the preinsured bond insurer remains in business.            

  Bond Insurers. The following is a description of the various preinsured bond
insurers:                                                                       

  ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December    
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty          
insurance policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.    

On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its       
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that  
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of   
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt         
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with         
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial  
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on        
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.                

As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets
of $436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a       
surplus as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.                             

On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial        
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC, 
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the    
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding 
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly       
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a 
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS        
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA          
Financial Guaranty's request.                                                   

 The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by ACA Financial Guaranty or the rating agencies. No representation   
is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the 
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

  Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in 
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into    
two business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services.     
Ambac provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance  
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a   
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance   
to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating      
expenses.                                                                       

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial     
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,   
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from   
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac   
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's      
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly  
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and      
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk  
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's          
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3  
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected        
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered 
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a 
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance        
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential    
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation     
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively                  
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the   
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's      
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1 
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened        
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its    
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential 
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's    
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to    
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities   
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio  
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,        
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB 
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac     
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and 
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of      
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered 
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings  
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009 
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant         
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and   
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account  
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a 
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause       
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,      
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance   
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as 
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would   
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties 
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed         
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial     
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an 
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to   
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies 
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions. 
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating  
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing    
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial  
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.  
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of 
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account  
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives, 
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance            
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial        
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.                                             

 There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as     
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its         
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of  
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in    
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.               

On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac          
Assurance had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities,  
primarily policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured     
finance transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate    
action is necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In         
conjunction with the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has       
commenced rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in   
the segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or         
settlement of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that  
it had commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO 
of ABS exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.               

On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary    
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern       
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate   
in the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the          
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable      
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac 
Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of      
Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to  
conduct business.                                                               

Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory  
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,           
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December 31,
2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit was   
$3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15      
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the    
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on   
investment securities during the period.

herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the         
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.         
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),  
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance 
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a 
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the     
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.                        

  In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty     
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured  
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront        
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future    
installments related to this transaction.                                       

On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,    
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed       
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal  
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.       

On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its  
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,     
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond    
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of     
both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable      
outlook. The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee  
market, each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the       
quality of each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On    
November 30, 2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength    
ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a  
stable outlook. The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that        
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to        
mitigate the largest obligor concentrations for a higher rating.                

On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's        
updated view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the         
financial guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's           
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3,      
reflecting Moody's view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile      
resulting from its exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in  
the financial guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's     
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 
to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results    
from Moody's review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's     
said that adverse trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on     
Assured's main insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the  
insurance financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured       
Municipal at Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's         
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3   
from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook.   
The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business    
franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured   
Guaranty and Assured Municipal.                                                 

Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit 
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in 
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to the
effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP      
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from       
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned      
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense, 
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,   
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of     
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of    
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and    
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of    
$3.10 billion.

Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available

  Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is       
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.                   

  On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned  
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable  
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength  
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects  
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe 
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic 
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened          
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value             
fluctuations within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4,
2010, S&P lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a 
stable outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of 
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's       
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition    
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's       
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA 
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near     
term.                                                                           

As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of   
$189.1 billion.                                                                 

  The information relating to BHAC and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by BHAC or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as

adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

 Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to 
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and     
began writing policies in September of 2012.                                    

On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial 
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings  
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with    
low industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong      
operating performance.                                                          

  As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards       
policyholders of $491.0 million.                                                

  The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or
the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or     
adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in  
such information subsequent to the date hereof.                                 

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the    
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and          
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,   
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively   
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and 
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered into
a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG (together  
with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").                                  

   On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected     
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business         
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its  
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's 
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative  
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going  
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength   
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high   
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum   
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected         
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a       
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in 
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance        
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,     
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses  
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain  
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the 
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing   
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following 
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of 
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade    
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key          
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged     
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were 
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral. 
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and  
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,   
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured 
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves 
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's         
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3 to Caa2,   
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured     
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On     
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings  
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it   
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's  
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile   
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.          

  As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8    
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease   
is primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is         
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of  
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of         
approximately $3.5 million.                                                     

  The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been

adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned     
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of      
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement    
for public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC    
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or        
additional risks.                                                               

The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global 
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued   
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's        
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the      
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS      
CDOs, which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS,         
primarily backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have      
resulted in a substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus  
over time. On November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the   
predecessor to the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an   
order pursuant to Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, 
among other things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently    
unable to eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an     
out-of-court Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky,    
Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York (the              
"Superintendent") filed a verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State 
of New York for an order of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as 
rehabilitator ("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to    
take possession of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business  
thereof, and (iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the        
removal of the causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation      
proceeding (the "Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the   
commencement of the Rehabilitation Proceeding.                                  

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated  
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").      
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's       
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are    
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and           
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch      
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch  
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had      
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On   
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of    
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility 
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's    
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its        
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative     
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to      
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19,
2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from   
B1 to Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher   
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the           
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On      
March 24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of   
FGIC from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation 
of higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,        
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected      
loss, and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding 
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial       
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty        
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC     
from CCC, with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the     
ratings on FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC 
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive         
financial information will no longer be available.                              

  As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.                    

 On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in    
the Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or   
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.

Municipal Assurance Corporation ("MAC"). MAC is a New York domiciled      
corporation providing municipal bond insurance for municipal and infrastructure 
bonds. MAC currently guarantees only public finance transactions. MAC is an     
Assured Guaranty company owned jointly by its affiliates Assured Guaranty       
Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp. MAC is part of the Assured Guaranty  
Group.                                                                          

On July 17, 2013, S&P assigned MAC a long-term financial strength and     
counterparty credit rating of AA- to MAC with a stable outlook. On March 18,
2014, S&P raised its financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA-  
to AA. The rating action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position    
remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to    
view MAC as having a stable outlook.                                            

As of June 30, 2014, MAC had a total net admitted assets of $1,519,869,768
and total liabilities of $999,277,625 resulting in a surplus as regards         
policyholders of $520,592,143.                                                  

The information relating to MAC contained above is based upon publicly    
available information or upon information that has been provided by the ratings 
agencies. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of    
such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")      
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a    
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through      
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."), 
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial    
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance   
guarantees.                                                                     

On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp.,       
announced the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations      
following the approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The   
restructuring involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance      
operations into two separately capitalized sister companies, with National      
Guarantee assuming the risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and   
with MBIA Corp. insuring the remainder of the portfolio, including all          
international and structured finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp.    
from FGIC in 2008 has been assigned to National Guarantee. To provide           
additional protection for its municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee  
has also issued second-to-pay policies for the benefit of the policyholders     
covered by the reinsurance and assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which    
are a direct obligation of National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New  
York Mellon as insurance trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or  
FGIC, as applicable, do not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the        
policyholders will then be able to make a claim directly against National       
Guarantee under the second-to-pay policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois    
formally changed its name to National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation.     
Effective December 1, 2009, National Guarantee was redomesticated to the State  
of New York and is subject to insurance regulations and supervision of the      
State of New York. National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA,     
Inc. and independently capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources 
as of December 31, 2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee   
Corporation may operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of           
Illinois.                                                                       

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength 
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance       
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa  
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance          
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired     
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured      
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the   
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a       
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its    
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial    
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and      
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.  
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial 
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk      
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the       
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its         
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of 
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress       
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on        
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and 
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative    
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view  
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity  
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005-2007   
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to  
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the    
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business     
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,    
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from 
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss       
assumptions on its 2005-2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in 
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P    
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising       
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with 
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial 
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,       
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook. On      
December 19, 2011 Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
National Guarantee from Baa1 to Baa2, with a negative outlook, based upon       
weakening of the overall MBIA group's market standing as losses grow at National
Guarantee's affiliated companies and the risk that resources at National        
Guarantee could be drawn away to support losses elsewhere within the group. On  
May 10, 2013 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and        
financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BB, with a stable 
outlook. The May 10, 2013 rating action reflects S&P's view that MBIA Corp. no  
longer acts as an anchor on the National Guarantee rating following the         
settlement with Societe Generale that ends litigation challenging National      
Guarantee's split from MBIA Corp. in 2009. On May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the 
insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp. to B3 from Caa2, with a       
positive outlook, citing MBIA Corp.'s improved capital and liquidity profile    
following settlements of putback receivables and insured claims with major      
counterparties. Also on May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the insurance financial   
strength rating of National Guarantee to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive        
outlook. The May 21, 2013 rating action reflects National Guarantee's improved  
credit profile following the repayment of the loan from its weaker affiliate,   
MBIA Corp., and the termination of the litigation related to the 2009           
restructuring.                                                                  

As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets
of $5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus   
as regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.                                        

As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets
of $22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total     
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from 
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.                                           

  The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

  Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group"),
headquartered in Philadelphia, provides private mortgage insurance and related  
risk mitigation products and services to mortgage lenders nationwide through    
its principal operating subsidiary, Radian Guaranty Inc. ("Radian Guaranty").   
Radian, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Guaranty, is domiciled and licensed 
in New York as a financial guaranty insurer. In the third quarter of 2008,      
Radian discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business, including      
accepting reinsurance.                                                          

On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength    
rating of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 
to Ba1, with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the  
credit profile of Radian Guaranty, coupled with increased loss estimates on     
Radian's pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the      
financial strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of      
Radian to BB from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative        
implications, reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's   
insured portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in    
further losses. On December 22, 2009, S&P lowered the financial strength,       
financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB- from BB,   
with a negative outlook.                                                        

  As of September 30, 2012, Radian Group had total assets of $6.45 billion and
total liabilities of $5.43 billion. As of September 30, 2012, Radian had a      
statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.02 billion and a contingency reserve of  
$290.9 million.                                                                 

The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has 
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the         
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

 Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora Holdings
Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee insurance
company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to the public 
finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States and         
internationally.                                                                

In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength     
ratings of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the        
insurance financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's    
severely impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory     
capital requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On  
October 24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
Syncora Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its        
insurance financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with    
developing expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the    
Syncora Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow       
progress in its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On 
January 29, 2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings  
of Syncora Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29,
2009 downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange     
criteria. On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a    
result of the large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora 
Guarantee on its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which    
have resulted in a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of    
December 31, 2008. On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and    
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer      
rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial       
condition). Also on April 27, 2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating  
of Syncora Guarantee to D from CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay 
one or more of its financial obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27,
2009 rating actions resulted from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that         
pursuant to an order of the New York Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company 
must suspend any and all claims payments until it has restored its              
policyholders' surplus to a level greater than or equal to $65 million, the     
minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010, S&P withdrew the D counterparty   
credit rating and the R financial strength and financial enhancement ratings of 
Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings actions resulted from S&P's      
belief that there is not sufficient information to judge Syncora Guarantee's    
claims paying ability.                                                          

As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17     
billion and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders'    
surplus of $504.2 million.                                                      

On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has   
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory         
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and    
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced 
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued  
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the   
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments  
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after  
July 21, 2010.

Portfolio Administration

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units      
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish.    
The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose   
of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                 

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution    
for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the       
Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take   
any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the 
issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of 
the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the   
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted          
therefor. Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement
Bonds" in the prospectus regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for    
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs 
and no provision for payment is made therefor within 30 days, the Trustee is    
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted Bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

information will be made available by the Sponsor upon request.)                

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report 
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust.                                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee Information 

 The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit        
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to 
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New  
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent          
permitted by law.                                                               

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.   
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all     
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such   
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any          
applicable state or federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is         
required to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement  
on file in its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during   
the usual business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the 
bonds held in the Trusts.                                                       

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

Taxation

The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax   
issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion, is     
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion and is not intended to be
a complete discussion of all material tax consequences that might apply to an   
investor in the Trust. Prospective investors should consult their own tax       
advisors with regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership,
or disposition of Trust Units, as well as the tax consequences arising under the
laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. country, or other taxing jurisdiction.    

The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based on the
Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, case law and rulings and     
announcements by the Internal Revenue Service, and in part on the advice of     
counsel to your Trust. The laws on which such advice of counsel is based are    
subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. The Internal Revenue       
Service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In  
addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income tax treatment  
of the assets to be held by your Trust.                                         

   Your Trust intends to elect and to qualify annually as a regulated investment
company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and to 
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its Unitholders. If the   
Trust does not qualify as a regulated investment company, it will be taxed as a 
regular corpration.                                                             

To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally  
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other        
things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from   
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from   
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or     
other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,   
securities or currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded           
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of 
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is 
represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government     
securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other    
securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for  
the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value  
of the Trust's total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting  
securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total 
assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or  
the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or   
two or more issuers which the Trust controls (by owning 20% or more of such     
issuer's outstanding voting securities) and which are engaged in the same,      
similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of qualified         
publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment 
company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest  
and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but  
excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt       
interest income, if any, each taxable year.                                     

 As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. Your Trust
intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually, substantially all  
of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your Trust    
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital 
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed or taxed during those years. To    
prevent application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its           
distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement.    
Further, if your Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may designate the
retained amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who,  
if subject to federal income tax on long-term capital gains, (i) will be        
required to include in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term     
capital gain, their share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be        
entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust       
against their federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to   
the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will be treated  
as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is declared by your   
Trust in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and   
paid by your Trust during January of the following calendar year. These         
distributions will be taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year in which the  
distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the          
distributions are received.                                                     

 If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust      
would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such   
income were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of        
earnings and profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend         
income.                                                                         

 Your Trust may be required to withhold as backup withholding federal income
tax at the backup withholding rate on all taxable distributions payable to you  
if you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number or to make   
required certifications, or if you have been notified by the IRS that you are   
subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any 
amounts withheld may be credited against your federal income tax liability if   
you provide the required information or certification.                          

 A 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on the investment income of taxpayers in the
higher income brackets, which includes dividends and capital gains with respect 
to your Units in the Trust.                                                     

Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are encouraged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal, state, local, 
and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of an investment  
in the Trust. The Trust may make taxable distributions to you even during       
periods in which the value of Units has declined.                               

Termination of the Trust Agreement

  A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient  
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the        
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but   
in no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth 
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust, a Laddered 
Trust or a 10-20 Year Trust, and at the end of the calendar year prior to the   
twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term      
Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, written notice thereof will be   
sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his address appearing on the          
registration books of the Trust maintained by the Trustee. Within a reasonable  
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation   
of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve   
to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges.   
The sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than 
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts.     
With such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution  
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same        
manner.                                                                         

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the      
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This 
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.    

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to  
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as  
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.                       

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current         
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from      
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an      
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on        
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or    
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or 
based on other circumstances.                                                   

 The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:                                                

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
          the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As  
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in  
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or   
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

  AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in         
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is       
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's    
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's      
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues  
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate  
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers
and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal long-term rating 
scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.                      

Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors     
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt        
levels, governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated             
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the      
municipality's ability to repay its debt.                                       

 Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness   
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

  A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

  Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are  
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an        
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a      
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both 
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of       
default.                                                                        

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with  
minimal credit risk.                                                            

  Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.                                                           

 A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.                                                                

Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are  
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative             
characteristics.                                                                

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

  Fitch Ratings. Long-Term Ratings Scales. Fitch rated entities in a number of
sectors, including financial and non-financial corporations, sovereigns and     
insurance companies, are generally assigned Issuer Default Ratings ("IDRs").    
IDRs opine on an entity's relative vulnerability to default on financial        
obligations. The "threshold" default risk addressed by the IDR is generally that
of the financial obligations whose non-payment would best reflect the uncured   
failure of that entity. As such, IDRs also address relative vulnerability to    
bankruptcy, administrative receivership or similar concepts, although the agency
recognizes that issuers may also make pre-emptive and therefore voluntary use of
such mechanisms.                                                                

In aggregate, IDRs provide an ordinal ranking of issuers based on the     
agency's view of their relative vulnerability to default, rather than a         
prediction of a specific percentage likelihood of default. For historical       
information on the default experience of Fitch-rated issuers, please consult the
transition and default performance studies available from the Fitch Ratings     
website.                                                                        

     o    The ratings do not predict a specific percentage of default likelihood
over any given time period;                                 

o    The ratings do not opine on the market value of any issuer's     
      securities or stock, or the likelihood that this value may change;

   o    The ratings do not opine on the liquidity of the issuer's securities
or stock;                                                   

o    The ratings do not opine on the possible loss severity on an     
obligation should an issuer default;                        

o    The ratings do not opine on the suitability of an issuer as a    
counterparty to trade credit;                               

o    The ratings do not opine on any quality related to an issuer's   
      business, operational or financial profile other than the agency's
opinion on its relative vulnerability to default;           

AAA--'AAA' ratings denote the lowest expectation of default risk. They are
assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial
commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by       
foreseeable events.                                                             

  AA--'AA' ratings denote expectations of very low default risk. They indicate
very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not 
significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.                                 

A--'A' ratings denote expectations of low default risk. The capacity for  
payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may,       
nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than
is the case for higher ratings.                                                 

 BBB--'BBB' ratings indicate that expectations of default risk are currently
low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate   
but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this      
capacity.                                                                       

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to denote relative   
status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the 'AAA' 
Long-Term IDR category, or to Long-Term IDR categories below 'B'.               

Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders 

The table below sets forth the per Unit estimated monthly distributions of
interest and principal to Unitholders. The table assumes no changes in          
expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges, redemptions,  
sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or expected      
retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected          
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Investment Trusts
Here today. Here tomorrow.


Having helped many thousands of investors, we’re confident that with the right management, stock market investments have the potential to offer strong, long-term rewards. Investing your money within an investment trust – a closed ended investment company listed on the London Stock Exchange - can be an effective way, over the long-term, to enjoy the growth potential of the stock market.


At Invesco Perpetual we manage a range of nine investment trusts. These vary from the relatively new to having over 125 years’ history, but at the heart of each one is the same commitment to investment excellence. Each of the trusts is diligently managed with long-term performance in mind, based on an active, high conviction approach to investing. 




"I strongly believe the best way to invest in companies is to take a long-term approach and act as much as possible as an owner of a part of a company, rather than as a speculator in share prices"
- Ciaran Mallon,  UK Equities Fund Manager

Managed by Mark Barnett, the Company invests primarily in UK securities with the long-term objective of achieving an increase of the Net Asset Value per share by more than the growth in the FTSE All-Share Index; and growth in dividends per share by more than the rate of UK inflation.

Important information
The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested. 
When making an investment in an investment trust or investment company you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust or investment company may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares. 
Current tax levels and reliefs may change. Depending on individual circumstances, this may affect investment returns. 
Where Invesco Perpetual has expressed views and opinions, these may change. 
The investment trusts and investment companies may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trusts’ and investment companies’ assets are rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trusts and investment companies may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns. 
The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc, Invesco Asia Trust plc, Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc, Keystone Investment Trust plc and Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust plc may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trusts may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved.
Invesco Income Growth Trust plc may, subject to Board approval, invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trust may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. At present the Directors have not sanctioned the use of any derivatives. 
As the Invesco Asia Trust plc is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise. 
As the Invesco Perpetual UK Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc is a smaller companies investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate. 
The City Merchants High Yield Trust Limited and Invesco Perpetual Enhanced Income Limited have a significant proportion of high-yielding bonds, which means that there is more risk to investors’ capital and income than from a Company investing in government or investment grade bonds. Income from the investment may fluctuate and is not guaranteed. The Companies may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the Companies may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved. 
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc may use derivatives for the purpose of efficient portfolio management. There may not be a precise correlation between price movements in the underlying securities, currency or index, on the one hand, and price movements in the investments, which are the subject of the hedge, on the other. In addition, an active market may not exist for a particular derivative instrument at any particular time.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Global Equity Income portfolio may invest in emerging market securities. Investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate, as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will make significant use of financial derivatives (complex instruments) which will result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust. Leverage created from borrowing on certain types of transactions including derivatives may impair the investment trust liquidity, cause it to liquidate positions at unfavourable times or otherwise cause the investment trust not to achieve its intended objective. Leverage occurs when the economic exposure created by the use of derivatives is greater than the amount invested resulting in the investment trust being exposed to a greater loss than the initial investment.
The Invesco Perpetual Select Trust plc Balanced Risk portfolio will gain exposure to commodities which are generally considered to be high risk investments and may result in large fluctuations in the value of the investment trust.
The Directors intend that each portfolio will effectively operate as if it were a stand-alone company. However, prospective investors should be aware that in the event that any of the portfolios have insufficient funds or assets to meet all of its liabilities, such a shortfall would become a liability of the other portfolios. In addition, should the investment trust incur material liabilities in the future, a significant fall in the value of the investment trust’s assets as a whole may affect the investment trust’s ability to pay dividends on a particular class of Shares, even though there are distributable profits attributable to the relevant portfolio.
The investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust’s assets is rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns.
The investment trust expects to increase dividend payments on the Global Equity Income and UK Equity shares by making use of its ability to distribute capital. To the extent the investment trust uses its ability to fund dividends using capital profit this will reduce capital growth.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.
