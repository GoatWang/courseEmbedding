          Experimental: Single arm, NeuroTronik CANS Therapy System
        

                      Device: NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ System
The NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ System is a percutaneous, catheter-based, bedside electrical stimulation system. The System consists of the single-use, disposable NeuroCatheter™ and NeuroCatheter™ Placement Kit, along with the reusable, bedside NeuroModulator™ Development System, and the NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ Cable.







Detailed Description:
A single-arm, safety study intended to assess safety and system performance, and the feasibility to improve hemodynamics in patients with acute heart failure syndrome using transvenous, cardiac autonomic nerve stimulation (CANS) therapy. In addition, the effects of NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ on the congestion of patients will be studied. The study proposes that the NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ System be deployed during the acute heart failure syndrome hospital admission, along with existing standard treatment.
