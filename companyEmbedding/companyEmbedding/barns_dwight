Inclusion & Diversity

Overview



Dwight Howard was a high school phenomenon who soared head and shoulders above all other players to become the number-one draft pick in 2004. Since joining the Orlando Magic, Howard has powered the team to its first NBA Finals in more than a decade. He's an absolute monster on the boards. And in 2009 won the coveted Defensive Player of the Year award-before he was even twenty-five years old! With plenty of seasons still ahead of him, there's no telling how high Dwight Howard will soar. If you want a close look at one of basketball's superstars, look no further! All the stats, quotes, and action are here, plus photos and career highlights. And because it comes from Matt Christopher, readers know they're getting the best sports writing on the shelf.

Editorial Reviews


Wired.com  - Katie M. Palmer
“…photographer Dwight Eschliman captured some of the most common ingredients included in supermarkets’ many, many processed foods… science writer Steve Ettlinger dissects those details, exploring each ingredient’s journey from raw material to highly refined ingredient to your plate.”

Mental Floss  - Shaunacy Ferro
“Eschliman’s images put common ingredients like corn syrup, chlorophyll, MSG, caramel color, and folic acid in the spotlight for once, instead of relegating them to a behind-the-scenes role.”

Fast Company & Inc.
“…a simple exploration of ingredients that most of us know nothing about, even if we're eating them on a regular basis.”

GOOD
“Dwight Eschliman and author Steve Ettlinger present a peek behind the matrix for an unfiltered glimpse at the real ingredients that processed foods are cooked manufactured with. “

NPR ‘The Salt”
“Photographer Dwight Eschliman and writer Steve Ettlinger, seeks to demystify 75 common food additives—their curiosity about additives comes through on every page. Each photo gives a rich sense of the additive's color and texture, and the text regularly throws in additive trivia.”

mental_floss  - Priyanka Mattoo
"Whether or not you want them on your plate, these Ingredients prove a feast for the eyes and mind.”

New York Times Book Review  - Cree LaFavour
"This book belongs in the library of everyone who cares about what goes into their food."
