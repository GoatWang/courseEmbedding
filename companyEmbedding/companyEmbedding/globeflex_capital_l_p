                the following resource teams at GRI:












Data Analysts 
 Finding information on global companies not currently
                                            followed by other investment analysts is challenging. Our team combs through
                                            individual financial statements, often translating, cleaning, and
                                            interpreting language, data, and nuance, in order to build detailed and
                                            accurate financial information on emerging growth companies. In addition,
                                            the team will often work with new or emerging data sources to test and
                                            interpret newly available data. Our data analyst teams understand the
                                            challenges of collecting and standardizing data and act as a formidable beta
                                            tester for new information providers.
                                        















Fundamental Analysts
 Going from raw data to actually creating insight is the
                                            expertise of our fundamental analyst team.
                                            This team is broken into specific sector teams, with audit support, to
                                            generate comprehensive financial models on unfollowed emerging growth
                                            companies. By arranging this team into global sectors, individuals can
                                            harness both local and global business dynamics at the industry level.
                                            Blending common model inputs, such as a common price of oil, sets an
                                            appropriate level playing field for all companies,
                                            while allowing for company specific flexibility and interpretation. The
                                            results of this effort are clean, insightful, and timely models on nearly
                                            1000 global emerging growth companies.

                                            modelling, portfolio performance interpretation and back testing the
                                            strategies across longer timeframes. Ever evolving tools, techniques and
                                            insights are then used to validate model within various market conditions.

Bob Anslow is Partner and Chief Investment Officer of GlobeFlex Capital LP, parent of GlobeFlex
                    Research India Pvt. Ltd.
                
Portfolio management at GlobeFlex has evolved into an adaptable process
                    that is ready to address radically different market environments. We've learned to embrace reform
                    while preserving our strengths. We know that just because a process has worked and you've benefited
                    from it, you've got to challenge everything that you're doing today and do that again tomorrow, and
                    again the next day and again the day after that - to keep challenging the embedded process and be
                    open to thoroughly researched enhancements, if warranted.
Knowing is one thing; having the wherewithal is another. As a research-driven firm, we emphasize
                    upgrading skill through finding good people and efficiency via a faster technology platform to speed
                    up our ability to dissect portfolios and analyze attribution.
And the investment effort is not just six people. We leverage skill by having a constant press of
                    specialist data vendors working on specific projects. One night I totaled up the people who for sure
                    were working on GlobeFlex projects the majority of that day and it was over 100.
At GlobeFlex we stay alert to unintended bets to minimize risk, and are adaptable to enhancing our
                    portfolio construction. We increased the efficacy of our stock selection through creating
                    sector-specific models and also tightened portfolio construction. The modifications on the alpha
                    side weren't just to pull in better short-term performance (although during the recent speculative
                    market environment, better short-term performance would have been welcome); rather, we were
                    upgrading our skill level for the long term.
We'll always be fundamental stockpickers. We'll always be systematic in our approach. And we'll
                    always be a focused, active, research-oriented manager. But we also will always be flexible, because
                    markets are never going to be so stable that you can figure it out once and for all. Your process
                    has to be constantly evolutionary.

 Marina Marrelli is Partner and Chief Executive Officer of GlobeFlex Capital LP, parent of GlobeFlex
                    Research India Pvt. Ltd.
                

                    We are a tight-knit team of experts, and we want to keep it that way. A focused institutional
                    boutique can be pro-active in protecting its environment and since every incoming personality
                    changes the organism, we carefully choose. We get a lot of resumes from incredibly bright, talented,
                    driven people, but we need individuals who really want to be part of a team and understand what that
                    means in terms of mutual learning and mutual respect and mutual teaching. Our culture calls for lots
                    of multi-tasking and the roles are more blurred than in a large firm. It's not for everyone.
In addition to hiring the right people, its giving people enough freedom in their positions to own
                    their jobs, which brings with it complete accountability. You have authority, you have
                    responsibility, and you have accountability. We've built a web of inter-accountability. It's not
                    just one-on-one; it's accountability to the team, to the specific project group you're working
                    with.
People here are given unlimited upside potential. The greatest gratification comes from feeling that
                    all your efforts and talents directly affect the bottom line, that you are positively regarded and
                    that you are respected for your skill set. There's no ceiling.
We add the right people when necessary, but to keep the human component as focused as possible we are
                    also very focused on technology. Consultants and others are always surprised that a privately owned
                    firm of our size has built the sorts of resources we've built. Not only do we have a research
                    platform that serves as a portfolio management laboratory, testing any investment concept we can
                    conceive of, we also have a straight-through processing that brings enormous efficiency.
Here the client is boss, in every form of the word. We are oriented toward collaboration, internally
                    and externally. So we tend to attract clients who are more analytic and who view their managers more
                    as a resource. Their requests for information are a source of learning. It would be easier to be
                    less responsive, to have more mass appeal. But that doesn't fit our personality. If you want to keep
                    being mentally challenged, if you want to keep pushing the research envelope, this is the best way
                    to do it. 










Venkat S. Chalasani, CFA
Director

×




Venkat Chalasani is Director of GlobeFlex India at GlobeFlex Capital LP, parent of
                    GlobeFlex Research India Pvt. Ltd.
                

                    Venkat Chalasani joined the GlobeFlex team July 1, 2015, after having been the Co-Founder and
                    President of Virtua Research since 2004. With primary responsibility for the operation of GlobeFlex
                    Research India Pvt. Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the Boston office, Venkat leads a
                    team of 100 analysts covering more than 1,000 companies in 27 countries. This “first of its kind”
                    modeling
                    platform compiles fundamental research ensuring consistency across all companies regarding their
                    operational drivers, thus circumventing the “lone wolf” process and pitfalls of traditional
                    fundamental research.
GlobeFlex and Virtua first began doing business in 2005, as Bob Anslow recognized the benefit of an
                    India-based fundamental effort to cover companies around the globe that have no or sparse analyst
                    coverage, a classic quantitative blind spot. Venkat and his partners assembled equity analysts, data
                    gatherers, and technology expertise to build what is now a thriving 100-person effort. As of 2010,
                    Virtua provided GlobeFlex the ability to integrate financial statements, proprietary earnings
                    estimates, and other insights into our investment universe, expanding our universe of investment
                    opportunities for all clients. In 2014 we began the process of acquiring the part of Virtua’s
                    business that provides those capabilities and in July 2015, we finished establishing our subsidiary
                    under Indian law and welcomed Venkat’s India-based team into the GlobeFlex family.
Venkat began his career at State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) while earning his MBA at Boston
                    College, securing one of two coveted Executive Fellow spots, a position created in a strategic
                    partnership between the two institutions. There he worked with portfolio managers running an
                    industry rotation equity strategy. Upon completion of his Master’s Degree, he joined the firm full
                    time as a Principal, Portfolio Management, where he constructed a long/short strategy and acted as
                    Assistant Portfolio Manager for Global Equity, International Growth, and Concentrated Socially
                    Responsible Equity.
In addition, he conducted research and had portfolio construction responsibilities. During his four
                    years at SSgA, Venkat spanned several roles, culminating as Principal, Portfolio Management and Head
                    of Global
                    Equity Products, serving as Lead Portfolio Manager for $1 billion in Global Equity portfolios and a
                    U.S. Large Cap mutual fund.
Spreading his entrepreneurial wings in 2001, Venkat left SSgA to join a former boss as a Partner and
                    Portfolio Manager at Concordia Capital Associates, running long/short fundamental equity, primarily
                    in the technology, telecommunications, and health care sectors for three years. 
From there, Venkat found the way to leverage his unique position – the confluence of academic parents
                    involved with India’s top universities and well-educated labor pool, knowledge of the needs of U.S.
                    financial institutions, and the entrepreneurial drive to co-found and build Virtua, the research
                    operations of which are, now GlobeFlex Research India Pvt. Ltd.
Venkat received his Bachelor of Technology with Honors from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)
                    in Kharagpur, India. He earned his MBA from the Boston College Graduate School of Management in
                    1998,
                    and his Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 2000.

Client Testimonials


Evan Fire, Pzena Investment Management At this point, I would say that 98% of accounts are receiving automated feeds…Anytime you can minimize the human touch and allow a computer to say that it has matched 40 out of 50 transactions, and you only have to look at 10 things to figure out what might be an issue, you’re going to minimize the human error component.
Evan Fire, Pzena Investment Management 















Tammy L. Johnson, Globeflex Capital L.P.We’ve now been a client for over 11 years and the relationship remains strong. Electra keeps us well informed, continuously innovating and adding functionality.  Electra provides information on the latest versions which allows us to take advantage of the latest enhancements as our business requirements change and evolve.
Tammy L. Johnson, Globeflex Capital L.P.















Matthew Baglio, AQRWhen you have a technology platform where you can reduce the operational cost, you’re able to reallocate those bodies that were focusing on reconciliations to do different functions outside of recons.
Matthew Baglio, AQR















Todd Healy, BMO Global Asset ManagementIn our new business process, we don’t have to focus on who the custodian is. We simply work with Electra.  They’ve already got interfaces with literally hundreds of custodians whose data they can add to the daily files we’re receiving from them. We’re not having to program and develop an interface for every single custodian that comes onboard, we simply rely on Electra to normalize that data and send it to us in a consistent format.
Todd Healy, BMO Global Asset Management
