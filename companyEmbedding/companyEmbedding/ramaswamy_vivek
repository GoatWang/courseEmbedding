Axovant Sciences Ltd. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company that develops small molecule drugs to treat neurological disorders. The company is legally incorporated in Bermuda, but has headquarters in London, along with secondary offices in Basel, Switzerland and New York City and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.[1] The company was founded by former hedge fund manager Vivek Ramaswamy[2] in 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Roivant Sciences.[3]
It held its IPO in 2015 and raised $315 million.[4] Biotech analysts John Carroll of FierceBiotech and Adam Feuerstein of The Street noted that the IPO was overvalued based on the inexperience of the CEO and the low quality of its lead product, describing it as something that "GSK sold for lunch money".[5][6]
As of 2015 the company's most advanced drug candidate was intepirdine, a potential add-on treatment to donepezil for patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.[4][2][7] Axovant acquired this molecule from GlaxoSmithKline in December 2014.[8]
As of 2016 Axovant was also developing a second compound, nelotanserin. Axovant acquired global rights to nelotanserin from its former parent, Roivant, which had previously bought those rights from Arena Pharmaceuticals.[7] As of 2016 Axovant was developing it as a treatment for Lewy body dementia[9]
In 2016 Axovant partnered with NFL broadcaster Solomon Wilcots to raise awareness of Alzheimer's clinical trails[10][11] That year it also sponsored performances in several U.S cities of “Forget Me Not,” a play by Garrett Davis about an African American family coping with Alzheimer’s disease,[10] in order to raise awareness of its clinical trials in that community, because African Americans are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease as white Americans, but have been historically underrepresented in clinical research studies.[12]
Also in 2016, Axovant partnered with the mobile rideshare service Lyft to transport patients in Alzheimer's disease studies to clinical facilities.[13]
In 2017 David Hung joined the company as CEO.[14]

A 29-year-old former Wall Streeter bought an Alzheimer's drug that failed clinical trials — and now his company is worth $3 billion

  A company owned by former hedge fund manager Vivek Ramaswamy
  recently snatched up the rights to an unnamed dementia drug — the
  same drug that pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline gave up on
  after spending years testing it.

  Since dropping $5 million on the drug, which Glaxo referred to
  simply as SB-742457, a few months ago, Ramaswamy's company,
  Axovant Sciences, now has a
  market value approaching $3 billion, 
  the New York Times reports.

  The company's initial public stock offering last week ranks as
  the biggest ever in the biotechnology industry, 
  according to Forbes.

  The reason Glaxo likely gave up on the drug is simple: It didn't
  appear to work, at least not when used alone.

  After testing it for months in more than a dozen clinical trials,
  the drug showed no effects when given to people alone. But in one
  trial, when it was given to people along with a widely used drug
  called Aricept (which is prescribed to treat some of the symptoms
  of Alzheimer's disease, such as confusion and memory loss), they
  showed a slower loss over time of some measures of brain
  functioning and daily capabilities than those who only took the
  Aricept, 
  the Times reports.





  Ramaswamy took that trial and ran with it.

  "We think we have a great drug candidate,” 
  Ramaswamy told Forbes. "If this drug is approved we think
  it's going to make a huge difference for a lot of patients and
  ultimately there is a huge need and a great team here to do it."

  The new drug, which Ramaswamy's company is calling RVT-101, would
  be taken once a day, and, 
  according to Forbes' Matthew Herper and Nathan Vardi,
  "doesn't seem to cause onerous side effects."

  RVT-101 has been tested in 13 clinical trials so far. In one of
  them, a 684-patient randomized, controlled clinical trial (the
  highest standard as far as drug testing goes), when patients were
  given the drug along with the other Alzheimer's drug, Aricept, it
  appeared to benefit cognition and patients’ daily functioning
  ability 6 months later, 
  Forbes reports.

  Full of promise or full of hype?

  Some in the biotech community, however, aren't quite so thrilled
  with Ramaswamy's approach.

  "He gathered a team together and without recruiting a single
  patient for a pivotal study of a marginal drug designed to treat
  symptoms of the disease, just raised $315 million in an upsized
  IPO that came in at the top of the range and promptly gyrated
  much higher today as investors bought in," 
  writes John Carroll in a post for FierceBiotech, a watchdog
  news group of which he serves as Editor-in-Chief.

  Ramaswamy's company, 
  writes Carroll, has "no track record, no experience, and one
  questionable product."

  "Given the fact that GlaxoSmithKline had a chance to take a look
  at this drug in the clinic, and concluded that they couldn't do
  better than selling it for lunch money, the IPO terms illustrate
  the kind of overnight riches a select few can find on Wall
  Street, provided you have the right kind of friends with money,"
  
  Carroll writes.

  Axovant plans to begin another trial testing the drug, which it's
  calling RVT-101, this time using the generic version of Aricept,
  called donezepil.

Indian American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, 30, shocked a lot of people when he turned $5 million into $3 billion with Axovant Sciences’ initial public offering.Now, as featured in the Sept. 28 cover story for Forbes Magazine, Ramaswamy is poised to repeat history.In June, Ramaswamy was at the forefront of the biggest IPO in the history of the American biotechnology industry. The Bermuda-based company, with offices also in New York, has just one product: a dementia drug to treat Alzheimer’s.
Axovant was formed eight months prior to the IPO and raised roughly $360 million to develop the drug that was essentially abandoned by GlaxoSmithKline. By the end of the first day on the New York Stock Exchange, Axovant had a market capitalization of about $3 billion. Ramaswamy had purchased the drug from Glaxo for $5 million.A graduate of Harvard College with an A.B. in biology and the recipient of a law degree from Yale Law School, Ramaswamy is a former hedge fund partner.There were skeptics who wondered how a company could be worth so much. The stock had dipped 12 percent below the IPO price by the beginning of the month.And while Ramaswamy was touting that Axovant’s goal “is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of dementia,” they had yet to generate any revenue, even as other companies were creating drugs to compete with his company’s product.But now, as Axovant drifts to the backdrop, Ramaswamy is up to his old tricks: rescuing the pharmaceutical industry’s forgotten drugs, according to Forbes.Ramaswamy said Axovant is the first step in a broader mission to liberate abandoned or deprioritized drugs, the report said.It’s not unprecedented. Drugs like Lipitor and Imbruvica have also almost faced extinction before being presented anew to the world. Ramaswamy hopes to do the same for dozens of companies.
“This will be the highest return on investment endeavor ever taken up in the pharmaceutical industry,” he boasted in the Forbes report. “It will be a pipeline every bit as deep and diverse as the most promising pharma company in the world but with a capital efficiency that is unprecedented.”As an analyst, Ramaswamy noticed there were several forgotten drugs that he would have liked to invest in but couldn’t. They were trapped in big pharmaceutical firms that had shelved them for strategic or bureaucratic reasons, or in small biotechnology firms that had to focus all their resources on a single product, no matter how good option No. 2 was, the Forbes report said.The Indian American accomplished successful returns with his company Roivant Sciences’ 76 percent stake in Axovant, as well as turning an $8 million purchase of drugs to treat liver virus hepatitis B into $110 million in Arbutus BioPharma. With Roivant, in May, he bought a psychosis drug for $4 million from Arena Pharmaceuticals and later partnered with a Duke University group known for inventing rare-disease drugs.Axovant speculators will have to wait until 2017 before they hear any new drug data for Alzheimer’s, during which the stock could drift without a bona fide catalyst, said Forbes. Under the best possible scenario, real benefit to Alzheimer’s patients is years away.But it would be a mistake to get stuck in the weeds of Roivant’s Alzheimer’s efforts. Ramaswamy’s approach is long term and broad in scope and even if Axovant’s efforts fail, the money raised will help with finding other compounds of drugs that could be more effective.

As a student at Harvard University Vivek Ramaswamy realized that even in Cambridge, Mass., which boasts of two world-class universities — Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — students with entrepreneurial aspirations had difficulty connecting with potential partners and investors. He decided to do something about it. In 2007, his final year at Harvard, Ramaswamy partnered with fellow student Travis May and co-founded StudentBusinesses.com, a website to connect students with the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The duo also developed two supporting software products. In 2009, they sold their business to the U.S.-based Kauffman Foundation, which is focused on advancing innovation and training future business leaders (Kauffman later rebranded StudentBusinesses.com as iStart). In a conversation with India Knowledge@Wharton, Ramaswamy, who is currently a student at the Yale Law School, shared his views on entrepreneurship and his own business ventures. Ramaswamy describes himself as an “accidental entrepreneur” and says that the experience of starting something new can be a valuable in itself.
An edited version of the interview follows.
India Knowledge@Wharton: What are your views on entrepreneurship in America?







Vivek Ramaswamy: This may sound trite, but I believe it to be true: Entrepreneurship is the fabric of what America is all about. The recent resurgence in entrepreneurship is a resurgence of something quintessentially American. It has been responsible for driving this country in years past and will drive it forward in the future as well. The shift of the entrepreneurial age towards a younger age bracket indicates a potential uptick going forward as these younger, aspiring entrepreneurs gain more experience. 
India Knowledge@Wharton: How do you see the current entrepreneurial resurgence as being different from earlier?
Ramaswamy: I would think the correlation between an era of increased globalization and an increased desire to participate in an entrepreneurial endeavor is not a coincidence. When interconnectedness is at a peak due to technological advances, the ability to spawn something new is slightly easier.
India Knowledge@Wharton: In your view, how are American universities adjusting to this new trend?
Ramaswamy: Today, with the Internet, social networking, and other media, people are [becoming increasingly] interconnected, making the original hotbeds of entrepreneurship not as distant as they once were. The emergence of web-based tools to achieve that interconnectedness is spawning entrepreneurship programs at universities across the country. Our business …, StudentBusinesses.com, was focused on the issue of university entrepreneurship. The number of universities in the past five years that have added either business plan competitions or entrepreneurship education programs has dwarfed the same five-year trend in any period before it, at least to the extent that I am aware. Most of these [programs] are actually at universities that are outside of the typical so-called “hotbed” regions. I think a big part of the reason for this is what the Internet and other technology and media have accomplished in connecting those places that are more geographically distant from the traditional hotbeds.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Are you suggesting, for example, that while a place like Silicon Valley would have been geographically or academically inaccessible to people one to two decades ago, it is now possible to connect folks in disparate geographies to work collaboratively?
Ramaswamy: Exactly. It is an ability to access what is happening in those places typically known for entrepreneurship and to use that to plant a seed in a wide range of other places. 
India Knowledge@Wharton: The objective of StudentBusinesses.com was to connect young students with the entrepreneurial ecosystem and tap into their energy. Some research however shows that the majority of successful entrepreneurs have had years of experience and also industry know-how before they went out on their own. How did you envision bridging that gap?
Ramaswamy: It is a distinction we were acutely cognizant of at the time we started StudentBusinesses.com. Some folks we approached at the initial stages to join us as advisors and consultants told us that they didn’t believe in our concept because they [felt that] a person needed to have substantial industry experience in order to become an entrepreneur.


Knowledge@Wharton High School






We viewed it a little differently. [We felt that] young people, including those coming out of the university programs, are at a stage in their lives when they are able to take the biggest risks. They [also] have a fresh perspective that’s not colored by industry experience. That inexperience or freshness can be catalyzing. Of course, it could potentially impose limitations on the types of things that young students may envision themselves doing. We wanted to tap into that innovative lens [that] younger people at universities possess. Recognizing the value that experience could add, one of our major initial theses was that the experience of starting something new can be a valuable experience in itself.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Even if the venture doesn’t result in anything?
Ramaswamy: Absolutely. That act of trying can be its own experience and that was part of our thesis from the very beginning in terms of the value created for a student by founding his or her own startup company.
India Knowledge@Wharton: You launched StudentBusinesses.com in 2007, the semester before you graduated from Harvard. Times were good then [economically]. We didn’t think about the world as we do today. How did you and your co-founder Travis May manage to get ahead of the curve? Did you see this coming?
Ramaswamy: [Actually] it was a very difficult time to start a business. Even though the message of entrepreneurship becoming all the more important was not lost on people, the conditions of fear that existed at that time were somewhat of an adversity that we faced in launching the company.
India Knowledge@Wharton: StudentBusinesses.com paired up entrepreneurially-minded students with people who were interested in their concepts. Can you tell us more about it?
Ramaswamy: The site — StudentBusinesses.com — had two searchable databases — “Businesses in the Game” and “Students on the Roster.” Aspiring and current entrepreneurs could join either of these for free. While entrepreneurs could post a profile that described their business and what they were looking for on “Businesses in the Game”, those interested in joining a start-up could [sign up on to] “Students on the Roster.”
Over time, our site also expanded to include two software-as-a-service products — B Plan Studio and Start-Up Space. B Plan Studio enabled university entrepreneurship programs to conduct a business plan competition in a seamless fashion and in a way that preserved the data and the information that was gained in that competition. Start-Up Space enabled universities, and in particular business schools, to create internal networks of aspiring entrepreneurial students on their campuses.
India Knowledge@Wharton: StudentBusinesses.com built these proprietary software platforms?
Ramaswamy: Yes, we built that software, which was modeled on some of the same aspects as our website.
India Knowledge@Wharton: In the StudentBusinesses.com model the students sign up for free, while the external professionals who are interested in tapping into these students pay [for] a subscription. How were you able to convince people to pay for another site subscription?
Ramaswamy: The primary users of the site, from the non-student perspective, were actually professional service providers who were seeking to expand their businesses to include start-ups. [For instance,] law firms that were looking at targeting a new clientele, or web development and IT consulting firms that were generating revenue by serving large corporations but were interested in taking a little bit more risk in working with younger companies.
[But] it was never our main objective to market this aspect. We wanted to build a strong database and network of student entrepreneurs. We were acquired within two years of our launch [so] the process of going beyond that first step perhaps lies in the hands of our acquirer, the Kauffman Foundation.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Could you talk a little bit about the acquisition of StudentBusinesses.com by the Kauffman Foundation? 
Ramaswamy: One of our objectives from the very start was to not only succeed in our own right as a business, but also from a more social entrepreneurship perspective to enable other businesses to do the same thing. It is that spirit that led the Kauffman Foundation to be the best acquirer. They are the world’s largest foundation devoted to entrepreneurship and one of the largest foundations in the United States. I think one of the [reasons] that Kauffman looked at us was to find a platform around which to organize some of their activities including, but not limited to, their expansion into the university entrepreneurship space. At the end of the day, our consideration was not just a financial one, but the knowledge that our platform would be taken in the direction we had in mind from day one — fostering entrepreneurship among young people across this country.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Can you tell us about the experiences that have shaped you as an entrepreneur?
Ramaswamy: From a personal standpoint, I consider myself much more of an accidental entrepreneur. I was involved in the entrepreneurship club at Harvard but I heard of it only because it was new on campus.
India Knowledge@Wharton: But the club obviously didn’t fulfill what you wanted it to.
Ramaswamy: I saw so much potential among the aspirations of the students who were [at Harvard]. I suspected [it would be the same] at universities across the country. These aspirations weren’t being served and harnessed.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Is there an example of something frustrating that happened or a specific point when you and Travis said, “We can do this better.” What was the spark that made it into something more?
Ramaswamy: We observed, for example, that there were a lot of people at Harvard who were idea-driven but didn’t have technical skills to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish. They were always looking among their own community for people who had technical skills to help them launch a new idea that they had.
India Knowledge@Wharton: The next Facebook?
Ramaswamy: Exactly. And the fact that Facebook was launched during my time at Harvard probably impacted other people’s aspirations. Students had these great ideas. They didn’t have the technical ability to do it themselves, but they knew what they wanted to accomplish and all they needed was to find the right persons, except that Harvard was filled with a bunch of similar people. However, right down the street you have Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has a higher concentration of people with world-class technical capabilities. Though separated by only two subway stops, this distance was enough of a barrier to limit the type of communication that should have been taking place. If that barrier existed within Cambridge among these two heavyweight institutions, one could only imagine the gulf at a national level.

India Knowledge@Wharton: StudentBusinesses.com paired up entrepreneurially-minded students with people who were interested in their concepts. Can you tell us more about it?
Ramaswamy: The site — StudentBusinesses.com — had two searchable databases — “Businesses in the Game” and “Students on the Roster.” Aspiring and current entrepreneurs could join either of these for free. While entrepreneurs could post a profile that described their business and what they were looking for on “Businesses in the Game”, those interested in joining a start-up could [sign up on to] “Students on the Roster.”
Over time, our site also expanded to include two software-as-a-service products — B Plan Studio and Start-Up Space. B Plan Studio enabled university entrepreneurship programs to conduct a business plan competition in a seamless fashion and in a way that preserved the data and the information that was gained in that competition. Start-Up Space enabled universities, and in particular business schools, to create internal networks of aspiring entrepreneurial students on their campuses.
India Knowledge@Wharton: StudentBusinesses.com built these proprietary software platforms?
Ramaswamy: Yes, we built that software, which was modeled on some of the same aspects as our website.
India Knowledge@Wharton: In the StudentBusinesses.com model the students sign up for free, while the external professionals who are interested in tapping into these students pay [for] a subscription. How were you able to convince people to pay for another site subscription?
Ramaswamy: The primary users of the site, from the non-student perspective, were actually professional service providers who were seeking to expand their businesses to include start-ups. [For instance,] law firms that were looking at targeting a new clientele, or web development and IT consulting firms that were generating revenue by serving large corporations but were interested in taking a little bit more risk in working with younger companies.
[But] it was never our main objective to market this aspect. We wanted to build a strong database and network of student entrepreneurs. We were acquired within two years of our launch [so] the process of going beyond that first step perhaps lies in the hands of our acquirer, the Kauffman Foundation.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Could you talk a little bit about the acquisition of StudentBusinesses.com by the Kauffman Foundation? 
Ramaswamy: One of our objectives from the very start was to not only succeed in our own right as a business, but also from a more social entrepreneurship perspective to enable other businesses to do the same thing. It is that spirit that led the Kauffman Foundation to be the best acquirer. They are the world’s largest foundation devoted to entrepreneurship and one of the largest foundations in the United States. I think one of the [reasons] that Kauffman looked at us was to find a platform around which to organize some of their activities including, but not limited to, their expansion into the university entrepreneurship space. At the end of the day, our consideration was not just a financial one, but the knowledge that our platform would be taken in the direction we had in mind from day one — fostering entrepreneurship among young people across this country.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Can you tell us about the experiences that have shaped you as an entrepreneur?
Ramaswamy: From a personal standpoint, I consider myself much more of an accidental entrepreneur. I was involved in the entrepreneurship club at Harvard but I heard of it only because it was new on campus.
India Knowledge@Wharton: But the club obviously didn’t fulfill what you wanted it to.
Ramaswamy: I saw so much potential among the aspirations of the students who were [at Harvard]. I suspected [it would be the same] at universities across the country. These aspirations weren’t being served and harnessed.
India Knowledge@Wharton: Is there an example of something frustrating that happened or a specific point when you and Travis said, “We can do this better.” What was the spark that made it into something more?
Ramaswamy: We observed, for example, that there were a lot of people at Harvard who were idea-driven but didn’t have technical skills to accomplish what they wanted to accomplish. They were always looking among their own community for people who had technical skills to help them launch a new idea that they had.
India Knowledge@Wharton: The next Facebook?
Ramaswamy: Exactly. And the fact that Facebook was launched during my time at Harvard probably impacted other people’s aspirations. Students had these great ideas. They didn’t have the technical ability to do it themselves, but they knew what they wanted to accomplish and all they needed was to find the right persons, except that Harvard was filled with a bunch of similar people. However, right down the street you have Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has a higher concentration of people with world-class technical capabilities. Though separated by only two subway stops, this distance was enough of a barrier to limit the type of communication that should have been taking place. If that barrier existed within Cambridge among these two heavyweight institutions, one could only imagine the gulf at a national level.

Vivek Ramaswamy: Boy in the bubble
As the biotech market boils over, prodigy Vivek Ramaswamy is engineering a flurry of deals that rescue drugs forgotten by the big firms. It might make him a billionaire at 30

	In June, Vivek Ramaswamy, a 29-year-old former hedge fund partner, cancelled his honeymoon plans to hike in the French and Swiss Alps. He instead brought his bride to stand beside him as he rang the bell of the New York Stock Exchange to launch the biggest initial public offering in the history of the American biotechnology industry. What could be more romantic than a few hundred million in paper gains in a single day?Ramaswamy’s Bermuda-based company, Axovant Sciences, had been formed only eight months earlier, but here it was raising $360 million to develop an Alzheimer’s drug that had been all but abandoned by giant pharma GlaxoSmithKline. On the first day of trading, the stock almost doubled, giving Axovant a market capitalisation of nearly $3 billion. Considering that Ramaswamy had persuaded Glaxo to part with the unproven remedy for just $5 million upfront, the newlyweds were ecstatic, as was a veritable wedding party of hedge fund pals who had followed Ramaswamy into the stock. Yet as quickly as it started, the honeymoon was over. ‘Why would Glaxo sell off a promising drug for so little?’ critics asked. And how could a company with ten employees, two of whom were Ramaswamy’s mother and brother, be worth so much? Experts, analysts and the collective blogosphere quickly piled on, and Axovant’s shares went into free fall. By early September, they were trading 12 percent below the IPO price. The naysayers have positioned the young and charming Ramaswamy as the poster boy for a biotech bubble. That’s not hard to do when the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has surged 300 percent in five years, compared with a 100 percent gain for the broader Nasdaq index and 70 percent for the S&P 500. Scary numbers, despite a plethora of real breakthroughs, including cancer drugs that shrink tumours, cures for hepatitis C and treatments that replace defective genes. And they’d be positively terrifying if the government stops approving or paying high prices for so many drugs.But this creeping fear ignores the full scope of what Ramaswamy is up to: Rescuing the pharmaceutical industry’s forgotten drugs. Whether or not the Axovant drug works, the IPO, according to Ramaswamy, is “a first step on a broader mission” to liberate abandoned or deprioritised drugs that routinely languish in the pipelines of pharma companies. “It’s an ethical problem of an underappre- ciated magnitude,” says Ramaswamy. “So many drugs that would have been of use to society are cast aside. Certain drugs have gone by the wayside for reasons that have nothing to do with their underlying merits.”Leaning on his Wall Street back- ground and armed with a $400 million war chest, Ramaswamy is building a portfolio not of stocks but of has-been drugs that he grabs for “pennies on the dollar”, free-riding on the billions in research that pharma sometimes sinks into failed trials. Using a pharmaceutical holding company he formed last year, Roivant Sciences, Ramaswamy hopes to spin out dozens of companies, much as he did with Axovant. “This will be the highest return on investment endeavour ever taken up in the pharmaceutical industry,” he boasts. “It will be a pipeline every bit as deep and diverse as the most promising pharma company in the world but with a capital efficiency that is unprecedented.”There’s precedent. Lipitor, the best-selling drug ever, was almost abandoned, and Imbruvica, the drug behind AbbVie’s $21 billion purchase of Pharmacyclics in May, was bought in 2006 as part of a $7 million deal.At least a dozen successful companies have been built around the purchase of a forgotten drug.And Ramaswamy has quickly established a track record: Roivant Sciences’s 76 percent stake in Axovant and its Alzheimer’s pill, code-named RVT-101, has produced a 20,000 percent paper return on its initial $5 million investment. Before that, Ramaswamy turned a $8 million purchase of several drugs to treat the liver virus hepatitis B into a $110 million stake in Arbutus BioPharma, a 1,275 percent paper return. In May, Roivant scooped up a drug for psychosis for $4 million from Arena Pharmaceuticals. It also partnered with a Duke University group with a track record for inventing rare-disease drugs. A whirlwind of such deals has made Ramaswamy, a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, biopharma’s youngest chief executive. He may soon be its youngest billionaire. Forbes estimates that Roivant is worth $3.5 billion, making its Millennial founder’s 20 percent or so stake worth some $700 million. Ramaswamy, who just turned 30, has bigger aspirations. Roivant, he says, will become the “Berkshire Hathaway of drug development”.


  Vivek Ramaswamy is any parent’s dream. He is the eldest son in a family of South Indian immigrants. His father was a company man at General Electric, and his mother worked for Merck and Schering-Plough as a geriatric psychiatrist. Ramaswamy was valedictorian at his high school in Cincinnati, an accomplished pianist who played for the Alzheimer’s patients his mom treated and a nationally ranked junior tennis player whose serve could hit 120 mph. At Harvard, he was chairman of the Harvard Political Union, worked in the lab of renowned stem cell scientist Douglas Melton and took the stage as a libertarian hip-hop artist named ‘Da Vek’. He also co-founded a company, StudentBusinesses.com, which connects startups, advisors and investors, and sold it to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which offers it as a free tool renamed iStart.But Ramaswamy, who graduated in biology, wanted to change the world. He thought of becoming a doctor or a researcher but didn’t want to spend another decade in school. Then he discovered hedge funds, where a 25-year-old can control hundreds of millions. “When I first told my parents about it, they thought I was going into the landscaping business,” says Ramaswamy.He scored an interview with Dan Gold, who runs $3.5 billion QVT Financial in New York. “He was bright but also hungry,” recalls Gold. They wound up talking for several hours, discussing Ramaswamy’s senior thesis on the ethical issues involved with using stem cells to create human-animal hybrids. He became an analyst. With his biology training, Ramaswamy understood early the potential of drugs to treat hepatitis C, a blood-borne liver virus that afflicts at least 3 million Americans—and his resulting trades for QVT amazed Wall Street. In 2008, Ramaswamy started buying shares of Pharmasset, in Princeton, New Jersey, at about $5 on a split-adjusted basis and was one of the top shareholders when Gilead bought the company for $137 a share, or $11 billion, in 2011. Rama- swamy repeated the performance with Inhibitex, which was purchased by Bristol-Myers Squibb for $2.5 billion in 2012, making 25-fold QVT’s initial investment. At 28, Ramaswamy was made a QVT partner.On the side—“for the intellectual experience”—he earned a law degree from Yale. He was “one of the few people who did all the reading,” says Yale law professor David Grewal. “He always came to class ready to argue—he likes arguing.”Such critical thinking resulted in an epiphany: Ramaswamy noticed there were many, many forgotten drugs that he would have liked to invest in but couldn’t. They were trapped in big pharmaceutical firms that had shelved them for strategic or bureaucratic reasons, or in small biotechnology firms that had to focus all their resources on a single product. Speaking at a Down syndrome fundraiser in North Carolina, he laid out the moral case: “There is probably a promising drug candidate that has already been discovered for the treatment of Down syndrome that is sitting on the shelf of some drug company.”When Ramaswamy struck out on his own last May, QVT and Dexcel  Pharma, an Israeli firm that had no- ticed his track record, backed him to the tune of nearly $100 million. He named his company Roivant—he’s fond of the acronym “ROI”—and set out to deliver high returns on investment from a relatively shabby rent-an-office building for startups in mid-town Manhattan. His small, disparate crew, including some young Ivy League graduates and two biotech heavyweights—Larry Friedhoff, 66, the former head of R&D at Eisai and Andrx, and William Symonds, 48, who had been instrumental in the success of Pharmasset and Gilead—occupied a disjointed space where they couldn’t even sit together. No matter. “To be honest, if I was going to bet on a human to win at something,” says Symonds, “I would bet on Vivek.”The Pharmasset connection served them well. That company thrived because of a single hep C pill, called sofosbuvir, or Sovaldi, which, after being purchased by Gilead, had the best launch of any medicine ever, generating $12 billion in its first year. The drug was rumoured to be named after Mike Sofia, the chemist who invented it. Now Sofia had started a new company, OnCore Biopharma, to fight a different kind of hepatitis, hep B. Thanks to vaccination, it’s less of a problem in the US, but it kills 780,000 people a year, largely in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, by causing liver complications like cancer.

  As with hepatitis C and HIV, treating hep B would require multiple drugs in combination. Yet promising candidates were spread across the pharma universe, another market failure. So Ramaswamy took control of OnCore and executed three more deals to bring four other forgotten drugs into the pipeline. He took the faster route to going public by merging OnCore into Tekmira, a Nasdaq-listed company developing more antiviral drugs, and renaming it Arbutus. In the course of seven months, Ramaswamy had turned an initial $8 million investment into $110 million of market value.With this instant success, Ramaswamy was poised to think bigger. Everyone knows that Alzheimer’s is a scourge—it’s forecast to afflict 13.8 million Americans and cost the US economy $1 trillion annually by 2050. But it’s also a pharma death trap. Between 2002 and 2012, researchers tested 244 Alzheimer’s drugs, and only one made it to market—a 99.6 percent failure rate.Ramaswamy’s research chief, Friedhoff, had led the development of Aricept, the best-selling Alzheim- er’s drug ever, with $4 billion in peak sales. When his young boss told him he was interested in the cast-off Glaxo drug, Friedhoff told him to find something less risky than Alzheimer’s. But Ramaswamy kept hearing that the drug was worth a look. “When people have asked me over the years, ‘Are there any drugs that should have gone forward, that should get another chance?,’ this one comes to mind,” says Rachelle Doody, a top Alzheimer’s researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine who worked with the drug when it was Glaxo’s.Symonds set up a meeting with Atul Pande, Glaxo’s senior vice president in charge of neuroscience research. They found Pande was effusive about the drug (so much so that he would eventually leave to become an Axovant director), which had been a victim of Glaxo’s technical retreat from neuroscience. In 2010, Glaxo had announced that it was mostly going to exit the field, and any lingering interest in Alzheimer’s drugs would focus on reversing the disease instead of relieving symptoms.But when Ramaswamy looked at the data for the drug, he saw a winner. It had failed the first three clinical trials that tested the drug alone. But Ramaswamy and many experts believe animal data that show RVT-101 will work far better when paired with an older drug like Aricept. A fourth study offered evidence of that, but the trial failed because Glaxo picked the wrong endpoint. In the fourth study, RVT-101 reversed Alzheimer’s patients’ symptoms to where they had been more than six months before, but then the disease’s merciless progression continued. Still, if the next trial can show the same benefit—or even a slightly weaker one—that would be enough to get the medicine approved. More comfort: Another drug being developed by the Danish drug firm Lundbeck targets the same brain receptor as RVT-101 and shows similar results. Friedhoff, Roivant’s renowned Alzheimer’s expert, was convinced.Now the only problem was getting the drug out of Glaxo. Eventually, Ramaswamy got the terms he wanted: Just $5 million upfront but also $160 million in milestones and a 12.5 percent royalty on sales. Basically, he gives big companies a chance to win big—if RVT-101 ever becomes a $1 billion seller, the royalties would boost Glaxo’s earnings by 2 percent. With the drug in hand, Ramaswamy decided to spin out Axovant—the company built around RVT-101 as its only asset—hitting up his old hedge fund peers. “He comes from our world,” says Peter Kolchinsky, who runs $1.8 billion RA Capital. “I saw the data, and I knew that if I didn’t say yes, it was going to go to someone else.” Kolchinsky’s condition: He wanted a big position. He bought $75 million worth, his fund’s largest holding, at the IPO price. So did hedge fund Visium Asset Management. Mutual fund managers like Capital Growth and Janus also bought in. In order to signal to investors that the hedge funds would not take advantage of a first-day pop, the funds agreed to hold their shares for at least 90 days—a costly move, since Axovant shot up nearly 100 percent after its IPO in June, but then fell below its offering price. “The markets can fluctuate, but the fundamentals haven’t changed,” says Kolchinsky.

	A decade ago, raising $100 million in a biotech offering was unheard of. Today it’s commonplace. In January, venture capitalists put $450 million into Moderna Therapeutics, a company with fascinating science but no drugs in testing, and a few months later they gave $217 million to Denali Therapeutics, another company focussed on Alzheimer’s as well as Parkinson’s. The public markets are also bubbling. In July, NantKwest, the latest company from biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, raised $207 million at a $3 billion valuation based on its new cancer-killing cells.Amid this rush of money, Ramaswamy’s big Alzheimer’s IPO spooked investors. After all, for Ramaswamy’s team, Axovant is a no-lose investment, given the minuscule price it paid Glaxo for RVT-101. But public investors understandably fear being set up as greater fools. This doesn’t bode well for the young dealmaker’s grand scheme. Says Ramaswamy, “It’s ironic because it will be the same capital-efficient approach that brought RVT-101 that will be our model for building our business going forward.” Axovant speculators will have to wait until 2017 before they hear of any new RVT-101 data for Alzheimer’s. Under the best possible scenario, real benefit to Alzheimer’s patients is years way. Clinical trials are notoriously difficult even when the remedy seems to work—and expensive. It may ultimately take $135 million to run the trial on RVT-101.But it would be a mistake to get stuck in the weeds of Roivant’s Alzheimer’s efforts. Ramaswamy’s approach is long term and broad in scope. In many ways, he is taking a page from the career of Michael Pearson, the billionaire chief executive of Valeant Pharmaceuticals. In the early 2000s, when drug approvals were approaching an all-time low, Pearson came up with a financial engineering strategy that produced a company now worth $80 billion, using a tax shelter to buy drugs that were underperforming and cutting costs, including R&D, to the bone. It’s a successful approach that has won Wall Street approval, most notably from Bill Ackman, whose Pershing Square hedge fund owns 5.7 percent of Valeant. Ramaswamy is doing something similar, except he’s betting that biotech is so productive at inventing new remedies that he can find forgotten drugs for cheap and fund more R&D, not less. “It’s a specialty biotech that will create value out of products that are yet to reach the market rather than extracting value out of dwindling revenue streams,” he says. Ramaswamy has something Pearson lacks: Charisma. “I tend to like people who are a little bold and get things done, but do it in a way that isn’t obnoxious,” says Brent Saunders, the chief executive of Allergan. “I think Vivek fits the bill so far.”Like Pearson, Ramaswamy has an innovative strategy for growth. Even if RVT-101 fails, Axovant has used it to raise nearly $200 million it can spend on other compounds. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy’s Roivant vehicle, still sitting on nearly $100 million, will be buying other drugs, which he can spin off or house in silos, letting him tailor and incentivise specialised teams around each effort. This approach will allow him to spread his bets in fund-of-fund fashion, as well as give potential investors pure-play action in an array of therapeutic areas. Ramaswamy’s youthful enthusiasm and hubris haven’t gone unnoticed. But however the drugs perform, there’s real financial innovation here, with potential to save and improve countless lives, whether through him or others who emulate the model. And that’s something a biotech bubble, whenever it bursts, can’t wash away.

Vivek Ramaswamy’s Plans
By Derek LoweJanuary 11, 2017


I last wrote about Vivek Ramaswamy in the context of his first company (Axovant). That one went public on the hopes for a retread Alzheimer’s drug to work out in Phase III, and if that sounds a little iffy to you, then join a fairly large club. Alzheimer’s is truly the approach-avoidance conflict writ large: from one perspective you have a massive, ever-expanding patient population in wealthy industrialized countries, almost totally unserved by existing therapies and willing to pay handsomely for something that really works. From the other perspective you have a slow-moving disease that’s very difficult to diagnose well, in a heterogeneous patient population that tends to show several comorbidities, giving you a corresponding need for large trial enrollments, but with no good animal models to guide you to the clinic and a clinical success rate that’s basically 0.0%. It’s a high-voltage standoff.
You would never know, to read a lot of Ramaswamy’s press coverage (here’s a recent profile from TechCrunch) that the Axovant drug works through a mechanism that has failed twice in Alzheimer’s clinical trials so far. It has an extremely low chance of working this time, too – if there’s some convincing reason why this latest attempt should succeed where the others have failed, I haven’t heard it. So the risk/reward behind Axovant’s IPO makes no sense to me at all. But that hasn’t slowed the man down: his company Myovant had a big ol’ IPO back in the fall, built on a former Takeda candidate for uterine fibroids. Here’s the latest addition. According to that profile piece, Ramaswamy is building a whole portfolio of companies based on compounds like this:
The idea, explains Ramaswamy, is to create individual companies around each drug or small groupings of candidates that Roivant acquires, then install the scientists who developed the drugs and provide them with big rewards if the drugs prove useful. If the drugs don’t pan out, Roivant will  find another place for the scientists — potentially at another company under its umbrella.
Fine; I like not firing people. You wouldn’t know from such articles, though, that there have been (and are) other companies which have been formed around the idea of taking pharma cast-offs and getting them through the clinic (larger companies already try to monetize what they can in their portfolio by partnering or outlicensing, of course). The Medicines Company is one such dealmaker, acquiring and partnering late-stage compounds and trying to get them approved. Outside of the for-profit business model, there are a number of initiatives trying to repurpose or revive older compounds for new diseases.No one so far has been able to take over the world doing this. There are not, unfortunately, many big piles of such candidates sitting around. Most of the shelved compounds were shelved because (a) they did not work, and/or (b) they showed toxicity. You’re going to have to figure a way around those problems before you go back into humans, and that’s not easy. There are a few drugs that have been dropped for business reasons, or were lost or mishandled during a merger or the like, but I don’t think that there are enough of those to make a Ramaswamy drug empire.
From that same profile, I found this to be a bit odd-sounding:
Whether the scheme will work longer term isn’t clear, but it’s easy to appreciate why people like Seely and Shih were drawn to Ramaswamy’s vision. At traditional, top-down pharmaceutical companies, scientists aren’t typically rewarded when a drug they’ve developed becomes a blockbuster, and failed drugs often translate into job cuts.
“It sounds vanilla, but I can’t overstate the importance of re-aligning R&D personnel,” says Ramaswamy of his decentralized approach. “A lot of what you see in conventional pharma R&D is, because [scientists’] jobs are on the line if their projects fail, in many instances, clinical studies aren’t designed to get the answer but instead not get the answer. There’s a kick-the-can mentality.” By addressing that incentive misalignment, he insists, “we’ve stacked the odds in our favor.”
OK, let’s take these one by one. I have seen nothing about just how these new companies are going to reward people if the drug makes it to market. I will also note that people do actually have incentives at other drug companies to get things to market – it sounds stupid to have to say this, but that second paragraph seems to make it necessary. I have no idea what Ramaswamy is talking about when he says that clinical trials are designed to “not get the answer”, and I would welcome some clarification. The only kick-the-can stuff I see is done by small companies that are trolling for some kind of deal or partnership, and they’re taking a very large risk when they do things that way. Otherwise, there’s simply no point for a company to run a clinical trial that is not directly aimed at their business interests. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, no one but a blockhead ever went into the clinic except for money. It’s damned expensive, and you want to get the best answer you can get in the shortest time it takes to get it.
So I don’t see the misaligned incentives that Ramaswamy does, and how this stacks the odds in his favor is another question. The proteins, cells, and organs that are being targeted in the patients are impervious to bold statements and applause in the press. They don’t care what your business model is, or how your IPO went. They will do what they do, and what they do most of the time, unfortunately, is not what we want them to. In Alzheimer’s, they let us down pretty near every time. I don’t see anything that Vivek Ramaswamy is doing that will change that.

I think a lot of Phase 2 trials (especially in cancer) are so underpowered that Ramaswamy is partly correct in saying “not get the answer”….for many companies, the “wrong” answer is a death knell, whereas anything even remotely better than placebo/standard of care, even if statistically insignificant, means progression to Phase 3.

Those are the examples I was thinking of, and they’re real. But larger companies, of the sort that he’s doing deals with, shouldn’t be running stuff like this.

My guess is Vivek is taking a similar approach to rewarding his R&D staff to that taken by Martin Shkreli, that is giving them a share of royalties should drug X be approved (I beleive this was discussed in this forum a few years ago).  There are clear limits to this approach in that there’s only so much royalty to give away, which will create some asymmetrical motivations even in the R&D staff.  I understand that R&D staff are incented [sic] to produce drugs in most companies, but not to the same degree employees at hedge funds (Vivek’s background) are rewarded for success.  As you point out, financially motivating scientists likely affects biological reality very little, and I plan to be short AXON prior to the P3 readout.
One could argue that LLY’s (hardly a small company) recent adventure into phase 3 with solan was a kick the can exercise—it wasn’t designed to fail (as most silly open label uncontrolled P2 studies little companies do are)—but it was certainly proposed by some R&D leader hoping to keep his/her job a while longer.

Yup- strongly agree. The statement “The only kick-the-can stuff I see is done by small companies that are trolling for some kind of deal or partnership” misses many instances of can kicking in Big Pharma (p38, TACE, yet another SIP1 agonist or B-amyloid ab) in which the known (side)effects or market position will ensure failure.

It’s also important to separate conscious kick-the-can from unconscious kick-the-can. People can get pretty attached to programs (especially if their jobs are on the line for failure), and can be quite adept at soft-pedaling and self-delusion.

I don’t think “trials with a low chance of success” is the same as “designed not to get the answer” in the Ramaswamy quote.
For one thing, his structure wouldn’t correct those incentives at all–if you get even more rewards when “your” compound makes it you’re certainly going to find new variations on every measurement to see if you can get something out there.

I’m not sure I’m understanding things properly here.
By kicking the can I take that to mean that a clinical trial is often designed not to provide a definitive answer but simply to get enough info to progress to the next clinical trial.  Even with that, however, candidates often fail.  In short, they can’t even clear that lower barrier.
So now Ramaswamy believes that by getting to the answer they’ll be able to rescue these drugs that failed to get through a lower hurdle?  That honestly doesn’t sound logical or am I missing something here?
Is his model is to fail faster (nothing new there) and have the R&D folks move on to the next thing, but isn’t that the same as what everyone is trying to do?  And by incentivizing people even more for the success of a project means that you’re incentivizing against fail faster, right?
Someone set me straight.

There’s no kick-the-can stuff at AZ, Merck or Pfizer?
Really? When I was working at a big pharma I saw this all the time.  Add to this he is right, I don’t think pharma incentivizes enough for success.  If you don’t believe me look at the difference between annual bonuses and annual saleries for scientists vs. say executives.
Let’s put it this way, where would you rather discover a blockbuster drug?  A big pharma or a small start-up?

The chances are higher that I’ll keep my job if I help find a blockbuster in Big Pharma – if I find one in a small pharma, chances are I’ll get cashiered to fund the next set of trials. Getting enough equity to get a decent payout from the success is not also terribly certain. Given the amount of data that you can afford to collect (or the incentives of management), is your chance of finding a blockbuster higher at a small pharma than a big pharma?
It depends what you want and your level of risk tolerance, but payout from a blockbuster seems like a poor reason to choose a startup.

@ Hap
“Chances are better I will keep my job in big pharma”
Unfortunately this statement isn’t in keeping with my personal experience.  I know personally four people who have either discovered drugs or clinical candidates.  Three are no longer at their respective companies with 2/3 of those being involuntary.
Let’s be real, at the end of the day it’s all about who can brown nose the best with the decision makers.  Generally lab rats who make tons of compounds don’t do that well in that regard.
As for working at start ups the only reason I see is being a larger part of the process.  That’s part a monetary thing and part how much control you get over your ideas.

Axovant is Drug Discovery Theatre with the sole aim of enriching the principals.
On a related topic – “how to appropriately provide incentives for success in a matrix organization” would be a long thread.  We’d all agree but how to implement?
A) My 2-3 proudest lifetime achievements were pre-clinical efforts that died at various stages in Development due to no shortcomings/no input from my team.
B) A project I was involved with for 6 months went to P2.  I got my name on the patents, etc. but I can’t honestly say my fingerprints were on the drug.
Who should get the bigger reward, A or B?  In other words, who should be valued more highly by the organization?

That’s a fair question to which I don’t know there’s a fair answer.  B will be valued more highly by the investors who make the whole thing possible.

I’ve definitely seen kick-the-can exercises at both Big Pharma and academia.  In Big Pharma, jobs and bonuses are often tied to “progressing” a drug, regardless of what the biology is telling you.  But that said, I’ve never seen a clinical trial at a big company designed to fall short of significance.  (I agree that small companies often run “safety” studies that are really underpowered efficacy studies designed to sell the company.)  In academia, people get awfully attached to the hypothesis that got them their initial grants, so there is a perverse disincentive to believe Truth even when it smacks you in the face.  (Lookin’ at you, Peter Duesberg…)
As for running with Big Pharma’s castoffs, one of the best examples might be Speedel pushing forward with Aliskiren from Novartis.  But that was a little murky, with Novartis investing in Speedel and then purchasing the company later on, so it may have just been a way to shield the larger company from the serious safety issues the drug had/has.  I actually have no idea — this is just conjecture.  Anyone know?

When I read this yesterday, I immediately thought of Theranos. Not the same exact situation, but hype sure smells like it.  It isn’t as “groundbreaking”, but it is close.  After all the press releases I have seen in my time.  There is a time to say ‘yes’ to having pieces written about you, and my internal clock says at least 1 success.

Sounds like another application for Hollywood accounting.  Set up an LLC or limited partnership for each drug, have parent pharma “lend” it the money to conduct trials, and pass out a few shares in the special-purpose vehicle to the researchers.  Of course, if the drug does hit, all of the profits get eaten up in “fees” and interest owed by the SPV to the parent, so everybody gets rich while the drug remains unprofitable on an accounting basis.

A bit off topic, but I don’t understand how investors go for this business model. He can only run an effective clinical trial if they raise money through an IPO. The stock price is only going to increase upon successful clinical news, which is years away (it will go down as founders cash out – axovant down >40%). As an investor why not buy 2x the stock for the same price a year after the IPO? However, if everyone did this there would be no IPO and thus no clinical trial. Therefore, the initial investors fund the clinical trial, but minimize their potential gains. I am not an investor though, so I must be missing something.

Daptomycin (Cubicin) is one example of a drug that a small company brought profitably to market when a big company shelved it. Gleevec had been shelved when Ciba abandoned PDGFr as a cancer target, but proved to be a $billion/yr property when Pazdur/FDA compelled them(Novartis) to develop it (for CML). But I don’t see a lot more such examples on the shelf.  More likely, many drugs that could be very efficacious against pre-cancerous states have failed in Clinical trials against advanced cancers that had acquired many mutations.
     Some of these could be life-saving and profitable, but will only move forward if/when our FDA recognizes these pre-cancerous states as ‘diseases’.

Interesting. An example: cervical dysplasia is a precancerous state and often treated as a disease up to and including surgical excision. Are other precancerous states not handled the same way? That seems very foolish…

Pharma’s drug development scrap heap is just bulging with gold nuggets that have been wrongly thrown out by useless incompetent scientists and are just waiting to be recycled by Vivek the drug prophet.
Yeah right.
More like he knows how to polish a turd and sell crap to naive investors before the polish wears off.  Well we saw what happened with Valeant – the protagonist makes billions and the investors lose their shirt, while the patients gain nothing.  This model has nothing to do with real drug development.

Desperate times results in simple minded people flocking to the eloquent.  The current pharma climate has detached scientific reason from business decisions.  Science and BD are drifting apart.  When has a pharma executive led BD deal ever been shot down during scientific due diligence?  I have not seen it at my pharma.  Maybe I am blind.

I actually think that there are good compounds out there that have been, for a variety of reasons, been tossed aside by Pharma and that can be shepherded to becoming a drug.
However, IMO, it’s not for the reasons that Ramaswamy states.  And there lies the problem with the business model.  If you’ve misdiagnosed, you’re going to mistreat.

While incentives are nice, pay usually comes down to market forces. For those of you on the clinical side you will see medical doctors make a ton of money, but not really contribute very much of anything, beyond adding their credential to a protocol. They mostly regurgitate what they can from MSLs.  Then the present clinical data to basic scientists and basic science data to clinical folks (so to each party this MD is looked up to as someone who is filling a knowledge gap).  The best incentives for early development folks would be a priority class of stock options/shares. However the VCs usually prevent that from happening.

The real forgotten drugs are compounds that can’t be patented or where patents expired. They might be very useful for treating diseases different from what they were originally used for, but no one has any interest of funding clinical trials for these as there is no money to be made.
