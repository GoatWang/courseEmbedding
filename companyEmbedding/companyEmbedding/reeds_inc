							Reed’s Products					
Using the same skills that go into a fine microbrew or wine, Reeds is actually brewed in a brewery, where our expert brewmasters control every step of the process. The ingredients and process are so expensive, no reasonable business people would do it (even if they could figure out how). However, we are happy to lack reason in this regard, and that’s why we have become the top-selling beverage in the natural foods industry.

Reed, the company is located in Los Angeles, California.

Products[edit]
The six Ginger Brew flavors are: Original Ginger, Extra Ginger, Premium Ginger, Raspberry Ginger, Cherry Ginger and Spiced Apple. Reed's Inc. brews its ginger sodas in a microbrew process using filtered sparkling water.[5] The brews contain between 8 and 26 grams of ginger per serving, depending on the product.[5]
Reed's Ginger Brews are made in batches.[5] To read the date a particular batch was brewed, look at the numbers printed directly on the glass at the bottle's neck. At normal room temperature Reed's Ginger brews will last about one and a half years. If kept cold, they will keep much longer.
Reed's, Inc. products are sold in mainstream grocery stores such as Ralphs, Ingles, Kroger, Costco, Fred Meyer and others, including drug and sundries stores, but mainly in health food stores and other specialty food stores such as Whole Foods Market, Cost Plus World Market and Trader Joe's.[6]
In the summer of 2012, Reed's Inc. launched a kombucha line that includes four flavors: Goji Ginger, Cranberry Ginger, Lemon Raspberry Ginger and Hibiscus Grapefruit Ginger.[7]
In 2013, Reed's Inc. developed four new kombucha flavors: Pomegranate Ginger, Passion Mango Ginger, Cabernet and Coconut Water Lime.[8]
Notable events[edit]
Reed's Spiced Apple Brew has won the "Outstanding Beverage Finalist" at the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade.[9] Reed's Original Ginger Brew has won the "Outstanding Beverage Finalist" from the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade.[9] Reed's Original Ginger Brew has won the "Best Imported Food Product" from the Canadian Fancy Food Association.[9]
Virgil's Root Beer won the "Outstanding Beverage" Award at the International Fancy Food and Confection Show in 1994, 1996 and 1997.[9]
In 2008 Reed's, Inc. was ranked 100th in Beverage Industry magazine’s Top 100 list of the largest beverage companies based on worldwide net sales for U.S. companies and foreign-held companies that have significant sales in the United States.[10]
In March 2010 Reed's agreed to purchase rival Jones Soda[11] but later that month Jones Soda backed out of the deal.[12]
Reed's Inc. was selected by WholeFoods Magazine as the Runner Up Beverage Company in the Natural Choice Awards of 2010 and 2011.[13][14]
Reed's Inc. became profitable for the first time as a public company during the second fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2012.[15]

New Product Marries Coffee and KombuchaMarketwiredSeptember 8, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareLOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Sep 8, 2014) - Reed's, Inc. (  NYSE MKT :  REED ) announced today it is adding an organic coffee kombucha to its line-up of Reed's Culture Club Kombucha. The new Coffee Kombucha will be showcased at the upcoming Natural Products Expo in Baltimore September 18th-20th, and will be introduced to store shelves across the country this fall."The kombucha culture is traditionally grown in a tea base. We decided to grow the culture in a coffee base instead and were excited by the results. With 83 percent1 of American adults drinking coffee every day, it made sense for us to marry an organic coffee with our signature long-aged kombucha," said Chris Reed, founder and CEO of Reed's, Inc. "Recently, we had married coconut water and our Kombucha in a new product launch that is now one of our top-selling varieties. We're excited to share this new category innovation with our customers. Our largest distributors have already shown enthusiasm for this new coffee product."Instead of growing the kombucha culture in Oolong and Yerba Mate tea as in the other Reed's Culture Club Kombucha products, this new product is grown in brewed organic coffee. Reed continued, "This proprietary process enhances the already bold kombucha drink and creates a unique, delicious flavor. At Reed's we long-age our kombucha to maximize the flavor and nutritional potential. The Reed's team has conducted dozens of rounds of taste-testing to make this the perfect blend balance."The nine varieties of raw, live and organic Reed's Culture Club Kombucha, as well as the company's other brands, Reed's Ginger Brews and Virgil's Natural Sodas, are sold nationwide in natural food stores and mainstream grocery stores across the country. For details or online ordering, please visit www.reedsinc.com.About Reed's, Inc.  Reed's, Inc. makes the top-selling natural sodas in the natural foods industry and is sold in over 15,000 natural and mainstream supermarkets nationwide. In addition, Reed's products are sold through specialty gourmet, natural food stores, retail stores, convenience stores and restaurants nationwide and select international markets. Its six award-winning non-alcoholic Ginger Brews are unique in the beverage industry, being brewed, not manufactured and using fresh ginger, spices and fruits in a brewing process that predates commercial soft drinks. The Company owns the top-selling root beer line in natural foods, the Virgil's Root Beer product line, and a top-selling cola line in natural foods, the China Cola product line. In 2012, the Company launched Reed's Culture Club Kombucha line of organic live beverages. Other product lines include: Reed's Ginger Candies and Reed's Ginger Ice Creams. The company is celebrating 25 years of hand crafting the best sodas in the world, naturally, in 2014.Follow Reed's on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
