About Us

What’s in a Name?
I got the name foundation from the Bible. It’s referenced there many times about a man building a house on a firm foundation. The house will withstand anything because of how it’s built and what it stands on.
My vision for this company is the same – to build a solid company that can withstand and flourish, no matter what the circumstances. We started the business March 1, 2011. Not exactly a building boom, but a chance to get started and set some small and obtainable goals.
As our footprint has grown, our team has remained true to the original vision set by my original partners, John Gorey and Tom Fischbeck, and me. We will stay focused on servicing our customers, working as a team and partnering with our vendors.
I also want to mention our logo and the cypress tree. I wanted something different than a picture of some tools or drywall and metal studs. The cypress tree is a great memory for us of the Pebble Beach area, as well as a symbol of something that has a firm foundation.
My promise to our customers is we will do business with integrity and honesty, strive to be the best every day and never forget we work for you.
To our team members, the goal has to be the best building material company in the industry. We’ll go above and beyond to service our customers and work as a team to accomplish our goals.
As we grow, our principles will not change. We believe in our strategy and will work hard to be the company of choice in the areas we serve.
Best regards,
Ruben D. Mendoza
President & CEO
Foundation Building Materials LLC

(FBM), the largest specialty  distributor of suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada  and the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard in the United  States and Canada, today reported first quarter 2017 financial results. “2017 is off to a great start as we delivered solid financial and  operational results for the first quarter,” said Ruben Mendoza,  President and CEO of FBM. “Building on last year’s momentum, we continue  to execute our growth strategy and realize benefits from operational  initiatives and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. Following five  acquisitions completed in 2016, we have already completed five  acquisitions in 2017, helping us expand our product offering and our  geographic footprint in attractive markets. The completion of our  initial public offering in February allowed us to improve our capital  structure and positioned us to take advantage of the healthy market  dynamics we anticipate in 2017.”2017 First Quarter Results Net sales were $479.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017,  an increase of 96.0% compared to $244.6 million in the prior year  period. Net sales increased primarily as a result of $197.8 million in  additional net sales provided by acquired branches. Our base business  net sales (net sales from branches that were owned by us since  January 1, 2016 and branches that were opened by us during such period)  increased $23.3 million, or 11.0%, over the prior year period.  Complementary products sales were $119.5 million for the three months  ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 80.0% compared to $66.4 million in  the prior year period. Gross profit was $139.9 million for the three months ended March 31,  2017, an increase of 93.7% compared to $72.2 million in the prior year  period. Gross margin was 29.2% compared to 29.5% in the prior year  period. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the Winroc-SPI  acquisition and the resulting change in product mix, which was partially  offset by a positive contribution from purchasing synergies. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $113.1  million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 99.2%  compared to $56.8 million in the prior year period. SG&A expenses  increased primarily due to the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August of 2016,  our continued investment in infrastructure and support of our operations  as a public company. Warehousing and delivery costs increased by $30.3  million as a result of our higher branch count.   (1)    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See the supplementary  schedules at the end of this press release for a discussion of how  we define and calculate this measure, why we believe it is important  and a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP  measure.          2017 First Quarter One-Time Expenses and  Expected Synergies from Acquisitions of $1.6 Million Management considers one-time expenses and anticipated cost savings in  evaluating the performance of the business. For the three months ended  March 31, 2017, we incurred certain one-time expenses totaling $0.6  million, which primarily included acquisition-related expenses. We also  continued to integrate our acquisition of Winroc-SPI during the quarter,  and believe that $1.0 million of expenses incurred in the three months  ended March 31, 2017 are costs we will eliminate as synergies are  realized.2017 First Quarter Segment ResultsSpecialty Building Products (“SBP”). Net sales were  $418.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of  71.1% compared to $244.6 million in the prior year period. Net sales  were driven by the Winroc-SPI acquisition, which contributed  $111.3 million to the SBP segment during the first quarter of 2017, as  well as growth in the commercial and residential construction markets.  Wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and accessories accounted for the  majority of SBP sales for the period. Gross profit was $122.4 million for the three months ended March 31,  2017, an increase of 69.5% compared to $72.2 million in the prior year  period. Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 29.3%  compared to 29.5% in the prior year period. Gross margin for the three  months ended March 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by the Winroc-SPI  acquisition and the resulting change in product mix, which was partially  offset by a positive contribution from purchasing synergies.Read MoreMechanical Insulation (“MI”). Net sales were $61.0 million  for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We entered the mechanical  insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August  2016, therefore, there were no sales in this segment for the three  months ended March 31, 2016. Gross profit was $17.5 million for the three months ended March 31,  2017, representing a gross margin of 28.7%.AcquisitionsYear-to-date Activity.

(2)    Represents branches consolidated/closed after January 1, 2016,  primarily as a result of our strategic consolidation of branches.  This includes increases in net sales from branches that assumed  operations of closed/acquired branches.    (3)    Represents branches acquired after January 1, 2016.          Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles) Financial Measures In addition to results under GAAP, this press release contains certain  non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which  are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance. These  measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We  calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income  tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate  Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before certain non-recurring adjustments such  as purchase accounting adjustments, IPO expenses, stock-based  compensation, non-cash (gains) losses on the sale of property and  equipment, derivative financial instruments and management fees paid to  private equity sponsors. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important  metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses  financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently  used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate  companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with  related GAAP financial measures, provide investors with an additional  financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our  company and its results of operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations. EBITDA and Adjusted  EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, or as any  other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP.  These measures also should not be construed as an inference that our  future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for  which these non-GAAP measures make adjustments. Additionally, EBITDA and  Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be liquidity measures. Other  companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use such  measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than  we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the  nearest GAAP measure, net income:         Three Months Ended March 31, 2017     (in thousands)          Net income      $  3,929      Interest expense, net      15,214      Income tax expense      2,564      Depreciation and amortization      18,396     EBITDA     40,103                Unrealized non-cash gain on derivative financial instruments      (13,219  )    Initial public offering expenses      2,975      Stock-based compensation      1,553      Non-cash purchase accounting effects(a)      71      Loss on disposal of property and equipment      152      Management fees(b)      353     Adjusted EBITDA     $ 31,988           (a)    Adjusts for the effect of the purchase accounting step-up in the  value of inventory to fair value recognized in cost of goods sold as  a result of acquisitions.    (b)    Represents fees paid to our former private equity sponsor for  services provided pursuant to past management agreements. These fees  are no longer being incurred subsequent to our initial public  offering.   View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170509006616/en/ ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAmazon sales surge, but spending bites into profitAFP'Friends' Cast Admits They Were Sleeping TogetherWifeWineSponsoredChegg (CHGG) Reports Narrower-than-Estimated Loss in Q2ZacksThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredTax cuts just got more likelyYahoo FinanceChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone to punish workers for misconductAssociated PressNorth Korea 2nd ICBM test puts much of US in range: expertsAssociated PressSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoFast food chains are coping with their labor cost problemYahoo FinanceExclusive: Majority of Americans support transgender military serviceBob: How about a poll that asks if tax payers should fund sex change surgery?

        In mid-July, FBM was joined by a host of other walls and ceilings professionals at the FWCCA Annual Convention in Orlando, Florida. The event took place over a 3-day period featuring a range of networking opportunities and industry trainings including educational sessions on 'Non-Metallic Plaster Bases for Stucco Systems' and 'The Evolution of Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS).' In addition to the training opportunities, a group of FWCCA representatives, comprised of distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and contractors led a compelling panel discussion on trends and indicators affecting the Florida construction market. For two days during the convention, attendees gathered in the exhibit hall to learn about the latest in specialty building products. FBM, a key sponsor of the event, exhibited alongside Armstrong Ceilings, STO Corp and Crane Composites. FBM made it a point to increase its brand presence at the event with a new tradeshow exhibit, company literature and product support materials. According to the FWCCA, the cost of the convention continues to remain affordable for even the smallest contractors thanks to the range of participating sponsors.

        In mid-July, FBM was joined by a host of other walls and ceilings professionals at the FWCCA Annual Convention in Orlando, Florida. The event took place over a 3-day period featuring a range of networking opportunities and industry trainings including educational sessions on 'Non-Metallic Plaster Bases for Stucco Systems' and 'The Evolution of Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS).' In addition to the training opportunities, a group of FWCCA representatives, comprised of distributors, manufacturers, suppliers and contractors led a compelling panel discussion on trends and indicators affecting the Florida construction market. For two days during the convention, attendees gathered in the exhibit hall to learn about the latest in specialty building products. FBM, a key sponsor of the event, exhibited alongside Armstrong Ceilings, STO Corp and Crane Composites. FBM made it a point to increase its brand presence at the event with a new tradeshow exhibit, company literature and product support materials. According to the FWCCA, the cost of the convention continues to remain affordable for even the smallest contractors thanks to the range of participating sponsors.

        Foundation Building Materials, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results
      

        May 09, 2017
      



Foundation Building Materials, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Results

Growth Initiatives Continue to Drive Strong Results2017 First Quarter Highlights
        Record revenue of $479.5 million, an increase of 96.0% compared to the
        prior year period
      
        Net income of $3.9 million, including a gain of $13.3 million on a
        derivative, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million in the prior year
        period
      
        Adjusted EBITDA1 of $32.0 million, one-time expenses of
        $1.6 million, for a total of $33.6 million, a margin of 7.0%
      
        On January 1, 2017, acquired Dominion Interior Supply of Virginia
        Completed our initial public offering in February raising $161.3
        million in net proceeds
      TUSTIN, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Foundation Building Materials, Inc. (NYSE:FBM), the largest specialty
      distributor of suspended ceiling systems in the United States and Canada
      and the second largest specialty distributor of wallboard in the United
      States and Canada, today reported first quarter 2017 financial results.
    
      “2017 is off to a great start as we delivered solid financial and
      operational results for the first quarter,” said Ruben Mendoza,
      President and CEO of FBM. “Building on last year’s momentum, we continue
      to execute our growth strategy and realize benefits from operational
      initiatives and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. Following five
      acquisitions completed in 2016, we have already completed five
      acquisitions in 2017, helping us expand our product offering and our
      geographic footprint in attractive markets. The completion of our
      initial public offering in February allowed us to improve our capital
      structure and positioned us to take advantage of the healthy market
      dynamics we anticipate in 2017.”
    2017 First Quarter Results
      Net sales were $479.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017,
      an increase of 96.0% compared to $244.6 million in the prior year
      period. Net sales increased primarily as a result of $197.8 million in
      additional net sales provided by acquired branches. Our base business
      net sales (net sales from branches that were owned by us since
      January 1, 2016 and branches that were opened by us during such period)
      increased $23.3 million, or 11.0%, over the prior year period.
      Complementary products sales were $119.5 million for the three months
      ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 80.0% compared to $66.4 million in
      the prior year period.
    
      Gross profit was $139.9 million for the three months ended March 31,
      2017, an increase of 93.7% compared to $72.2 million in the prior year
      period. Gross margin was 29.2% compared to 29.5% in the prior year
      period. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the Winroc-SPI
      acquisition and the resulting change in product mix, which was partially
      offset by a positive contribution from purchasing synergies.
    
      Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were $113.1
      million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 99.2%
      compared to $56.8 million in the prior year period. SG&A expenses
      increased primarily due to the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August of 2016,
      our continued investment in infrastructure and support of our operations
      as a public company. Warehousing and delivery costs increased by $30.3
      million as a result of our higher branch count.
    
          (1)
        
           
        
          Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. See the supplementary
          schedules at the end of this press release for a discussion of how
          we define and calculate this measure, why we believe it is important
          and a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP
          measure.
        
           
        2017 First Quarter One-Time Expenses and
      Expected Synergies from Acquisitions of $1.6 Million
      Management considers one-time expenses and anticipated cost savings in
      evaluating the performance of the business. For the three months ended
      March 31, 2017, we incurred certain one-time expenses totaling $0.6
      million, which primarily included acquisition-related expenses. We also
      continued to integrate our acquisition of Winroc-SPI during the quarter,
      and believe that $1.0 million of expenses incurred in the three months
      ended March 31, 2017 are costs we will eliminate as synergies are
      realized.
    2017 First Quarter Segment ResultsSpecialty Building Products (“SBP”). Net sales were
      $418.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of
      71.1% compared to $244.6 million in the prior year period. Net sales
      were driven by the Winroc-SPI acquisition, which contributed
      $111.3 million to the SBP segment during the first quarter of 2017, as
      well as growth in the commercial and residential construction markets.
      Wallboard, suspended ceiling systems and accessories accounted for the
      majority of SBP sales for the period.
    
      Gross profit was $122.4 million for the three months ended March 31,
      2017, an increase of 69.5% compared to $72.2 million in the prior year
      period. Gross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 29.3%
      compared to 29.5% in the prior year period. Gross margin for the three
      months ended March 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by the Winroc-SPI
      acquisition and the resulting change in product mix, which was partially
      offset by a positive contribution from purchasing synergies.
    Mechanical Insulation (“MI”). Net sales were $61.0 million
      for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We entered the mechanical
      insulation market as a result of the Winroc-SPI acquisition in August
      2016, therefore, there were no sales in this segment for the three
      months ended March 31, 2016.
    
      Gross profit was $17.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
      2017, representing a gross margin of 28.7%.
    AcquisitionsYear-to-date Activity. We have completed the following
      five acquisitions in 2017:

        Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
      Principles) Financial Measures
      In addition to results under GAAP, this press release contains certain
      non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which
      are provided as supplemental measures of financial performance. These
      measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We
      calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income
      tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization. We calculate
      Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before certain non-recurring adjustments such
      as purchase accounting adjustments, IPO expenses, stock-based
      compensation, non-cash (gains) losses on the sale of property and
      equipment, derivative financial instruments and management fees paid to
      private equity sponsors.
    
      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important
      metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses
      financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently
      used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate
      companies in our industry. These measures, when used in conjunction with
      related GAAP financial measures, provide investors with an additional
      financial analytical framework that may be useful in assessing our
      company and its results of operations.
    
      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations. EBITDA and Adjusted
      EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, or as any
      other measures of financial performance derived in accordance with GAAP.
      These measures also should not be construed as an inference that our
      future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for
      which these non-GAAP measures make adjustments. Additionally, EBITDA and
      Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be liquidity measures. Other
      companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use such
      measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than
      we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
    
      The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the
      nearest GAAP measure, net income:
