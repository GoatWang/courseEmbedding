                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-1HomeMailSearchNewsCricketMoviesLifestyleCelebrityFlickrMobileAnswersMoreYahooSearchSearchSign inIndia Markets closedBSE SENSEX32,309.88-73.42 (-0.23%)Nifty 5010,014.50-6.05 (-0.06%)USD/INR64.110.00 (0.00%)Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-1Business Wire2 December 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions:SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-1 (SLM 2013-1):--Class A-2 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable;--Class B affirmed at 'A+sf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and assigned Outlook Stable.On Nov. 29, 2016, the legal final maturity date of the SLM 2013-1 class A-3 and B notes were extended to May 2055 and November 2070. This effectively mitigates the maturity risk in Fitch's cash flow modelling, resulting in the affirmation. The class B notes pass all credit stresses, but only pass up to the 'BBsf' maturity stresses, due to principal shortfalls at higher rating stresses. Because their maturity date of November 2070 is greater than 54 years away, and the notes are currently rated 'A+sf', they are eligible for the downgrade tolerance of two rating category. This results in the affirmation at 'A+sf'. Fitch assumes $150,000 trustee fee the trust would have to pay at the top of the waterfall if the Administrator fails to pay the Indenture Trustee in its cash flow analysis. Assuming the Administrator performs their duties and pay the fees from the trust, the cash flow model would have an implied rating of 'AA'.KEY RATING DRIVERSU.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral comprises Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans 100%, with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The U.S. sovereign rating is currently rated 'AAA', Outlook Stable by Fitch.Collateral Performance: Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 12.50% and a 37.50% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario. The base case default assumption of 12.50% implies a constant default rate of 3.9% (assuming a weighted average life of 9.6 years) consistent with the trailing 12 month (TTM) average constant default rate utilized in the maturity stresses. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case.The TTM average of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 11.2%, 15.1%, 14.7% and 13.9%, respectively, which are used as the starting point in cash flow modeling. Subsequent declines or increases are modeled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.20%, based on information provided by the sponsor.Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.Payment Structure: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 2016, total and senior effective parity ratios, respectively, are 101.01% (1.00% CE) and 106.24% (5.87% CE). Liquidity support is provided by a reserve account sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and $1,249,779, currently equal to $1,791,018.83. The trust will continue to release cash as long as the target overcollateralization amount of the greater of 1.00% of adjusted pool balance or $2,000,000 is maintained.Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the commensurate rating scenario, subject to the downgrade tolerance described above.Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes Navient to be an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.Criteria VariationUnder the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds', dated Sept. 1, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest are those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested for a short duration given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.Read MoreRATING SENSITIVITIES'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic variables.Credit Stress Rating Sensitivity--Default increase 25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAsf'--Default increase 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'Asf'--Basis Spread increase 0.25%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'--Basis Spread increase 0.50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAAsf'Maturity Stress Rating Sensitivity--CPR decrease 50%: class A 'AAsf'; class B 'CCCsf'--CPR increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'AAsf'--IBR Usage increase 100%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBBsf'--IBR Usage decrease 50%: class A 'AAAsf'; class B 'BBsf'It is important to note that the stresses are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration in trust performance. Rating sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of future rating performance.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 26 Oct 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888492Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan Program Student Loan ABS Criteria (pub. 10 Nov 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889777Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1015789Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1015789Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

EXHIBIT
A


 


CONSENT


 


Each of the undersigned parties
hereby consents, as of November 29, 2016, to the amendment of the
INDENTURE, dated as of February 14, 2013 (the “
Indenture ”), among SLM Student Loan Trust
2013‑1, as Issuer (the “ Issuer ”),
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as eligible lender trustee
(the “ Eligible Lender Trustee ”), and
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as indenture trustee (the
“ Indenture Trustee ”), as amended from
time to time, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex
A.


 


The Indenture is being amended to
amend certain definitions contained therein.


 


Ratings
Considerations :
Each of the undersigned parties understands that no assurance can
be provided regarding the impact that the adoption of the amendment
will have on the ratings of the Notes.  As required by the
Indenture, the Issuer has provided prior written notice of the
terms of the amendment to each Rating Agency currently rating the
Notes.  However, no Rating Agency confirmation or affirmation
of the ratings of the Notes has been sought or given.  As a
result, it is not certain what impact the adoption of the amendment
will have on a Rating Agency’s decision to add the Notes to
or remove the Notes from its negative watch list for possible
downgrade or to downgrade the current ratings of the
Notes.


 


Further, we have been advised that
it is possible that a Rating Agency may view the adoption of this
amendment as a restructuring of a distressed debt instrument. 
One potential result of this designation would be to cause a
ratings downgrade of the Notes (to reflect the distressed debt
element of their analysis) followed by an upgrade of the rating of
the Notes (to address the restructuring of the Notes).


 


U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations :
Each of the undersigned parties understands that the adoption of
the amendment may have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences
to the Noteholders, and the undersigned parties will rely on advice
from their own tax advisors on this matter.  The discussion
below is general in nature and does not address all of the tax
consequences of the adoption of the amendment that may be relevant
to Noteholders.


 


Although we believe that the
adoption of the amendment more likely than not will not adversely
affect the tax characterization of the Notes as indebtedness for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain adverse tax consequences
could apply to holders if the adoption of the amendment resulted in
the Notes being treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.  For a further discussion of the adverse tax
consequences to Noteholders if the Notes were treated as equity for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, see “ U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to Holders of Notes
In General—Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness ”
in the Base Prospectus dated February 4, 2013 (the “
Base Prospectus ”). The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the Notes will constitute indebtedness for
U.S. federal income tax purposes following the adoption of the
amendment.

 







The deferral of the stated maturity
date pursuant to the amendment may be treated as a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
resulting in a deemed exchange.  If the amendment results in a
significant modification and a deemed exchange of “Old
Notes” for “New Notes,” U.S. Noteholders will
recognize gain or loss upon the deemed exchange unless the exchange
qualifies as a tax-free recapitalization.  Although the matter
is not free from doubt, we intend to treat the deemed exchange as
such a recapitalization.  If the deemed exchange is a tax-free
recapitalization, a noteholder’s tax basis in the New Notes
received pursuant to a deemed exchange generally will equal the
holder’s tax basis in the Old Notes.


 


If the amendment results in a
significant modification, the issue price of the New Notes will
depend on whether the New Notes and the Old Notes are properly
characterized as “traded on an established market”
(hereinafter “publicly-traded”) within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. § 1.1273‑2(f)(1).  We expect the New
Class A-3 Notes should be characterized as publicly traded, and we
expect the New Class B Notes should not be characterized as
publicly traded. We expect, and the remainder of this discussion
assumes, that the stated interest on the New Notes will meet the
requirements for “adequate stated interest” under the
Treasury Regulations. Consequently, the issue price of the New
Class A-3 Notes should be the fair market value of the New Class
A-3 Notes on the date of the deemed exchange (i.e., on the date the
amendment becomes effective), and the issue price of the New Class
B Notes should be the “stated principal amount” of the
New Class B Notes.


 


A New Note received in the deemed
exchange will be treated as having been issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
if the New Note’s “stated principal amount”
exceeds the issue price of the New Notes by more than the
statutorily defined de minimis amount.  In light of the
current trading prices for the Notes, there is a significant
likelihood that the New Class A-3 Notes will be treated as
re-issued with OID. For a further discussion of the treatment of
OID, see “ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax
Consequences to Holders of Notes In General—Original Issue
Discount” in the Base Prospectus .


 


If the deemed exchange qualifies as
a recapitalization and a Noteholder’s initial tax basis in
the New Notes exceeds their stated principal amount, the holder
will be considered to have acquired the New Notes with amortizable
bond premium.  In addition, for any Noteholder that acquired
Old Notes with market discount, any gain recognized on the deemed
exchange will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the
market discount accrued during its period of ownership, unless such
holder previously elected to include market discount in income as
it accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Assuming the
deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization, in a deemed
exchange of Old Notes with market discount for New Notes, the New
Notes will be treated as acquired with market discount if the issue
price of the New Notes exceeds the holder’s initial tax basis
for such New Notes by more than a de minimis amount, and any
accrued market discount with respect to the Old Notes generally
should carry over to such New Notes.  For a further discussion
of amortizable bond premium and market discount, see “
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to
Holders of Notes In General—Market Discount ” and
“ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax
Consequences to Holders of Notes In General—Amortizable Bond
Premium ” in the Base Prospectus.

Noteholders are urged to consult
with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the adoption of the amendment.

SLM STUDENT LOAN TRUST

FLOATING RATE CLASS A-3 STUDENT
LOAN-BACKED NOTES


 


SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-1, a
statutory trust organized and existing under the laws of the State
of Delaware (herein referred to as the “Issuer”), for
value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or
registered assigns, the principal sum of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND
NO/100 DOLLARS ($500,000,000) payable on each Distribution Date in
an amount equal to the result obtained by multiplying (i) a
fraction, the numerator of which is $500,000,000 and the
denominator of which is $538,000,000, by (ii) the aggregate amount,
if any, payable to the Class A-3 Noteholders on such Distribution
Date in respect of principal of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.1
of the Indenture dated as of February 14, 2013 (the
“Indenture”), among the Issuer, Deutsche Bank Trust
Company Americas, a New York banking corporation, as Eligible
Lender Trustee on behalf of the Issuer, and Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company, a national banking association, as Indenture Trustee
(the “Indenture Trustee”) (capitalized terms used but
not defined herein being defined in Appendix A to the
Indenture, which also contain rules as to usage that shall be
applicable herein); provided , however , that the
entire unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and
payable on the May 25, 2055 Distribution Date (the “Class A-3
Maturity Date”).


 


The Issuer shall pay interest on
this Note at the rate per annum equal to the Class A-3 Rate (as
defined on the reverse hereof), on each Distribution Date until the
principal of this Note is paid or made available for payment, on
the principal amount of this Note outstanding on the preceding
Distribution Date (after giving effect to all payments of principal
made on the preceding Distribution Date), subject to certain
limitations contained in Section 3.1 of the Indenture. 
Interest on this Note shall accrue from and including the
immediately preceding Distribution Date (or, in the case of the
first Accrual Period, the Closing Date) to but excluding the
following Distribution Date (each an “Accrual
Period”).  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed in each Accrual Period divided by
360.  Such principal of and interest on this Note shall be
paid in the manner specified on the reverse hereof.


 


The principal of and interest on
this Note are payable in such coin or currency of the United States
of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
public and private debts.  All payments made by the Issuer
with respect to this Note shall be applied first to interest due
and payable on this Note as provided above and then to the unpaid
principal of this Note.


 


Reference is made to the further
provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which
shall have the same effect as though fully set forth on the face of
this Note.


 


Unless the certificate of
authentication hereon has been executed by the Indenture Trustee
whose name appears below by manual signature, this Note shall not
be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture referred to on the
reverse hereof, or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose.

Class A-3 (R-1) Note

 







This Note is one of a duly
authorized issue of Notes of the Issuer, designated as its Floating
Rate Class A-3 Student Loan-Backed Notes (the “Class A-3
Notes”), together with the Floating Rate Class A-1 Student
Loan-Backed Notes (the “Class A-1 Notes”) and the
Floating Rate Class A-2 Student Loan-Backed Notes (the “Class
A-2 Notes” and, together with the Class A-1 Notes and the
Class A-3 Notes, the “Class A Notes”) which, together
with the Issuer’s Floating Rate Class B Student Loan-Backed
Notes (the “Class B Notes” and, together with the Class
A Notes, the “Notes”), are issued under and secured by
the Indenture, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective
rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Eligible Lender Trustee and the Noteholders.  The
Notes are subject to all terms of the Indenture.


 


This Note is secured equally and
ratably with the Collateral pledged as security therefore as
provided in the Indenture.  On any Distribution Date, interest
on each Class A Note will be paid pari passu with all other Class A
Notes, and, thereafter, interest on the Class B Notes will be
paid.  On any Distribution Date, the principal on the Class A
Notes will be paid, first, to the Class A-1 Notes; second, to the
Class A-2 Notes; and third, to the Class A-3 Notes, up to the
applicable Class A Noteholders’ Principal Distribution
Amount. Thereafter, on any Distribution Date, principal on the
Class B Notes will be paid to the Class B Notes up to the
applicable Class B Noteholders’ Principal Distribution
Amount.  Payment priorities following the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default will change as
described in the Indenture.


 


Principal of the Class A-3 Notes
shall be payable on each Distribution Date in an amount described
on the face hereof.  “Distribution Date” means the
25th day of each calendar month or, if any such date is not a
Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing March
25, 2013.


 


As described on the face hereof,
the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and
payable on the Class A-3 Maturity Date.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes shall be
due and payable on the date on which (i) an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Indenture Trustee or
the Noteholders representing not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes shall have declared the Notes to be
immediately due and payable in the manner provided in Section 5.2
of the Indenture.  All principal payments on the Class A-3
Notes shall be made pro rata to the Noteholders entitled
thereto.


 


Interest on the Class A-3 Notes
shall be payable on each Distribution Date on the principal amount
outstanding of the Class A-3 Notes until the principal amount
thereof is paid in full, at a rate per annum equal to the Class A-3
Rate.  The “Class A-3 Rate” for each Accrual
Period, other than the initial Accrual Period, shall be equal to
One-Month LIBOR as determined on the second Business Day before the
beginning of that Accrual Period plus 0.55%.  The interest for
the initial Accrual Period shall be as set forth in the definition
of Class A-3 Rate contained in Appendix A to the
Indenture.

 

Class A-3 (R-1) Note

 







If Definitive Notes have been
issued as of the applicable Record Date, then payments of interest
on this Note on each Distribution Date, together with the
installment of principal, if any, to the extent not in full payment
of this Note, shall be made by check mailed to the Person whose
name appears as the Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more
Predecessor Notes) on the Note Register on the Record Date. 
Such checks shall be mailed to the Person entitled thereto at the
address of such Person as it appears on the Note Register as of the
applicable Record Date without requiring that this Note be
submitted for notation of payment, and the mailing of such check
shall constitute payment of the amount thereof regardless of
whether such check is returned undelivered.  With respect to
Notes registered on the applicable Record Date in the name of the
nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede
& Co.), unless Definitive Notes have been issued, payments
shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
the account designated by such nominee.  Any reduction in the
principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor
Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall
be binding upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If
funds are expected to be available, as provided in the Indenture,
for payment in full of the then remaining unpaid principal amount
of this Note on a Distribution Date, then the Indenture Trustee, in
the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, shall notify the Person
who was the Noteholder hereof as of the preceding Record Date by
notice mailed no later than five days prior to such Distribution
Date and the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon
presentation and surrender of this Note at the Indenture
Trustee’s Corporate Trust Office or at the office of the
Indenture Trustee’s agent appointed for such purposes located
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York.


 


The Issuer shall pay interest on
overdue installments of interest on this Note at the Class A-3 Rate
to the extent lawful.


 


As provided in the Indenture and
subject to certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of
this Note shall be registered  on the Note Register upon
surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office
or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, with
such signature guaranteed by an “eligible guarantor
institution” meeting the requirements of the Note Registrar,
which requirements include membership or participation in
Securities Transfer Agent’s Medallion Program
(“STAMP”) or such other “signature guarantee
program” as may be determined by the Note Registrar in
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP (all in accordance with
the Exchange Act), and such other documents as the Indenture
Trustee may require, and thereupon one or more new Notes of
authorized denominations and in the same aggregate principal amount
shall be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. 
No service charge will be charged for any registration of transfer
or exchange of this Note, but the transferor may be required to pay
a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer
or exchange.


 


Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by
acceptance of this Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a
beneficial interest in this Note, covenants and agrees that no
recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the
obligations of the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or
under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing delivered
in connection therewith, against (i) the Indenture Trustee or the
Eligible Lender Trustee in its individual capacity, (ii) any owner
of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or (iii) any partner, owner,
beneficiary, agent, officer, director or employee of the Indenture
Trustee or the Eligible Lender Trustee in its individual capacity,
any holder or owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the
Eligible Lender Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any
successor or assign thereof in its individual capacity, except as
any such Person may have expressly agreed (it being understood that
the Indenture Trustee and the Eligible Lender Trustee have no such
obligations in their individual capacity) and except that any such
partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent
provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock,
unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or
call owing to such entity.

 

Class A-3 (R-1) Note

 







Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by
acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a beneficial
interest in a Note, covenants and agrees that by accepting the
benefits of the Indenture that for all tax purposes, financial
