About Us

▸ Entrepreneurs and business owners have a unique opportunity to raise necessary capital without giving away equity while building a community of brand supporters and customers.
▸ Individuals, regardless of income or net worth, can invest in revenue sharing deals with companies they are excited and passionate about. 
Startwise founders were both working in a Silicon Valley venture capital firm when they realized that there were better alternatives to fund a business. Driven by their passion in investment but being non-accredited investors themselves, they spent their free time brainstorming out-of-the-box investing models - and quit their jobs to build Startwise full time.
Revolutionizing business funding one investment at a time.

Startwise.com is a crowdfunding platform where people and business owners share revenue. We are a funding portal under the Regulation Crowdfunding which enables everyday people to invest in products they love and companies they believe in. For each investment, they receive a share of the company’s revenue every quarter until they reach the investment multiple.

Our funding mechanism provides companies with an alternative way to raise money via a revenue-based loan without giving up ownership. This strategy also helps business owners connect with their community and grow brand loyalty. We focus on companies with consumer products and services such as coffee shops, apparel stores, and benefit corporations.

Startwise.com is a crowdfunding platform where people and business owners share revenue. We are a funding portal under the Regulation Crowdfunding which enables everyday people to invest in products they love and companies they believe in. For each investment, they receive a share of the company’s revenue every quarter until they reach the investment multiple.

Our funding mechanism provides companies with an alternative way to raise money via a revenue-based loan without giving up ownership.

                                    After several discussions with the co-founders, Catherine & Grace, I am fully confident in not only their leadership but also their hustle.  These two are always ready to roll up their sleeves to get more stuff done faster.  A bet on them is a good investment.
