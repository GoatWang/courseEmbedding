David James McFarland



 Whether brokering deals as CEO and Partner of The Lead Company, or interacting with family and friends, David James stays true to the mantra of ‘what you see is what you get.’
This Forest Hills Central grad grew up in Ada, Michigan, and aims to be upfront and honest with everyone he meets. With David, what you see on the outside is what is on the inside.
David is a sports enthusiast who enjoys golf, soccer, and racquetball. He recently earned a degree in Business Management from Cornerstone University to compliment his work experience and background in marketing and organization.
A doting father and husband, David loves spending time with wife Jenna, their daughters Peyton, London, and Adaline, as well as  close family and friends. He enjoys fashion, watches, Apple products, real estate, and projects.
David was honored to be a nominated and eventually selected as 1 of the 40 members of the Grand Rapids Business Journal’s 2011 40 under 40 class. Grand Rapids 40 under 40.
David believes his success derives from a combination of hard work, his ability to think outside the box, strong people-sense, and a basic understanding of everything. He “works to live rather than living to work.”
Successfully balancing an active home life with a thriving business is tough, but in his spare time, David enjoys playing alongside Jenna and friends on the LEADCO soccer team.
His unique ability to easily relate to anyone has helped him be successful in business and life. He quickly credits family, friends, and life experiences for helping to mold and shape him into the man he is today. David proudly insists he “wouldn’t change a thing!”
