            A business needs an EIN in order to pay employees and to file business tax returns. 
            To be considered a Partnership, LLC, Corporation, S Corporation, Non-profit, etc. a business must obtain an EIN. 
            Those business that do not are considered proprietorships and the Owner / Operator SSN is used on any tax documents. 
            Also, financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, and brokerage houses will not open an account for a corporation without an EIN.

If you’re into eating locally and supporting sustainable agriculture, go to Asheville—and eat, eat, eat. This town of less than 100,000 people has 17 farmers’ markets, and the local restaurant scene is all about taking advantage of the seasonal produce sold there. And don’t miss the area’s microbreweries.

Full kitchen and living room with balcony. Much better when we were traveling with our Granddaughters.  I would love to know if these are in other cities.

Family with older children







Robert, Sharpsburg (us) (Sharpsburg, United states of america)





Main reason for choosing The Residences at Biltmore: Rate




                                                                The apt was very clean and super sized. for around the price of two rooms at a cheap hotel, we got an entire apt 2 super bedrooms and2 super baths. Full kitchen and living room with balcony. Much better when we were traveling with our Granddaughters.  I would love to know if these are in other cities.
