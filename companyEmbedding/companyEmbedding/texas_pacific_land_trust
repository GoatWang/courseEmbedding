In Search Of A Price Target For Texas Pacific Land Trust - Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE:TPL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»In Search Of A Price Target For Texas Pacific Land TrustMar.22.17 | About: Texas Pacific (TPL) Steven Miller Growth at reasonable price, value, dividend investing, portfolio strategySteve Miller InkSummaryFinding intrinsic value for the Trust is “tricky” at best.Nevertheless, charts show investors have established a range of prices they are willing to buy at over the past decade.The price target for the Trust is $200-250.The Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE:TPL) is not your typical company. It produces no products. It provides no services. Its only real asset is land, much of it dry, arid, and not very habitable. The Trust has been selling off that land since 1888, yet it remains one of the largest land owners in Texas. It spends its cash primarily on buying and retiring shares-called "sub-shares"-in addition to paying a very small dividend. It is too small for most portfolio managers, but it has been one of the hottest stocks on the market. It could be had for $30 as recently as 2010, and it hit $300 in 2016. What's it Really Worth? Ask an investor what the stock is really worth, and you will get a shrug. Donald Hodges of Hodge Financial told Business Insider in August of 2014, "Mathematically, to me it's just one of those stocks where you can't really say what it's worth, but you know it's worth a lot, and you just better hang on for the ride." In a recent Seeking Alpha article, Eric Sprague wrote in an understatement, "The TPL valuation is tricky." In an even more recent article, contributor Antao echoed that. He wrote, "TPL is a hard company to value." He continued, "putting any meaningful price tag on the land is impossible." Part of the problem assessing the Trust's value is that it is a passive seller of land. Sales of land totaled $22,616,635 in 2015, the highest in the Trust's history, but were $3,698,312 the year before. The income from land sales simply cannot be predicted year to year. The largest source of income in recent years have been from pipeline easements. Sprague showed that these have risen from $1,565,581 in 2007 to $31,413,158 in 2015. Then there was the announcement just last September from Apache Corporation (NYSE:APA) of a significant new discovery they call "Alpine High." The Trust's stock price, which had just doubled, went from under $200 to more than $300 in less than two months. Clearly the Alpine High discovery is a game changer, but no one knows what the game will look like once it has changed.
 In his article, Antao showed a correlation between stock price and book value, but some commenters argued that book value is the wrong metric. The Trust holds land that is given zero value, but some of it is worth a good deal more than that. The point is a fair one, and yet the correlation in Antao's charts remain. I believe metrics such as book value over price, and considerations of future value, both have gravitational pulls on the stock price, but in opposite directions. What's an investor to do? Nearly everyone agrees the stock is intrinsically worth more than it is today, but does that mean investors should buy in at any price today? As of this writing, the stock price has come down nearly 20% from its high of $336.83. I do not know of any investors who enjoy paying 20% extra for their shares, and believe in waiting for a better price when it can be had. What is a Good Price? While Antao was writing his article, I was puzzling about alternate valuations of the stock, in an effort to find a good price to buy in. I started with evaluating free cash flow against enterprise value-FCF/EV-over the period of a decade. The results were similar to Antao's comparison of book value at against market price. The graph I created from the figures confirmed my suspicion that the stock was overvalued at the end of 2016, when the price closed at $336.83: 

 I tried projecting a ratio for 2017 based on FCF/EV, but cash flows being what they are for the company, I had no confidence of projecting them. I then used a tool from the value investor's toolbox-NCAV to Market. This might seem to be a rather unusual metric to use, but consider that the calculation uses current assets, which are known for the Trust, instead of total assets, which is unknown. In addition, the Trust has been aggressively retiring its shares, and the stock price has rocketed over the past year. The NCAV to Market takes both share count and stock price into account. The calculation typically includes debt and preferred shares, but since the Trust has neither, they can be disregarded. The calculation becomes elegantly simple, and similar to the calculation for price/book value:
 Current Assets - Total Liabilities/Shares * Share Price  While the ratio spiked high in 2015, it remained within trends in 2016, even given the high market price: 

 To project the NCAV for 2017, I made the following assumptions: I expect that the Trust will continue to buy back its sub-shares. It bought back 2% of its sub-shares in 2016 and in 2014, and so I projected 2% will be bought back in 2017. Current Assets have been climbing since 2012, and an incremental increase for 2017 seemed appropriate there. I further assumed Total Liabilities will remain flat compared to the prior year, in keeping with trends in prior years: 

 Finally, if I project a price of $250, the NCAV ratio continues to follow its pattern: 

 $250 has a little bit of technical support as well. The stock price dropped to $250 last November, after running up past $300 for the first time the month prior: 


 TPL data by YCharts Based on historic P/Es and an adjusted FY2016 EPS of $5, Antao wrote, "TPL is worth between $100 and $200 per share certificate." Finding support for $100 is difficult based on NCAV, but if I adjust my assumptions lower, I can find support for $200. Conclusion While using NCAV to Market to project a stock price is somewhat unorthodox, it is also true that the Trust is not exactly an orthodox company. The stock probably has an intrinsic value of more than $250/share, but $200-250 is in line within range of investors have paid for the company over the past decade, based on the NCAV to Market metric.

Texas Pacific Land Trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) is a publicly traded land trust with its administrative office in Dallas, Texas. Owning well over 900,000 acres (3,600 km2) in 20 West Texas counties, TPL is among the largest private landowners in the state of Texas.

History[edit]
TPL was created in February 1888 in the wake of the Texas and Pacific Railway bankruptcy, as a means to dispose of the T&P's vast land holdings. TPL received over 3.5 million acres (14,000 km²), and certain T&P bondholders were allowed to exchange their (now worthless) bonds for trust certificates. The certificates were later divided into "sub-share" certificates (3,000 sub-share certificates is the equivalent of one trust certificate), and the sub-share certificates have been traded on the NYSE since January 1927.
Current operations[edit]
Over 100 years later, even having sold 75 percent of its original landholdings, TPL is still among the largest private landowners in the State of Texas. As of December 31, 2008, TPL owned 963,248.33 acres (3,898.1277 km2) of land in 20 West Texas counties, of which around 70 percent is located in Culberson (315,640.09 acres), Reeves (194,750.28 acres), and Hudspeth (160,467.44 acres) counties. In addition, TPL owns a 1/128 nonparticipating perpetual royalty interest in 85,413.60 acres (over half of which is in Ector and Midland counties, and a 1/16 nonparticipating perpetual royalty interest in 386,987.70 acres (over 60 percent of which is in Culberson and Reeves counties).[1]
Trust income is derived from land sales, oil and gas royalties, grazing and sundry leases, interest on notes receivable, and interest on investments.[2] The trust does not actively seek to sell its landholdings, and on rare occasions actually purchases land. (It last did so in 2008, acquiring 640 acres (2.6 km2) from the State of Texas in a parcel adjacent to existing holdings.)
Sub-share Buy Back Policy[edit]
TPL has a long-standing policy to repurchase sub-shares with excess cash. As noted in the 2015 annual report, "As provided in Article Seventh of the Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, establishing the Trust, it will continue to be the practice of the Trustees to purchase and cancel outstanding certificates and sub-shares. These purchases are generally made in the open market and there is no arrangement, contractual or otherwise, with any person for any such purchase."[3]
In 2015, the Trust purchased and retired 204,335 sub-shares at a cost of $28,771,073, representing an average cost of $140.80 per sub-share. The number of sub-shares purchased and retired in 2015 amounted to 2.5% of the total number of sub-shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014.[4]
The policy of buy backs has reduced the sub-share count by 26% between 2004 and 2015 (from 10,971,375 at the end of 2004[5] to 8,118,064[6] at the end of 2015.)

One Of The Hottest Stocks On The NYSE Is A Company Most Of Us Have Never Heard Of — And It's Got An Incredible Backstory

Business Insider/Skye Gould



  The Texas Pacific Land Trust has traded under ticker symbol TPL
  since ticker tape was an emerging technology. But at a time when
  billions of shares change hands every day and a high-frequency
  head start measured in milliseconds can be enough to game the
  system, few on Wall Street have ever heard of it.


  That’s their loss.


  With a colorful history peopled with scheming robber barons,
  corrupt politicians, wildcat oilmen, farsighted hedge funders,
  and one rebel heiress, TPL is currently outpacing 99% of the
  stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Its operating
  margins are orbiting near the stratosphere: around 90%, compared
  with 30% for Apple, Inc.


  A share purchased in August 2009 for $30 would today go for $170
  — for an average annual growth rate of of 41%.


  This year alone, the stock is up 73%. Not bad compared with the
  increase of .68% we’ve seen in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
  (which doesn’t include TPL) during the same period.




Business Insider



  The Trust is a highly atypical company, and not only in
  terms of its financial performance. It manufactures no products
  and provides no services. It has never released a killer app or
  built a game-changing innovation, and it controls no patents. It
  maintains no factories, facilities, equipment, machinery, or
  inventory, nor does it carry any other meaningful expenses, aside
  from eight employees occupying a modest 27th-floor suite in a
  bland office tower in Dallas’ City Center. It has no competitors,
  no liabilities, and no debt. Its chief asset — land, lots of land
  — is finite and tends to steadily, reliably increase in value
  over time, that is, until someone figures out a way to suck out
  more oil, at which point it goes bananas.


  TPL’s only real goal is to maximize returns while gradually
  liquidating its assets.


  “Imagine the PowerPoint presentation,” muses Louis Geser, chief
  analyst for White Space marketing and an independent microcap
  analyst, who began purchasing TPL when it was around $35. “You
  could list what this company does on one hand, and it’s on
  autopilot.”


  Not exactly, says David Peterson, the Trust's CEO, who along with
  his team is kept pretty busy making real estate deals and keeping
  an eye on the accounts receivable. "It's not as sleepy as it once
  was, that's for sure, sir," he says.

  TPL’s assets aren’t much to look at. Just mile after dusty mile
  of bone-dry, mostly featureless desert and grassland, studded
  with creosote and acacia shrubs, stretching forever across the
  empty expanse of West Texas. The Trust has its origins in 1871,
  when the State of Texas and the U.S. government, eager to spur
  the construction of the Texas Pacific Railway, proffered a
  massive land grant — or what some might call a giveaway. With the
  land as collateral, the railroad financed its construction by
  selling nearly $9 million in bonds to the public. Several years
  later, it went bankrupt, and in 1888 it began liquidating parcels
  to satisfy those investors.


  It’s been a very drawn-out process.


  “Yep, we’re going out of business,” TPL’s former manager, Roy
  Thomas, joked in a 2005 interview with The Dallas Morning News.
  “It’s just taking us a while.”


  What began as more than 3.4 million acres has now been pared down
  to 911,216, and Peterson seems in no hurry to dispose of the
  rest. “If the trustees were to receive an offer, they would
  consider it,” he tells Business Insider. “In the meantime, the
  race has started, and we’re pointed in the direction of the
  finish line.” He laughs. “Of course, no one knows how far that
  finish line is exactly....”   


  That’s just fine with TPL’s stockholders, who tend to be among
  the most patient of investors.

  The Trust has a few sources of cash flow. In addition to slowly
  liquidating its holdings — an acre here, an acre there, usually
  buildable parcels near towns or cities — it derives some modest
  income from grazing rights and wind farms, receives surface
  damages from pipelines and other infrastructure, and earns
  royalties from oil found in shale formations miles below the
  surface. Currently, the latter revenue stream is by far the most
  lucrative due to the boom in fracking and other secondary
  recovery methods, which have unleashed significant reserves in
  areas that were abandoned by Big Oil decades ago.


  But even without that recent windfall, TPL would be a highly
  appealing investment. The Trust spends its cash two different
  ways: It distributes a small fraction to shareholders in the form
  of dividends (at a current yield of .27%), and it systematically
  repurchases and retires outstanding shares. As a result, there
  are fewer of those out there all the time.


  Donald Hodges, chairman of Hodges Capital, which counts oilman
  turned financier T. Boone Pickens among its clients, has been in
  the stock for decades and currently owns more than 6% of the
  Trust. “Mathematically, to me it’s just one of those stocks where
  you can’t really say what it’s worth,” Hodges says, “but you know
  it’s worth a lot, and you just better hang on for the ride.”


   


  And Then There Was One

  Back in 1904, The New York Times ran an 
  article in its financial pages taking note of the Texas
  Pacific Land Trust’s novel approach to doing business. Even then
  it was clear that by canceling its liabilities more quickly than
  it disposed of its assets, TPL represented a uniquely lucrative
  proposition for a patient investor. “It has been possible by the
  sale of a small portion of the trust’s lands to buy for
  cancellation a much larger percentage of the outstanding
  certificates,” the article explained, noting that in just four
  years, the float (or outstanding shares) had been reduced by 21%
  through the sale of just 5% of the land.


  It was, The Times declared, “the acme of financiering.”


  Nearly a century later, in 1995, hedge fund manager Murray Stahl
  came to a similar conclusion. A “Contrarian Research Report”
  released by his fund, Horizon Asset Management, 
  described a little-known stock that was “slowly but steadily
  buying itself out of public ownership.


  “Although this process has been ongoing for over a century,” the
  fund reported, “it may now have reached a point at which this
  dynamic begins to naturally accelerate …” Predicting that within
  a decade, “the company’s assets could become concentrated in the
  hands of a few share owners,” the report concluded that seeing as
  how the shares represented 1 million acres of Texas land, “the
  magnitude of this accumulation of per-share value could be
  extraordinary.”


  The price of a share at that point was a reasonable $20. Factor
  in subsequent stock splits, and anyone who followed Stahl’s
  counsel would have turned that $20 into $1044, for an increase of
  5120%. Horizon, now Horizon Kinetics, took its report to heart.
  While Stahl and his colleagues declined to speak with Business
  Insider for this article, public filings show that the company’s
  position in TPL is now around 1.5 million shares, worth around
  $200 million.


  The guy that ends up with the last shares is going to be a rich
  son of a gun


   A full decade after that
  first report, the stock underwent a notable adjustment, losing a
  third of its value in just two months. But when Horizon released
  a follow-up report in 2005, the fund was if anything more
  bullish, describing the precipitous price drop as a win for
  stockholders, because the cheaper the stock, the faster the trust
  could repurchase the outstanding shares, driving up the value of
  those that remained.


  “If you’re a long-term shareholder, you almost want the price to
  decline,” notes Eric Marshall, portfolio manager for Hodges
  Capital, who has been tracking TPL for decades. “The lower the
  stock price, the more shares get bought back, the more acres you
  own per share at the end.”


  Further, as Horizon pointed out, the more shares the Trust owns,
  the less it has to pay out in dividends, leaving still bigger
  piles of cash lying around to purchase more shares.


  Donald Hodges, who recently celebrated his 80th birthday, puts it
  succinctly: “The guy that ends up with the last shares is going
  to be a rich son of a gun.” Generally speaking, he adds, TPL’s
  business model is “about as good of an equation as I’ve seen
  since I’ve been in this business, which is 54 years. I haven’t
  found a negative to it yet.”


  There is, perhaps, no company quite like it in the world. “They
  don’t even have to be successful as a business,” Louis Geser
  marvels. “All they have to do is keep doing what they’ve been
  doing for 125 years.”


  By that reading, the mineral royalties that have been pouring
  into TPL’s bank accounts of late are just the slimy, black icing
  on the cake. Oil has painted the sands of West Texas more than
  once in the past century, spawning corporate empires and
  political dynasties (the Bush family is one), winners and losers,
  and boom towns that blossom overnight then tip into a steep
  decline when the pump jacks start sputtering.


  But fracking or no, TPL has quietly been making its investors
  wealthy for more than a century. All because of one big bet that
  went very, very bad — back when the country was young, capitalism
  was practiced with bare-knuckled zeal, oversight was virtually
  nonexistent, and land seemed all but limitless.


   


  Making Tracks

  the railhead.

  In the mid-19th century, the idea of building a railroad through
  Texas and on to California was more than a compelling business
  proposition. It would be “the greatest commercial achievement, in
  art and science, contributed by the intellect and enterprise of
  man upon the globe,” in the words of one 
  well-respected commentator of the era.


  Listen closely and you can hear the same lofty Utopian spirit
  that still sets pulses racing in today's Silicon
  Valley: the ardent faith
  in the power of technology to bring people together and ultimately
  redeem them. The railroad would, as we say these days, make the
  world a better place.


  “It would form a connecting link between nations and peoples, by
  affording communication between the continents, islands, rivers, zones,
  climates, seas and gulfs,” the writer went on. “It would unite
  the old with the new, the Latin blood with the Saxon, the present
  with the future, lift ignorance into the sphere of intelligence
  and power, and give to the peoples of the world a new life full
  of prosperity and promise.”


  It’s a familiar idea — deploying a disruptive new networking
  technology to make life easier, increase communication, and
  expand horizons. In this case, the new technology was a railroad,
  the Texas & Pacific, and the goal of the pitch was to
  persuade the government to help finance its construction.

  Grandiose though the author’s language may sound today, it
  reflects the spirit of the Reconstruction era. Manifest destiny,
  as the nation’s imperialist impulses were then earnestly called,
  was still a heady, blood-stirring notion for many Americans. The
  nation’s fragility had recently been illustrated by the
  devastating loss of 750,000 soldiers (and an unknown number of
  civilians), during the Civil War, which had only just ended a few
  years before.


  It would form a connecting link between nations and peoples, by
  affording communication between the continents, islands, rivers,
  zones, climates, seas and gulfs ...


  The executives of the Texas & Pacific Railway were not ones
  to soft-pedal the scheme’s potential. “Prosperous communities of
  farmers, and thriving towns inhabited by intelligent mechanics,
  manufacturers and traders, will spring up like magic,” they
  
  promised. “School houses and churches will everywhere adorn
  infant towns and incipient cities, and civilization will take
  firm and permanent root in what is now but a wilderness.”


  Another contemporary advocate reeled off 
  a long list of more practical benefits, from promoting the
  settlement of the West and “intercourse with the Indian tribes”
  to increasing frontier security, facilitating military transport,
  spurring trade with Asia, and bringing “the lights of American
  civilization to regions remote and hitherto involved in the
  darkness of pagan idolatry and imperial despotism.”


  Meanwhile, failing to build the railroad, its proponents warned,
  could have dire consequences, including the possible secession of
  California and Oregon. “Who can doubt that a new republic will
  grow up on the shores of the Pacific, which would perhaps …
  obtain supremacy of [its] own,” one observer 
  suggested ominously.





texaspacificrailway.org




  The railroad’s partisans marshaled another argument to pry more
  subsidies out of the Texas legislature and the U.S. Congress —
  and it too has echoes in today’s tech industry. A southern route
  to the Pacific was needed to counteract the monopoly that had
  sprung up to the North, where the Central and Union Pacific
  railroads had created a
  stranglehold on interstate commerce and transport. This rationale
  was an especially compelling one for Southerners, still reeling
  economically from the war (not to mention the new labor costs
  brought about by the abolition of slavery) and eager to wrest
  their fates from the clutches of Northern robber barons.


  So what if getting the railroad built meant a massive transfer of
  the public domain into private hands? “It was worth 25 cents an
  acre,” Louis Geser says. “There wasn’t seismic data on the
  property. No one knew there was oil in tight seams that could be
  accessed 100 years later by fracking. It was just an asset to
  give away to incent people to build a railroad to move goods.”


  The Texas & Pacific Railway (T&P), which received its
  Congressional charter in 1871, wasn’t the first effort to build a
  railroad across Texas. One attempt, which brought its backers 18
  million acres of Texas state lands, ended in failure with just
  six miles of railway completed. The property was turned over to a
  receiver, eventually becoming the basis of T&P’s land grant.
  In exchange for building the portion of the railroad that would
  connect Texas to San Diego — passing through New Mexico, Arizona,
  and California — Congress kicked in 16 million more acres in
  those territories. And T&P’s acquisition of two smaller Texas
  railroads added many millions on top of that.

  By 1873, the T&P — under the able leadership of Col. Thomas
  A. Scott, also a vice president of the powerful Pennsylvania
  railroad and a would-be robber baron himself — had cobbled
  together one of the most impressive land grants in history,
  larger than the state of Massachusetts. The land was considerably
  more than was necessary to situate the railroad tracks,
  intentionally so. The idea was to sell it off piecemeal to
  settlers to finance construction.


  Such subsidies were all the rage in those days. In total, as much
  as 10 percent of the country was handed over to railroads and
  other interests, a Gilded Age free-for-all that the Pulitzer
  Prize-winning historian Vernon Louis Parrington dubbed “the
  Great Barbecue” — a grand banquet laid out by the federal
  government, at which the nation’s wealthiest citizens made
  gluttons of themselves. “Congress had rich gifts to bestow,”
  Parrington wrote in 1927. “The eating and drinking went on …
  until only the great carcasses were left. Then at last came the
  reckoning. When the bill was sent in to the American people the
  farmers discovered they had been put off with the giblets while
  the capitalists were consuming the turkey.”


  Still, T&P’s generous helping was not secured without
  considerable lobbying, log-rolling, and probably outright theft,
  as detailed in “Reunion
  and Reaction” by the late Yale historian C. Vann Woodward.
  One scheme engineered by Scott and his colleagues involved the
  creation of a construction company — its primary stockholders
  consisting of themselves, their cronies, and, it was alleged,
  numerous members of Congress — which was then handed all the
  railroad’s construction contracts, a sweetheart deal with
  guaranteed profits.


  Still, the land grants came with conditions: Work would have to
  be completed on a set timetable, or the property would be
  returned to the public domain. Mindful of its deadlines, T&P
  quickly set to work selling bonds and laying track. In an early
  annual report, Scott assured bondholders that the board “saw no
  reason why the entire line shall not be finished within a period
  of five years.”


   


  The End of the Line

  Obstacles began 
  piling up almost immediately. First, an untimely lack of
  rainfall rendered the Red River impassable, which meant supplies
  had to be hauled overland. Then, in the spring of 1873, the
  workers were beset by an epidemic of yellow fever.


  Most devastating of all was the stock market panic of 1873, when
  the bank Jay Cooke & Co. went under, taking the whole U.S.
  economy — as well as many European economies — with it and
  contributing to a “Great Depression” that lasted years.


  Scott, by this time known as the Railroad King, sought extensions
  and further government subsidies, using every means at his
  disposal, from 
  providing elected officials with free passage on the various
  lines under his control to initiating a lobbying campaign so
  aggressive it raised eyebrows in the media. “Of course, there are
  the pamphlets printed, and dinners eaten, and the usual
  consumption of champagne,” The Times wrote when one massive
  T&P bailout came up for a vote. “Congressmen are classified,
  as an entomologist arranges his bugs before pinning them in
  frames … and any Senator or Representative who ventures to
  question the claim of Mr. Thomas Scott to receive this subsidy …
  is at once argued with, cajoled, threatened or persuaded.”


  Despite these efforts, Scott’s entreaties met with increasing
  skepticism. One bid for a time extension, in 1880, turned into a
  scandal when a whistleblower named James A. George 
  submitted a letter to a House committee accusing T&P
  officials of having committed “bribery and fraud” in procuring
  its original charter. Promising documentary proof, he alleged
  that the company’s executives had paid “over 30 members of
  Congress” a total of nearly $300,000 for their votes.


  The evidence was never forthcoming, and a few years later a House
  member claimed to have paid George $300 (a relative bargain) “to
  keep his mouth shut.” Regardless of whether George’s claim had
  any basis in fact, there is little doubt that fraud and
  corruption were par for the course in the late 19th century and
  beyond. “Those sorts of charges appeared constantly, and they
  were probably all true,” says Randolf Campbell, professor of
  history at the University of North Texas. “In that age, anything
  went. These guys were all such wheeler-dealers. It’s just
  astonishing the sort of shenanigans they got away with.”

  Because of T&P’s failure to build the requisite track, even
  after a five-year-extension, the company was forced to relinquish
  the 15 million acres granted by the Federal government in New
  Mexico, Arizona, and California — but not before its leaders
  cooked up a deal to transfer the property to the California-based
  Southern Pacific Railroad, which in the meantime had managed to
  lay down track from San Diego to Texas along the same route the
  T&P once hoped to use. The deal would have been, The New York
  Times declared in a 
  1885 editorial, “one of the most audacious swindles ever
  attempted upon the Government of the United States.”


  Scott had meanwhile been replaced by Jay Gould, the widely
  reviled railroad tycoon and stock speculator, who had managed to
  complete the Texas portion of the T&P, securing much of the
  land grant originally offered by the state of Texas.


  Alas, as the T&P’s empty rail cars began rattling across the
  mostly uninhabited scrub land of West Texas, it quickly became
  evident that, for the time being at least, the “prosperous
  communities of farmers” promised by the railroad’s founders had
  failed to materialize.


   


  A Hard Row to Hoe

  Jefferson, Texas, in 1903.

  The Southern Pacific scheme was eventually thwarted, and
  T&P’s subsequent return of more than 15 million federal acres
  to the public domain goes down as the largest land grant
  forfeiture in history. But the railroad was still left more than
  3.4 million Texas acres to play with when it went belly up and
  was forced into receivership. In a reorganization plan, shares in
  the Trust, valued at $100 each, were issued in exchange for the
  original railroad bonds. Each stock certificate represented 100
  shares — and a board of trustees set about liquidating the land.


  Doing so proved difficult, at least initially. Despite the
  T&P’s aggressive sales pitch to settlers a decade before —
  when it promised that “those who earliest avail themselves of the
  unrivaled advantages of cheap lands and eligible situations,
  will, of course, reap the largest reward” — immigrants who took
  the bait were met with dire challenges.


The great-grandparents of
  President Lyndon B. Johnson were among those early Texas
  settlers. In the biography “
The
  Path to Power
,” Robert A.
  Caro chronicled how within just a few years poor management of
  livestock and an ignorance of the science of crop rotation
  quickly 
transformed
  what appeared to be a fertile arcadia into an unforgiving desert.
   


  “It had taken centuries to create the richness of the Hill
  Country,” Caro wrote. “In two decades or three after man came
  into it, the richness was gone …" On their arrival, the landscape
  was covered with grass, but as the planting seasons went by,
  farmers and cattlemen realized that under a small layer of rich
  soil, “it was a land of stone ... and the implications of that
  fact had become clear.”


  As word got out, TPL ran into difficulty selling off its holdings
  — a circumstance that would prove auspicious to those who held
  onto their stock certificates. At that very moment, it just so
  happened, German inventor Karl Benz was perfecting the
  gasoline-powered automobile, and within a few decades, oil would
  begin gushing from that barren “land of stone,” making a lot of
  Texans very wealthy.


   


  The Case of the Missing Stock Certificate





Alice De Lamar, age 5.

New York Social
  Diary





  Sometime in the waning days of the 19th century, as the Texas
  & Pacific railroad bonds were being converted into shares in
  the land trust, one of the stock certificates went missing. This
  was Certificate No. 390.


  In the ensuing decades, as its value ballooned, the missing
  certificate became the subject of several lawsuits on behalf of
  heirs of the long-defunct New York brokerage firm that had
  handled the transaction. As Max Hensley, president of the
  International Bond and Share Society, 
  recounted in the journal Scripophily, the tale of the lost
  certificate became legendary. “The story appeared in Reader’s
  Digest and constituted a whole radio program by Art Linkletter,”
  he wrote. “Needless to say, all this pot stirring yielded a fine
  cornucopia of crackpots and delusional hopefuls.”


  Courts continually ruled in favor of the Trust, however, and for
  years the shares went unclaimed, and the annual dividends were
  placed in escrow.


  But in the mid 1970s, one Jack Lewin, a retired Chicago trade
  magazine editor with a penchant for digging through dusty library
  boxes to track down old stock certificates (for $15 apiece and a
  30% cut of whatever proceeds he could recover), developed an
  obsessive interest in No. 390.


  It eventually turned up in the archives of the Wells Fargo Bank,
  where it had sat moldering for 75 years. The stock, it soon
  transpired, had been given to the Dutch mining industrialist
  Joseph Raphael De Lamar in consideration of a $15,000 loan he’d
  made to a man named Joseph Decker.


  Originally valued at $10,000, the certificate didn’t even cover
  the balance.


  De Lamar was an interesting character. Born in Holland, he stowed
  away on a merchant ship as a boy, eventually becoming a sea
  captain and making his first of several fortunes salvaging
  shipwrecks. In later years, he entered the mining business, but
  his use of cyanide to mine gold, although wildly effective, was
  also devastating to the health of his employees. Many of De
  Lamar’s miners lasted only a year on the job before succumbing to
  silicosis from the “Deadly
  Delamar Dust,” as it was called. According to historian
  Arthur H. Clark, as many as 500 men gave their lives to create De
  Lamar’s mining fortune.

  Consulate.

  Some of the fruits of that sacrifice can still be seen at 37th
  and Madison Avenue in New York, where De Lamar erected a
  Beaux-Arts mansion, one of the most opulent in the city, for his
  beloved daughter, Alice. It now serves as the Polish consulate.


  When Joseph died in 1918, leaving Alice half of his $20 million
  fortune, the society press was breathless with speculation about
  her romantic life. But Alice ditched the Madison Avenue
  residence, along with a palatial estate in Glen Cove, Long
  Island. She spurned her various aristocratic suitors and seemed
  embarrassed by her vast fortune (perhaps she had an inkling of
  where it came from), leading 
  one newspaper to dub her “The Girl Who Can’t Get Away From
  Her Millions.” In later years, she became a patron of the arts
  and a friend to Ernest Hemingway, Paul Cadmus, Benny Goodman,
  Hubert de Givenchy, and many other of the day’s most prominent
  cultural figures.


  Eventually, Jack Lewin tracked her down in Palm Beach,
  where the 82-year-old society doyenne and gallery owner lived
  with her longtime lover, the actress and theater producer Eva Le
  Gallienne, in a Spanish-style beachfront estate. By then,
  Certificate No. 390 was worth $5.7 million (half of which went to
  charity, per Joseph’s wishes). For Alice, who had no surviving
  relatives, the unexpected windfall was most likely a meaningless
  addition to an accursed inheritance she never wanted in the first
  place.


  It's not known whether Lewin collected any of his anticipated 30%
  commission.


   


  Going Back for Seconds

  the Permian High School football stadium.

  The Permian Basin, a massive oil formation in West Texas and
  Southeastern New Mexico, was first drilled in the twenties, not
  long after Joseph De Lamar’s death. Before long, shares of TPL
  
  exploded, becoming for a time the highest priced securities
  listed on the NYSE.


  By 1983, the reserves were tapped out — or they might as well
  have been. There was more oil down there; nobody doubted that.
  But amid a worldwide glut, it was too hard to reach and too
  costly to mess with. Big oil producers packed up and made for
  greener pastures — the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, West
  Africa, South America. Pumps were capped, oilfield workers
  drifted into other lines of work, if they could find work at all,
  and former boom towns like Midland and Odessa took on a haunted
  cast, their rusting derricks standing as forlorn monuments to a
  swaggering era.


  For two decades, TPL stock never crept past $10.  


  Cruise down the once empty I-20 between Midland and Odessa today
  and — well, you can’t. The lines of wide-load semis and oil
  tankers, Mercedes GL-class SUVs, and jacked-up Denalis, stretch
  for miles. Traffic accidents are routine, with an average of one
  fatality per week. Housing is impossible to come by, unless you
  want to bunk in a “man
  camp.” Years after the members-only Petroleum Club became a
  hangout for old-timers reliving the glories of the the 1970s oil
  embargo, there’s now 
  a wait for lunchtime tables. Per capita income in Midland is
  second in the nation.


  New “breastaurants” are 
  opening their doors.


  Chalk it up to the development of hydraulic fracking and
  horizontal drilling. There are more rigs operating in the Permian
  Basin today than there were when J.R. Ewing took two
  bullets to the gut.


  By some estimates, 
  as many as 70 billion barrels of oil are sitting down there,
  trapped between the layers of shale — more than they have in
  Kuwait.


  And Texas Pacific Land Trust still has the title to a great big
  chunk of it, and perpetual mineral rights to a good bit more.


  Which explains why its stock price is on such a steep uphill
  ride.


  So why hasn’t anyone heard of it?


  There are more rigs operating in the Permian Basin today than
  there were when J.R. Ewing took two bullets to the gut


  “That’s what I love about it,” Donald Hodges says. “It’s under
  the radar. If you asked 1,000 investors, I’d be surprised if 5
  knew about it. It’s not a candidate for any investment banking.
  It doesn’t owe any money. It’s being ignored by the Wall Street
  industry.”


  “When the receptionist told me a journalist was calling,” Eric
  Marshall tells Business Insider, “I thought you might have the
  symbol wrong.”


  Ultimately, TPL is just too difficult to classify and too small
  for most portfolio managers to take notice of. It doesn’t appear
  on any stock index, and only 11,000 shares change hands per day
  on average.


  “You can find the most beautiful collector’s item in the world,”
  Louis Geser observes, “but if you’re a portfolio manager and you
  can’t take a meaningful position in it, why bother?”


  Of course, that still leaves plenty of room for individual
  investors.


  At this point, only one factor might emerge to slow TPL’s rise,
  and that’s this little thing called climate change. Whether the
  frackers will actually manage to blast all that oil out of the
  ground before carbon taxes and new regulations turn it into a
  “stranded
  asset” — or Elon Musk consigns Karl Benz’s combustion engine
  to the scrap yard of history — is a question that probably
  doesn’t get asked a lot around the Petroleum Club.


  Not that the possibility worries TPL’s fans. Land in Texas will
  always have some value. They’re not making any more of it, after
  all.

Texas Pacific Land Trust

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE: TPL) is a publicly traded land trust with its administrative office in Dallas, Texas. Owning well over 900,000 acres (3,600 km2) in 20 West Texas counties, TPL is among the largest private landowners in the state of Texas.

History[edit]
TPL was created in February 1888 in the wake of the Texas and Pacific Railway bankruptcy, as a means to dispose of the T&P's vast land holdings. TPL received over 3.5 million acres (14,000 km²), and certain T&P bondholders were allowed to exchange their (now worthless) bonds for trust certificates. The certificates were later divided into "sub-share" certificates (3,000 sub-share certificates is the equivalent of one trust certificate), and the sub-share certificates have been traded on the NYSE since January 1927.
Current operations[edit]
Over 100 years later, even having sold 75 percent of its original landholdings, TPL is still among the largest private landowners in the State of Texas. As of December 31, 2008, TPL owned 963,248.33 acres (3,898.1277 km2) of land in 20 West Texas counties, of which around 70 percent is located in Culberson (315,640.09 acres), Reeves (194,750.28 acres), and Hudspeth (160,467.44 acres) counties. In addition, TPL owns a 1/128 nonparticipating perpetual royalty interest in 85,413.60 acres (over half of which is in Ector and Midland counties, and a 1/16 nonparticipating perpetual royalty interest in 386,987.70 acres (over 60 percent of which is in Culberson and Reeves counties).[1]
Trust income is derived from land sales, oil and gas royalties, grazing and sundry leases, interest on notes receivable, and interest on investments.[2] The trust does not actively seek to sell its landholdings, and on rare occasions actually purchases land. (It last did so in 2008, acquiring 640 acres (2.6 km2) from the State of Texas in a parcel adjacent to existing holdings.)
Sub-share Buy Back Policy[edit]
TPL has a long-standing policy to repurchase sub-shares with excess cash. As noted in the 2015 annual report, "As provided in Article Seventh of the Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, establishing the Trust, it will continue to be the practice of the Trustees to purchase and cancel outstanding certificates and sub-shares. These purchases are generally made in the open market and there is no arrangement, contractual or otherwise, with any person for any such purchase."[3]
In 2015, the Trust purchased and retired 204,335 sub-shares at a cost of $28,771,073, representing an average cost of $140.80 per sub-share. The number of sub-shares purchased and retired in 2015 amounted to 2.5% of the total number of sub-shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014.[4]
The policy of buy backs has reduced the sub-share count by 26% between 2004 and 2015 (from 10,971,375 at the end of 2004[5] to 8,118,064[6] at the end of 2015.)

(It last did so in 2008, acquiring 640 acres (2.6 km2) from the State of Texas in a parcel adjacent to existing holdings.)
Sub-share Buy Back Policy[edit]
TPL has a long-standing policy to repurchase sub-shares with excess cash. As noted in the 2015 annual report, "As provided in Article Seventh of the Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, establishing the Trust, it will continue to be the practice of the Trustees to purchase and cancel outstanding certificates and sub-shares. These purchases are generally made in the open market and there is no arrangement, contractual or otherwise, with any person for any such purchase."[3]
In 2015, the Trust purchased and retired 204,335 sub-shares at a cost of $28,771,073, representing an average cost of $140.80 per sub-share. The number of sub-shares purchased and retired in 2015 amounted to 2.5% of the total number of sub-shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014.[4]
The policy of buy backs has reduced the sub-share count by 26% between 2004 and 2015 (from 10,971,375 at the end of 2004[5] to 8,118,064[6] at the end of 2015.)

Home  TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST  HomeAbout UsSEC FilingsAnnual ReportsCorporate GovernanceContact UsMaps      Photo Courtesy of: Tammy Reyes  Welcome      Texas Pacific Land Trust was created in 1888 as a result of a reorganization of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company following receivership. Holders of Texas and Pacific Railway Company bonds received 3.5 million acres of land in Texas which had been earned by the railroad and pledged as security against bonds. The bondholders created the Trust and converted bonds to shares of proprietary interest in the Trust. The Trust was created to manage and sell the land. Today the Trust is one of the largest landowners in Texas with around 888,333 acres located in eighteen different counties. Texas Pacific Land Trust derives revenue from all avenues of managing the land, i.e. oil and gas royalties, grazing leases, easements, sundry and specialty leases, and land sales. The Trust has a perpetual oil and gas royalty interest in some 459,200 acres.

TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST Company Profile

   Texas Pacific Land Trust was created to sell the Texas & Pacific Railway's land after its 1888 bankruptcy, and yup, they're still workin' on it. The trust began with the railroad's 3.5 million acres; today it is one of the largest private landowners in Texas, with around 960,000 acres in 20 counties. Texas Pacific Land Trust's sales come from oil and gas royalties (70% of sales), grazing leases, easements, and land sales. It has a perpetual oil and gas royalty interest under some 470,000 acres in West Texas. About 8% of the trust's oil and gas royalties are from leases operated by Chevron U.S.A. Texas Pacific Land Trust uses the revenues from sales and royalties to buy and retire its own shares.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Home  TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST  HomeAbout UsSEC FilingsAnnual ReportsCorporate GovernanceContact UsMaps      Photo Courtesy of: Tammy Reyes  Welcome      Texas Pacific Land Trust was created in 1888 as a result of a reorganization of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company following receivership. Holders of Texas and Pacific Railway Company bonds received 3.5 million acres of land in Texas which had been earned by the railroad and pledged as security against bonds. The bondholders created the Trust and converted bonds to shares of proprietary interest in the Trust. The Trust was created to manage and sell the land. Today the Trust is one of the largest landowners in Texas with around 888,333 acres located in eighteen different counties. Texas Pacific Land Trust derives revenue from all avenues of managing the land, i.e. oil and gas royalties, grazing leases, easements, sundry and specialty leases, and land sales. The Trust has a perpetual oil and gas royalty interest in some 459,200 acres.
