      Fitch Ratings has assigned ratings to SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-6 as 
      follows:
    

      --$265,500,000 Floating Rate Class A-1 Notes 'AAAsf'; Rating Watch 
      Negative;
    

      --$192,000,000 Floating Rate Class A-2 Notes 'AAAsf'; Rating Watch 
      Negative;
    

      --$510,700,000 Floating Rate Class A-3 Notes 'AAAsf'; Rating Watch 
      Negative;
    

      --$27,400,000 Floating Rate Class B Notes 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest.
    

      Rating Watch Negative (RWN): All existing and new issuances of 'AAA' 
      rated tranches of FFELP securitizations are on RWN following the 
      revision of the long-term foreign and local currency issuer default 
      ratings (IDRs) of the U.S.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Cash flow scenarios for class A and B 
      notes were satisfactory under Fitch's stresses. At closing, total parity 
      is expected to be 100.79% and senior parity is expected to be 103.64%. 
      Total credit enhancement (CE) is provided by overcollateralization (OC; 
      about $7.86 million at closing), excess spread and, in the case of class 
      A notes, 2.75% subordination provided by the class B notes.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support for SLM 2013-6 notes is 
      provided by a $4.99 million reserve account (0.50% of outstanding 
      notes), funded at closing with note proceeds.
    

      Targeted OC Level: CE must build to the greater of 1.00% of the adjusted 
      pool balance, or $1.25 million before excess cash may be released from 
      the trust.
    

      Satisfactory Servicing Capabilities: Sallie Mae, Inc., as servicer, will 
      be responsible for servicing the 2013-6 portfolio. Fitch believes Sallie 
      Mae is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in 
      FFELP student loan transactions. Additional defaults and basis shock 
      beyond Fitch's published stresses could result in future downgrades. 
      Likewise, a buildup of credit enhancement driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      pre-sale report titled 'SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-6', dated Nov. 4, 
      2013, available on www.fitchratings.com.

EXHIBIT A


 


Consent


 



Each of the undersigned parties
hereby consents, as of April 18, 2016, to the amendment of the
INDENTURE, dated as of November 14, 2013 (the “
Indenture ”), among SLM Student Loan Trust
2013-6, as Issuer (the “ Issuer ”),
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“ DBTCA
”), as eligible lender trustee (the “ Eligible
Lender Trustee ”), and Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company (“ DBNTC ”), as indenture trustee
(the “ Indenture Trustee ”), as amended
from time to time, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Annex A.



The Indenture is being amended to
amend two of the definitions contained therein.



Ratings
Considerations :  Each of the undersigned parties
understands that no assurance can be provided regarding the impact
that the adoption of the amendment will have on the ratings of the
Notes.  As required by the Indenture, the Issuer has provided
prior written notice of the terms of the amendment to each Rating
Agency currently rating the Notes. However, no Rating Agency
confirmation or affirmation of the ratings of the Notes has been
sought or given.  As a result, it is not certain what impact
the adoption of the amendment will have on a Rating Agency’s
decision to add the Notes to or remove the Notes from its negative
watch list for possible downgrade or to downgrade the current
ratings of the Notes.



Further, we have been advised that
it is possible that a Rating Agency may view the adoption of this
amendment as a restructuring of a distressed debt instrument. 
One potential result of this designation would be to cause a
ratings downgrade of the Notes (to reflect the distressed debt
element of their analysis) followed by an upgrade of the rating of
the Notes (to address the restructuring of the Notes).



U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations . 
Each of the undersigned parties understands that the adoption of
the amendment may have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences
to the Noteholders, and the undersigned parties will rely on advice
from their own tax advisors on this matter.  The discussion
below is general in nature and does not address all of the tax
consequences of the adoption of the amendment that may be relevant
to Noteholders.



Although we believe that the
adoption of the amendment will not adversely affect the tax
characterization of the Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, certain adverse tax consequences could apply
to holders if the adoption of the amendment resulted in the Notes
being treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
For a further discussion of  the adverse tax consequences to
Noteholders if the Notes were treated as equity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, see “ U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences—Tax Consequences to Holders of Notes In
General—Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness ” in
the Base Prospectus dated September 9, 2013 (the “ Base
Prospectus ”).



The deferral of the stated maturity
date pursuant to the amendment may be treated as a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
resulting in a deemed exchange.  If the amendment results in a
significant modification and a deemed exchange of “Old
Notes” for “New Notes,” U.S. Noteholders will
recognize gain or loss upon the deemed exchange unless the exchange
qualifies as a tax-free recapitalization.  Although the matter
is not free from doubt, we intend to treat the deemed exchange as
such a recapitalization. If the deemed exchange is a



1







 



tax-free recapitalization, a
Noteholder’s tax basis in the New Notes received pursuant to
a deemed exchange generally will equal the holder’s tax basis
in the Old Notes.



If the amendment results in a
significant modification, the issue price of the New Notes will
depend on whether the New Notes and the Old Notes are properly
characterized as “traded on an established market”
(hereinafter “publicly-traded”) within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. § 1.1273-2(f)(1).  We expect the New
Class A-3 Notes should be characterized as publicly traded and the
New Class B Notes should not be characterized as publicly traded,
and we expect, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that
the stated interest on the New Notes will meet the requirements for
“adequate stated interest” under the Treasury
Regulations.  Consequently, the issue price of the New Class
A-3 Notes should be the fair market value of the New Class A-3
Notes on the date of the deemed exchange ( i.e. , on the
date the amendment becomes effective), and the issue price of the
New Class B Notes should be the “stated principal
amount” of the New Class B Notes.



A New Note received in the deemed
exchange will be treated as having been issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
if the New Note’s “stated principal amount”
exceeds the issue price of the New Notes by more than the
statutorily defined de minimis amount.  In light of the
current trading prices for the Notes, there is a significant
likelihood that the New Class A-3 Notes will be treated as
re-issued with OID.  For a further discussion of the treatment
of OID, see “ U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences—Tax Consequences to Holders of Notes In
General—Original Issue Discount ” in the Base
Prospectus.



If the deemed exchange qualifies as
a recapitalization and a Noteholder’s initial tax basis in
the New Notes exceeds their stated principal amount, the holder
will be considered to have acquired the New Notes with amortizable
bond premium.  In addition, for any Noteholder that acquired
Old Notes with market discount, any gain recognized on the deemed
exchange will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the
market discount accrued during its period of ownership, unless such
holder previously elected to include market discount in income as
it accrued for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Assuming the
deemed exchange qualifies as a recapitalization, in a deemed
exchange of Old Notes with market discount for New Notes, the New
Notes will be treated as acquired with market discount if the issue
price of the New Notes exceeds the holder’s initial tax basis
for such New Notes by more than a de minimis amount, and any
accrued market discount with respect to the Old Notes generally
should carry over to such New Notes.  For a further discussion
of amortizable bond premium and market discount, see “
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to
Holders of Notes In General—Market Discount ” and
“ U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax
Consequences to Holders of Notes In General—Amortizable Bond
Premium ” in the Base Prospectus.



Noteholders are urged to consult
with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the adoption of the amendment.



NOTEHOLDERS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED
THAT EXECUTED AND DELIVERED CONSENTS ARE IRREVOCABLE PRIOR TO THE
EXPIRATION OF THE CONSENT PERIOD (INCLUDING ANY ONE-TIME EXTENSION
THEREOF MADE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE

SLM STUDENT LOAN TRUST
2013-6


AMENDED AND RESTATED

FLOATING RATE CLASS A-3 STUDENT
LOAN-BACKED NOTES


 



SLM Student Loan Trust 2013-6, a
statutory trust organized and existing under the laws of the State
of Delaware (herein referred to as the “Issuer”), for
value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or
registered assigns, the principal sum of [FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND
NO/100 DOLLARS][TEN MILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO/100
DOLLARS] ([$500,000,000][$10,700,000]), payable on each
Distribution Date in an amount equal to the result obtained by
multiplying (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is
$[500,000,000][10,700,000] and the denominator of which is
$510,700,000, by (ii) the aggregate amount, if any, payable to the
Class A-3 Noteholders on such Distribution Date in respect of
principal of the Notes pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Indenture
dated as of November 14, 2013 (the “Indenture”), among
the Issuer, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a New York
banking corporation, as Eligible Lender Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer, and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, a national
banking association, as Indenture Trustee (the “Indenture
Trustee”) (capitalized terms used but not defined herein
being defined in Appendix A to the Indenture, which also contain
rules as to usage that shall be applicable herein); provided
, however , that the entire unpaid principal amount of this
Note shall be due and payable on the June 2055 Distribution Date
(the “Class A-3 Maturity Date”).



The Issuer shall pay interest on
this Note at the rate per annum equal to the Class A-3 Rate (as
defined on the reverse hereof), on each Distribution Date until the
principal of this Note is paid or made available for payment, on
the principal amount of this Note outstanding on the preceding
Distribution Date (after giving effect to all payments of principal
made on the preceding Distribution Date), subject to certain
limitations contained in Section 3.1 of the Indenture. 
Interest on this Note shall accrue from and including the
immediately preceding Distribution Date (or, in the case of the
first Accrual Period, the Closing Date) to but excluding the
following Distribution Date (each an “Accrual
Period”).  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed in each Accrual Period divided by
360.  Such principal of and interest on this Note shall be
paid in the manner specified on the reverse hereof.



The principal of and interest on
this Note are payable in such coin or currency of the United States
of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
public and private debts.  All payments made by the Issuer
with respect to this Note shall be applied first to interest due
and payable on this Note as provided above and then to the unpaid
principal of this Note.



Reference is made to the further
provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which
shall have the same effect as though fully set forth on the face of
this Note.



Unless the certificate of
authentication hereon has been executed by the Indenture Trustee
whose name appears below by manual signature, this Note shall not
be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture referred to on the

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
