BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

1. Avoid involvement, by the business or its principles, in activities that reflect unfavorably on, or otherwise adversely affect the public image of BBB or its accredited businesses.












BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        Tillys Inc has received 1.49 out of 5 stars based on 5 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of D-.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient

Every Foot's Unique, Make Sure You Dress Them with Shoes of Your Choice 

	Shoes are essential. You can’t go a day without putting on a pair of shoes to protect your feet. Well, maybe not if you’re in the house all day, every day. If that’s the case you probably need to put on some shoes and get some sunlight. The type of shoes you wear depends on the person you are. If you are natural born skater, you are going to need some shoes that will help you pull off the perfect kick flip on 6… no 8 stairs. You’re probably the one to go “Off the Wall” in a pair of Vans, or rock a pair of your favorite Stefan Janoski shoes from Nike SB. Don't skate? You can't walk casually in a pair of slip on sneakers. Maybe you are a beach bum, and you can’t allow sand to get into a pair of sneakers. An awesome pair of flip flops from O’Neill, Rainbow, or Volcom would probably do the trick. You may also be the fashionista, looking for the best trends in footwear. You enjoy going through your closet to find the perfect pair of booties to match your outfit. A girl like you would love a new pair of boots from UGG, SODA, and Steve Madden. It doesn’t matter what your style is. Tillys has all the shoes, sandals, slippers, and boots to fit your personality.

Tilly's shares rally more than 14% on narrower-than-expected quarterly loss
Shares of Tilly's Inc.  rose more than 14% late Tuesday after the retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss and sales were above expectations. Tilly's said it lost $161,000, or 1 cent a share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Total net sales reached $120.9 million, up 0.6% from $120.2 million a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a loss of 10 cents a share on sales of $114.4 million. Comparable-store sales rose 0.6%. The company said it expects comparable-store sales to range between flat to up in the low single digits and an income per diluted share between 3 cents to 7 cents. Tilly's shares ended the regular trading day down 1.4%.

Tilly's shares rally more than 14% on narrower-than-expected quarterly loss
Shares of Tilly's Inc.  rose more than 14% late Tuesday after the retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss and sales were above expectations. Tilly's said it lost $161,000, or 1 cent a share, in the quarter, compared with a net loss of $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Total net sales reached $120.9 million, up 0.6% from $120.2 million a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected a loss of 10 cents a share on sales of $114.4 million. Comparable-store sales rose 0.6%. The company said it expects comparable-store sales to range between flat to up in the low single digits and an income per diluted share between 3 cents to 7 cents. Tilly's shares ended the regular trading day down 1.4%.

Announces Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Introduces Fiscal 2017 First Quarter OutlookBusiness WireMarch 13, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareIRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tilly’s, Inc. (TLYS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter (thirteen weeks) and full year (52 weeks) of fiscal 2016 ended January 28, 2017.“We finished fiscal 2016 with three consecutive quarters of year over year operating income growth and our first annual improvement in operating income of the last five years," stated Ed Thomas, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong balance sheet enabled us to reward shareholders with a $20 million special dividend in February. While we are encouraged by these results, we will continue to seek ways to improve profitability and continue our progress during fiscal 2017."Fourth Quarter Results OverviewThe following comparisons refer to operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 ended January 30, 2016: Total net sales were $160.2 million, an increase of 0.7% from $159.1 million last year.  Comparable store sales, which include e-commerce sales, increased 0.1%. Comparable store sales increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter last year.  Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 30.6% from 31.4% last year. The 80 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a 60 basis point decline in product margins from increased markdowns and a 20 basis point increase in buying, distribution and occupancy costs.  Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $38.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from $40.5 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A improved 130 basis points to 24.1% from 25.4% last year. This improvement was primarily driven by the combination of more efficient marketing spend, lower non-cash store impairment charges, and corporate payroll savings.  Operating income was $10.4 million, or 6.5% of net sales, compared to $9.5 million, or 6.0% of net sales, last year. The 50 basis point increase in our operating margin was primarily attributable to the reductions in SG&A noted above.  Our effective tax rate was 40.2% compared to 69.6% last year. Last year's tax rate was higher primarily due to increased discrete items related to stock option expirations.  Net income was $6.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, last year. Fiscal 2016 Full Year Results OverviewThe following comparisons refer to operating results for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015 ended January 30, 2016: Total net sales were $569 million, an increase of 3.3% from $551 million last year.  Comparable store sales, which include e-commerce sales, increased 0.5%. Comparable store sales increased 1.2% in fiscal 2015.  Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 29.6% compared to 30.4% last year. This 80 basis point decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in product margins as a result of increased markdowns.  SG&A was $149.1 million, a slight decrease from $149.2 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A improved 90 basis points to 26.2% from 27.1% last year. This improvement was primarily driven by the combination of more efficient marketing spend, lower stock-based compensation, and corporate payroll savings.  Operating income was $19.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $18.1 million last year. Operating margin improved 10 basis points to 3.4% of net sales compared 3.3% last year.  Income tax expense was $8.3 million, or 42.2% of pre-tax income, compared to $10.6 million, or 58.4% of pre-tax income, last year. Last year's tax rate was higher primarily due to increased discrete items related to stock option expirations.  Net income was $11.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $7.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, last year. Balance Sheet and LiquidityAs of January 28, 2017, the Company had $134 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility. This compares to $101 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt outstanding as of January 30, 2016. As previously announced, the Company paid a special cash dividend of approximately $20 million to shareholders on February 24, 2017.Fiscal 2017 First Quarter OutlookThe Company's quarter-to-date comparable store sales, including e-commerce, have decreased by a high single-digit percentage due to a later Easter versus the comparable prior year period and significant weather issues in its heritage markets of California, Arizona and Nevada during February. As a result, the Company expects its first quarter comparable store sales to decrease by a low to mid single-digit percentage, operating loss to be in the range of $(3) million to $(7) million, and loss per share to be in the range of $(0.07) to $(0.15). This compares to a loss of $(0.10) for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This assumes an anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 40% and weighted average shares of approximately 29 million.Conference Call InformationA conference call to discuss the financial results is scheduled for today, March 13, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).
