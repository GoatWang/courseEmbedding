Life[edit]
Tranter was born in Cooma, New South Wales and attended country schools, then took his BA in 1970 after attending university sporadically. He has worked mainly in publishing, teaching and radio production, and has travelled widely, making more than twenty reading tours to venues in the U.S., Britain and Europe since the mid-1980s. He has lived in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in Australia, and overseas in London, Cambridge, Singapore, Florida, and San Francisco. He now lives in Sydney, where he is a company director (with his wife Lyn) of Australian Literary Management, a leading literary agency. He is married to Lyn, with adult children Kirsten and Leon, and in 2009 completed a Doctorate of Creative Arts University of Wollongong (conferred, highly commended).

Literary career[edit]
In 1975 John Tranter co-designed the first Books & Writing radio program for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a program format which was still going strong thirty years later. During 1987 and 1988 John Tranter was in charge of the ABC Radio National weekly two-hour arts program Radio Helicon, and from 1990 to 1993 he was the poetry editor of the Sydney-based business/ arts weekly The Bulletin.
He has received many fellowships and other grants, and has been a visiting scholar at various institutions, from Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Arts at the Australian National University to writer-in-residence at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida and at Cambridge University in England. He has published over twenty volumes of poetry, including Urban Myths: 210 Poems: New and Selected (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 2006) and Starlight: 150 Poems (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 2010).
His Starlight: 150 Poems, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Queensland State Literary Award for poetry and the Age Book of the Year award for poetry in 2011, and Urban Myths: 210 Poems: New and Selected, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Victorian Premier's Prize for poetry in 2006, the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Kenneth Slessor Prize in 2007, the South Australian Premier's Awards John Bray prize for poetry in 2008 and the South Australian Premier's Awards Premier's Prize for the best book overall (2006 and 2007) in 2008. His Under Berlin, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry (the New South Wales State Literary Award for Poetry) in 1989, and At The Florida won the Melbourne Age 'Book of the Year' award for poetry in 1993. Other recent books are The Floor of Heaven (Harper Collins, 1992), a book-length sequence of four verse narratives, the poetry collections Late Night Radio (Polygon, Edinburgh, UK, 1998), Heart Print (Salt, Cambridge, UK, 2001), Different Hands (Folio/ Fremantle Arts Centre Press, Cambridge and Western Australia, 1998), a collection of seven experimental computer-assisted prose pieces, Borrowed Voices (Shoestring Press, Nottingham, 2002), a dozen reinterpretations of poems by other poets, Studio Moon and Trio (both Salt Publications, UK, 2003).
He compiled and edited The Penguin Book of Modern Australian Poetry with Philip Mead in 1991. Earlier anthologies include the controversial The New Australian Poetry (Makar, Brisbane, 1979), and a selection of ninety-four poems from the Australian bicentennial poetry competition in 1988, published by ABC Books as The Tin Wash Dish.
In 2004 he built a free prototype internet site that presented biographical and bibliographical information about over seventy Australian poets as well as poems, book reviews and interviews. In 2005 he handed the project over to a consortium consisting of the University of Sydney English Department, the University of Sydney Library and the Copyright Agency Limited. In 2006 the consortium was granted half a million dollars by the Australian Research Council to further extend the work as a research project as the Australian Poetry Library with an internet site hosted by the University of Sydney Library, at http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/. The project was launched at State Government House, Sydney, on 25 May 2011, by which time it featured over 42,000 poems by Australian poets from 1800 to the present.
In 2012 he began a regular Internet journal at http://johntranter.net/ In 2013 he posted to the Commentaries section of «Jacket2» magazine a list of links to some fifty pieces he authored or edited or photographed in «Jacket» magazine over thirteen years, at http://jacket2.org/commentary/tranter-jacket
In 2014 John Tranter founded the Journal of Poetics Research at http://poeticsresearch.com, together with three other Managing Editors: Dr Kate Lilley, University of Sydney; Dr Ann Vickery, Deakin University; and Professor Philip Mead, University of Western Australia; and some thirty other (mostly international) editors.

MaintenanceO＆M ProceduresBack


Left Column Content​Instrumentation around critical process exchangers is invaluable in analyzing and troubleshooting performance issues and in planning maintenance.
 
Often, significant fouling like this can be prevented by increasing flow rate at regular intervals, employing increased fluid turbulence to wash off. 
 
 

All brands of plate heat exchangers can be included in a Tranter PM Service Contract.
 




BodyHeat Exchanger Operation & Maintenance Procedures
 
Analyzing And Troubleshooting Heat Exchanger Performance
Heat exchanger problems are not always accompanied by obvious symptoms such as leaks or channel intermixing. Some problems are minor but progressive, causing higher energy consumption and performance variability. Dirt, deposits, scale and other fouling rob your plate-type heat exchangers of their design efficiency, risking damage to expensive equipment and unscheduled downtime for repairs.
 
Process data around the heat exchanger is invaluable in analyzing and troubleshooting performance. Pressure, flow rate and temperature data from channel inlets and outlets can indicate problems with either stream. Instrumentation is well worth the cost of installation, especially for process-critical exchangers, serving to signal operators when the process is about to become uncontrollable.
 
If measurements and inspections indicate that cleaning and regasketing is warranted, doing the job properly can prevent damage to costly plates. Plate damage leads to leaks, faulty operation and reduced equipment life.
 
Standard Heat Exchanger Operating Procedures
Standard operating principles are critical for preventing damage to the unit:
1. In steam applications, never leave the steam on with the liquid side turned off. Turn the steam off first and on last.
2. Water hammer, if suspected, must be diagnosed and eliminated, or damage may result.
3. Pumps should always be started against closed valves.
4. Valves must be set to open and close gradually. Sudden opening and closing of the valves will subject the exchanger to mechanical and thermal shock and may cause material fatigue.
Starting up and shutting down should be managed to minimize differential expansion. Follow the stated start-up and shut-down steps in order.
 
Minimizing Fouling
The rate of heat transfer surface fouling is affected by fluid velocity. Tranter recommends that the flow rate be increased if possible at regular intervals. The increased turbulence within the channel retards the rate of fouling. The frequency and duration of this preventive cleaning practice will vary depending on operating fluid velocities and fouling tendencies of the medium.
 
Maintaining Plate Heat Exchangers
Heat exchanger maintenance is critical for controllability and energy efficiency. Operations managers will be quick to detect a problem and contact you about it. Typical problems include interior comfort complaints, off-grade product, escalating utility bills and related troubles. Methodical diagnostics will save time and prevent wasted effort. These should be outlined in your heat exchanger operations and maintenance manuals. 
 
 

 
Tranter Service Center Crews are ready to restore leaking, inefficient, fuel-wasting heat exchangers to nameplate performance (right) at any time.

Life[edit]
Tranter was born in Cooma, New South Wales and attended country schools, then took his BA in 1970 after attending university sporadically. He has worked mainly in publishing, teaching and radio production, and has travelled widely, making more than twenty reading tours to venues in the U.S., Britain and Europe since the mid-1980s. He has lived in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in Australia, and overseas in London, Cambridge, Singapore, Florida, and San Francisco. He now lives in Sydney, where he is a company director (with his wife Lyn) of Australian Literary Management, a leading literary agency. He is married to Lyn, with adult children Kirsten and Leon, and in 2009 completed a Doctorate of Creative Arts University of Wollongong (conferred, highly commended).

Literary career[edit]
In 1975 John Tranter co-designed the first Books & Writing radio program for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a program format which was still going strong thirty years later. During 1987 and 1988 John Tranter was in charge of the ABC Radio National weekly two-hour arts program Radio Helicon, and from 1990 to 1993 he was the poetry editor of the Sydney-based business/ arts weekly The Bulletin.
He has received many fellowships and other grants, and has been a visiting scholar at various institutions, from Visiting Fellow in the Faculty of Arts at the Australian National University to writer-in-residence at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida and at Cambridge University in England. He has published over twenty volumes of poetry, including Urban Myths: 210 Poems: New and Selected (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 2006) and Starlight: 150 Poems (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 2010).
His Starlight: 150 Poems, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Queensland State Literary Award for poetry and the Age Book of the Year award for poetry in 2011, and Urban Myths: 210 Poems: New and Selected, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Victorian Premier's Prize for poetry in 2006, the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Kenneth Slessor Prize in 2007, the South Australian Premier's Awards John Bray prize for poetry in 2008 and the South Australian Premier's Awards Premier's Prize for the best book overall (2006 and 2007) in 2008. His Under Berlin, published by the University of Queensland Press, won the Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry (the New South Wales State Literary Award for Poetry) in 1989, and At The Florida won the Melbourne Age 'Book of the Year' award for poetry in 1993. Other recent books are The Floor of Heaven (Harper Collins, 1992), a book-length sequence of four verse narratives, the poetry collections Late Night Radio (Polygon, Edinburgh, UK, 1998), Heart Print (Salt, Cambridge, UK, 2001), Different Hands (Folio/ Fremantle Arts Centre Press, Cambridge and Western Australia, 1998), a collection of seven experimental computer-assisted prose pieces, Borrowed Voices (Shoestring Press, Nottingham, 2002), a dozen reinterpretations of poems by other poets, Studio Moon and Trio (both Salt Publications, UK, 2003).
He compiled and edited The Penguin Book of Modern Australian Poetry with Philip Mead in 1991. Earlier anthologies include the controversial The New Australian Poetry (Makar, Brisbane, 1979), and a selection of ninety-four poems from the Australian bicentennial poetry competition in 1988, published by ABC Books as The Tin Wash Dish.
In 2004 he built a free prototype internet site that presented biographical and bibliographical information about over seventy Australian poets as well as poems, book reviews and interviews. In 2005 he handed the project over to a consortium consisting of the University of Sydney English Department, the University of Sydney Library and the Copyright Agency Limited. In 2006 the consortium was granted half a million dollars by the Australian Research Council to further extend the work as a research project as the Australian Poetry Library with an internet site hosted by the University of Sydney Library, at http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/. The project was launched at State Government House, Sydney, on 25 May 2011, by which time it featured over 42,000 poems by Australian poets from 1800 to the present.
In 2012 he began a regular Internet journal at http://johntranter.net/ In 2013 he posted to the Commentaries section of «Jacket2» magazine a list of links to some fifty pieces he authored or edited or photographed in «Jacket» magazine over thirteen years, at http://jacket2.org/commentary/tranter-jacket
In 2014 John Tranter founded the Journal of Poetics Research at http://poeticsresearch.com, together with three other Managing Editors: Dr Kate Lilley, University of Sydney; Dr Ann Vickery, Deakin University; and Professor Philip Mead, University of Western Australia; and some thirty other (mostly international) editors. The first (free) issue was published at the end of September 2014, and two issue per year, in March and September, were planned at that time.

Service Center crews are ready to restore plate heat exchanger uptime on a 24-hr basis.
 
No field repair is certified ready for reinstallation without passing a hydrotest.
 
 
In field service, pressure washing of fouled plates (left) and regasketing are all that is necessary to restore a plate heat exchanger to design performance. 
 




BodyReconditioning and Field Service for Heat Exchangers 
 
Field Service
Tranter Service Center field service crews are available at any time to restore your plate heat exchangers to nameplate condition. Whether serviced during a planned shutdown or on an emergency basis, your exchangers will benefit from OEM parts and service. Service Centers are backed by Tranter worldwide engineering resources, including design, applications and materials engineering. All our on-site work carries one year warranty protection on new parts with workmanship and labor also guaranteed.
 
On-site services include:
•Plate pack refurbishment (opening and closing of exchanger, pressure washing plates, visual plate inspection, checking and replacing gaskets as needed)
•Plate pack exchange
•Hydro/line testing of exchangers
•Troubleshooting
•Delivery and pick-up (for work in our shop)
 
Our crews also provide cleaning services on Tranter and most brands of welded plate heat exchangers. If a channel can be reached, we can usually pressure wash out most contamination. 
 
Tranter service technicians carry applicable national service certifications:
•USA: OSHA 10-hour general industry training standards
•Canada: First aid, WHIMS, H2S Alive®, rigging and OH&S Standards
 
 
Tranter field service crews remove efficiency-robbing scale or fouling from plates under scheduled or emergency maintenance schemes.

                           Winner 2006 CJ Dennis Prize for Poetry (Victorian Premier's Literary Awards) Urban Myths: 210 Poems brings the best work to
                              date from a poet considered one of the most original of his generation in Australia, together with a generous selection of
                              new work. Smart, wry and very stylish, John Tranter's poems investigate the vagaries of perception and the ability of language
                              to converge life, imagination and art so that we arrive, unexpectedly, at the deepest human mysteries. JUDGES REPORT - Victorian
                              Premier's Literary Awards The new and uncollected poems in John Tranter's Urban Myths make a significant addition to his oeuvre.
                              Control and ease are evident in the writing, which displays personages, occasions and moods of the metropolitan modern world.
                              Tranter's latest poems refresh through the exercise of urbane skills: this is a poet suave and playful, but never aloof; linguistically
                              various, assured in style, and never less than fully attentive

                              The poems in Studio Moon were written over the last fifteen years, and cover a wide range of styles and approaches: poems
                                 that are answers to other poets' work, sometimes wrenched out of context, borrowings from Matthew Arnold and Barbara Guest,
                                 and dozens of others all imbued with Tranter's trademark blend of wit, style and feeling

                              Heart Print is the work of an important writer in mid career. These fluent, energetic and readable poems range from the sonnet
                                 through to discursive prose. They focus sharply on the contemporary world, from the political to the religious, from the public
                                 arena to the deeply personal
