Sound Quality
I play rock, blues, Soul, R&B, and attempt to play some Country and Jazz stuff. 

I play through 2 amps : a Fargen Blackbird and a Suhr Badger with a Reinhardt 1x12 cab.

This guitar sounds terrific, it is based a strat sound but it has subtleties in that type of sound that are unique to Tyler and make this guitar much more interesting than most other super strat types. The Wilkinson Bridge makes the guitar a little darker then it would be with a Vintage type bridge but the choice of pups on the guitar plays off of this to make the Landau warm. The Humbucker is superb it really nails those classic rock type sounds at low to mid gain and 80's rock and hard rock when set at high gain. If you turn the volume down at mid gain you can also get some close to a Tele Crunch sound that is just great (this sound is so good it makes me wonder why I should keep my tele around). The single coils are great and do a great job at recreating a sixties strat vibe (but with their own subtelty). Sounds great for Hendrix, Pink Floyd, SRV, Blues, Funk, Soul and a whole bunch of other stuff. Lastly the second position on the pup switch gives you a sound that is real close to the second position on a strat, I wasn't expecting this from a super strat it is just brilliant.

I also had the opportunity to compare this Landau with a friends Landau Classic that had Suhr 60 lps and a Trembucker. The Suhr 60's are more Hifi and broghter than the Dimarzio but I still prefer the Dimarzio as they sound more vintage. the JB Trembucker is more middy than the Landau Bucker but again I prefer the Landau Bucker as it sounds closer to a PAF and has less output than the JB. 
Reliability/Durability
Build quality is fantastic so I don't expect any issues from this guitar. Every component used on it is top quality. It should last a life time if properly taken care of.
Price/Value

General Comments
I've been playing close on 10 years. Aside from the Tyler, I own a Gibson 59 reissue Les Paul, a Fender 56 Relic, a Hot rodded Mexican Tele (Lollar pups and Glendale Bridge) and a Collings D2H acoustic. If I were to rank my instruments for quality this one would come joint first with the Collings followed by the Fender's.

If it was stolen I would try and get one again.

I am giving it a 10 but in reality it is about a 9.7/ or 9.8 because of the no tone control on the bridge pup, which just seems illogical to me. It would be unfair to give it a 9 because of this issue because the guitar is closer to a 10.
