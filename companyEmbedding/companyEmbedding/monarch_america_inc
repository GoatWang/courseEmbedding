WESTMINSTER, Colo., Dec. 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Monarch America Inc. (OTCQB: CANK) ("Monarch America" or the "Company") (f/k/a Cannabis Kinetics Corp.) is pleased to provide this review of the Company's recent achievements and strategic outline for continued growth in 2015.
"Over this past year, we achieved many of our early stage corporate goals and I am extremely proud to say that Monarch America is in a stronger and more diversified position today than it has ever been," stated Eric Hagen, CEO of Monarch America Inc.  "During the year, in addition to witnessing the incredible growth of the state legal cannabis sector across the United States, we successfully became a publicly traded company, launched the Monarch America national brand of products, established an import and distribution business for high demand coco coir growing medium in Colorado, and changed our name to better reflect our brand and expanded business model."  
Hagen continued, "But the most significant milestones during the past year have been our agreement to acquire the multi-million dollar The Big Tomato hydroponics and indoor garden supply business, and our ability to attract over $1.9 million in new capital commitments.  Both of these achievements have positioned Monarch America for continued growth and expansion potential beyond our original cannabis focused business model.
"Our strategy for 2015 is designed to take Monarch America, the company and the brand, to the next level.  This includes establishing new The Big Tomato locations in select markets across the country, building scale to our coco coir operation, launching new products under the Monarch America brand, and leveraging our extensive industry knowledge and expertise through consulting with other businesses.  We anticipate making significant progress on all these fronts in the near future."
Hagen concluded, "I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank the entire Monarch America team, our partners, our customers, and our incredible investors and shareholders for making 2014 so successful.  Without their continued support this would not have been possible.  I look forward to even more success in 2015 and beyond."  
Monarch America Inc. (f/k/a Cannabis Kinetics Corp.) files reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission on EDGAR and anticipates continuing to file such reports.  The Company's filings can be viewed at www.sec.gov.
Additional information regarding the Company can also be found on its website at www.MonarchAmerica.com.

(  OTCQB :  BTFL ) ("Monarch America" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that the Company has entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Colorado Business Associates LLC, the exclusive owner of a group of proprietary products known as MiraClays.The Exclusive Distribution Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, appoints Monarch America as the exclusive distributor of MiraClays products for the agricultural industry in the United States and Canada.MiraClays is microscopic crystalline calcium clay, rich in over 70 other minerals and trace elements. When utilized in the agricultural industry, 100% natural MiraClays can be applied directly onto the growing medium or mix in water. The results are larger and greener plants. Laboratory testing and extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that MiraClays utilized in cannabis growing operations provides increased THC/CBD yield per plant, accelerated growth rates, enhanced potency and flavor, and healthier plants with sturdier stocks and more extensive root systems."We are very pleased to have added another exclusive high-demand soil amendment product to be sold under the Monarch America brand at our The Big Tomato brick-and-mortar store in Colorado and potentially through other leading distributors across the country and in Canada," stated Eric Hagen, CEO of Monarch America Inc. "Laboratory tests have shown that MiraClays can boost THC and CBD production, so this represents a potentially huge advantage to a commercial operator in the increasingly competitive cannabis growing sector."Hagen concluded, "We look forward to building awareness and acceptance of the benefits of MiraClays and other Monarch America branded products within the cannabis sector and also in other high-value agricultural applications."Monarch America Inc. files reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission on EDGAR and anticipates continuing to file such reports.

(  OTCQB :  BTFL ) ("Monarch America" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Robert Shepherd to the newly created position of Native American Tribal Relations Officer."We are extremely honored to have Mr. Shepherd join the Monarch America team as our Tribal Relations Officer. His extensive experience, contacts, and recognized standing within the Native American community makes him ideally suited to help us build new mutually beneficial partnerships with federally recognized Indian tribes entering the marijuana business on sovereign tribal lands across the country," stated Eric Hagen, CEO of Monarch America Inc. "I look forward to working closely with Robert and his numerous contacts within the Native American community to establish Monarch America as one of the first design and management consulting groups in this new marketplace and to help provide further economic and social empowerment to Native American tribes across the country."Robert Shepherd is the former Chairman of the Great Sioux Nation of South Dakota (Feb. 2012 - Jan. 2015), the former Secretary of the National Congress of American Indians (Oct. 2013 - Jan. 2015), the former Chairman of and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate (Jan. 2011 - Jan. 2015), and former Co-Chairman of the Tribal Interior Budget Council (Mar. 2013 - Nov. 2014). Mr. Shepherd served our country in the U.S. Navy (Nov. 1996 - Feb. 2004) reaching the rank of Petty Officer 2nd Class and he is presently a Board Member of the South Dakota Board of Military Affairs. Mr. Shepherd earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of North Dakota in 2008 and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the University of Mary in 2010. He currently provides consulting and government relations services to select public and private sector clients.Robert Shepherd commented, "I'm very excited for this opportunity to work with Eric Hagen and Monarch America to develop new marijuana focused business opportunities on Native American lands. I have known and worked closely with Eric for many years on various tribal economic development projects and his family has deep roots within the tribal community, in fact, his grandparents are from my home town of Sisseton. His grandfather worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for 20 years and his grandmother was the Academic Dean for our tribal college here at the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribe. She was also the director for an early childhood program on our reservation for 10 years. I have no doubt that this shared understanding of the importance of family and community will contribute significantly to the success of our future projects and help to create further new jobs and economic prosperity for all our partners."The potential for Native American groups to begin regulated production and sale of cannabis on tribal lands is an entirely new growth opportunity for Monarch America. This has only recently started to gain momentum after the U.S. Department of Justice publicly released an official memo in December 2014 informing all United States Attorneys that their marijuana enforcement efforts on Native American tribal lands should be guided by a 2013 U.S. Department of Justice memo previously urging prosecutors not to interfere with state-sanctioned cannabis regulations as long as certain conditions were met.According to recently published statistics, there are 326 federally recognized Native American reservations and 566 federally recognized Indian tribes in the United States.Monarch America Inc. files reports with the Securities & Exchange Commission on EDGAR and anticipates continuing to file such reports. The Company's filings can be viewed at www.sec.gov.Additional information regarding Monarch America, Inc.

Colorado pot firm’s uncertain future doesn’t deter South Dakota tribe

Published: Jul 15, 2015, 5:43 pm • Updated: May 24, 2017, 9:19 am  By Regina Garcia Cano,  Associated Press FLANDREAU, S.D. — When the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe announced an agreement with an outside business for advice on how to grow and sell marijuana on its land, it touted the consultant’s experience advising other groups on the topic and that it’s a publicly traded company.
But documents filed by Colorado-based Monarch America Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission show its auditor has raised “substantial doubt” over its ability to continue as a going concern, with management estimating it needs more than $2.5 million in revenue by the end of March to stay afloat.
Flandreau Santee Sioux President Anthony Reider told The Associated Press that tribal officials knew of Monarch’s financial challenges but chose it because the company was willing to sign a short-term deal and sought a smaller share of profits than other consulting firms.
“Obviously, it raised a red flag,” Reider said of the SEC filings. “But … there are so many people in the industry that would be able to step in and help in the event that they were to close.”
Monarch CEO Eric Hagen said in an interview that efforts to raise the revenue are going “very well,” but wouldn’t elaborate. He downplayed Monarch’s financial challenges, saying the company is “in a good position currently.”
The tribe already operates a casino and other businesses on its land and sees marijuana as a way to bring in more money to develop housing and other projects. It’s estimating a monthly profit of up to $2 million from a 15,000-square-foot recreational area that would include bowling, arcade games, gambling machines, bar and food service and an outdoor music venue.

The legalization vote in June came six months after the Justice Department outlined a new policy allowing Indian tribes, which are considered sovereign nations, to grow and sell marijuana on tribal lands under the same conditions laid out for states that have legalized the drug.
Federal officials aren’t tracking tribes that will be selling pot, but groups monitoring nationwide developments believe the Flandreau tribe is the first to take advantage of the new policy in a state that has not decriminalized the use of marijuana.
Monarch is advising the tribe on the facility’s engineering as well as the best practices for growing marijuana. It isn’t managing either the indoor growing site or the recreational lounge where people may use the drug.
The company was founded in Nevada in 2010 as Lingas Ventures Inc., a mineral exploration company. Current management took over in 2014, acquired a hydroponic light and indoor gardening supplies company called The Big Tomato and renamed the company Cannabis Kinetics Corp. It became Monarch America in December.
Monarch touts services that can “elevate the business of cultivation from the erratically stocked, sparsely staffed and managed, independent-store model to that of an efficient and consistently managed organization,” according to an SEC filing.
Hagen said Monarch manages growing sites in Washington state and Colorado, one of which tribal officials visited before signing the agreement in June. The company expects to begin receiving monthly payments of $50,000 starting in August under a management services agreement with Green Sky Inc., an indoor growing site in Denver.
But in a recent quarterly filing, the company said it doesn’t have enough cash to cover expenses over the next 12 months. It warned that failure to raise enough capital “will have a severe negative impact on its ability to remain a viable company.”

A going concern doubt, meaning auditors believe a firm doesn’t have the resources to stay in business, complicates a company’s chances of finding investors, said Ashwinpaul Sondhi, president of the A.C. Sondhi & Associates investment and consulting firm in Florida.
“The basic question for any new investor would be ‘How are they going to get their money out?’ There are so many other investments that are available,” Sondhi said. “So in order to invest in something that is so risky that it has a going concern problem, you need to not only make sure that you get your money back, but of course the normal problem of how are you going to get a return on your investment.”
Monarch needs $1 million by March 30 to pay the former owners of The Big Tomato and faces a Jan. 30 deadline to repay more than $1.15 million to a creditor. As of March, the company had $226,060 in cash and liabilities of more than $3.6 million. Its stock was trading Wednesday at 7 cents per share.
Its five-year agreement with the Flandreau Santee Sioux calls for Monarch to get a fixed percentage of net revenues for its consulting services. The agreement has two five-year renewal options. Neither Monarch nor Reider would give financial details.
Construction began this week and marijuana cultivation is expected to start in October, with the tribe hoping to have product ready for sale in December.

What Clients Say 




 

Nick Ciardiello owns and operates 22 routes, maintains a fleet of 40 vehicles and employs 46 people. In his 40 vehicle fleet, 34 of those are Hino trucks...




 



Nick Ciardiello
FedEx Ground (United States) 



 

 

I have had no problems with my Hino truck: it is reliable and is a true trouble free truck. I could not be more satisfied. Monarch Truck Center is a great company and is the only place I will ever buy a truck...




 



Howard Chan
Owner - Dupont Market (Oakland, CA) 



 

 

Monarch came to us a year ago to see if we were interested in trying the HINO brand. When we did our homework about HINO we noticed that their trucks have been test proven around the world...




 



Vincent Haavisto
Owner, All Ways Towing and Transport (Northern California) 



 

 

Now that Monarch has taken over the maintenance and replaced my problem trucks with Hinos my operating costs have been reduced significantly...




 



Dave Johnson
Fleet Manager - Golden State Overnight (CA, AZ, NV)
