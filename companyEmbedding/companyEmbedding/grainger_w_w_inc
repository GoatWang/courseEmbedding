(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger is a broad line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger's operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with a presence also in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a combination of multichannel and single channel online business models to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products, utilizing sales representatives, catalogs, direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves approximately 3 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers and websites. Grainger's two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger's U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands - Grainger, Grainger's Canadian operating segment. Other businesses, which include Zoro and operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are not material individually. Business Environment. Given Grainger's large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves, several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger's business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger's growth. Grainger's sales in the United States and Canada tend to positively correlate with Business Investment, Exports, Industrial Production and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the United States, sales also tend to positively correlate with Business Inventory. In Canada, sales also tend to positively correlate with oil prices. The table below provides these estimated indicators for 2015 and 2016: United States Canada Estimated 2015 Forecasted 2016 Estimated 2015 Forecasted 2016 Business Investment 3.1 % 4.4 % (2.8)% (1.9)% Business Inventory 4.4 % 1.5 % - - Exports 1.1 % 1.9 % 2.9 % 1.7 % Industrial Production 1.3 % (0.4)% (2.1)% (1.4)% GDP 2.4 % 2.4 % 1.2 % 1.3 % Oil Prices $49/barrel $39/barrel $49/barrel $39/barrel Source: Global Insight (February 2016)  In the United States, business investment and exports are two major indicators of MRO spend. Equipment spending slowed in 2015. While many companies invested steadily, firms directly and indirectly exposed to the oil and gas sector significantly reduced capital spending. The nearly 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar during 2015, as measured by the Federal Reserve on a trade weighted basis, contributed to U.S. exports of industrial supplies and materials in November reaching their lowest levels in 5 years. In the forecast, equipment spending growth accelerates from 3.1% in 2015 to approximately 4.4% in 2016, as the drag from the stronger U.S. dollar and low energy prices dissipates and companies invest at rates consistent with an economy growing at a 2.5-3.0% rate. Global Insight expects the U.S. dollar to continue to strengthen during 2016 but at a decelerating pace over the first half of the year, mainly due to tightening monetary policy and accelerating U.S. economic growth. Exports and imports are forecast to continue to be impacted by the stronger dollar in 2016, preventing overall growth from accelerating in 2016.  result, an oil-price recovery will be delayed. Instead, a more gradual climb in oil prices will keep real GDP growth at 2.0% or less through 2017.  The start of 2016 shows more evidence of weakness in the Canadian economy. The further drop in energy prices is taking a toll on Canada with manufacturing output declining in the latest GDP report. As such, real GDP growth prospects have been lowered for 2016 to only 1.3%. The low Canadian dollar continues to put upward pressure on inflation, and with a few exceptions the domestic economy faces many challenges. The rapid deterioration of oil prices to levels not seen in over a decade continue to impact the performance of the Canadian business, which is heavily dependent on the natural resources sector. Most analysts are forecasting little to no improvement in oil prices through at least the first half of 2016.  Outlook. Grainger plans to continue to execute changes in the U.S. and Canada in 2016 while continuing to make investments in its supply chain, eCommerce capabilities, information systems, sales force productivity tools and inventory management services. These investments will support the Company's revenue growth objectives of (i) continuing to grow its share of business with large, complex customers; (ii) creating a unique value proposition to further penetrate the medium customer segment and (iii) further leveraging its eCommerce capabilities to serve smaller customers. Through the execution of the restructuring initiatives in both the U.S. and Canada, the Company will reduce its cost base, while ensuring that it continues to deliver an effortless customer experience. On January 26, 2016, Grainger reiterated its 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.80 to $13.00 and its 2016 sales guidance of -1 to 7 percent.  Matters Affecting Comparability. Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2015, 2014 and 2013, all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Grainger's operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates.  Results of Operations   For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0.1 % 5.6 % Cost of merchandise sold 57.6 56.7 56.2 1.6 6.6 Gross profit 42.4 43.3 43.8 (1.9 ) 4.3 Operating expenses 29.4 29.8 30.1 (1.2 ) 4.5 Operating earnings 13.0 13.5 13.7 (3.5 ) 3.9 Other income (expense) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) 289.7 37.6 Income taxes 4.7 5.2 5.1 (10.8 ) 8.8 Noncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 0.1 53.1 (1.4 ) Net earnings attributable to W.W. Grainger, Inc. 7.7 % 8.1 % 8.4 % (4.1 )% 0.6 %  2015 Compared to 2014 Grainger's net sales of $9,973 million for 2015 were flat when compared with net sales of $9,965 million for 2014. Contributors to the sales performance for 2015 were as follows: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 2 Business acquisition 2 Price (1) Foreign exchange (3) Total -%  Sales growth to light manufacturing and government customers were offset by a decline in sales to natural resource customers, contractors, resellers and heavy manufacturing customers. In 2015, eCommerce sales for Grainger were $4,133 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year and represented 41% of total sales. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales via EDI and electronic purchasing platforms in the United States. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details.  Gross profit of $4,231 million for 2015 decreased 2%. The gross profit margin for 2015 was 42.4%, down 0.9 percentage point versus 2014, primarily driven by higher sales to lower margin customers and price deflation exceeding cost deflation.  Operating expenses of $2,931 million for 2015 decreased 1% from $2,967 million for 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower employee benefits, partially offset by higher severance and contract services costs. Operating expenses included an incremental $132 million in growth-related spending on eCommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain and inventory management solutions, as well as $42 million of charges primarily related to reorganizing the businesses in the United States and Canada. In 2014, operating expenses included $51 million related to the closing of the business in Brazil, restructuring costs and the transition of the retirement plan in Europe and an impairment charge for the business in Colombia. Excluding the reorganization and restructuring costs from both years, operating expenses were down 1%.  Operating earnings of $1,300 million for 2015 decreased 3% from $1,347 million for 2014. Operating earnings declined due to a lower gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expense leverage. Operating earnings included the charges noted above. Excluding these charges from both years, operating earnings decreased 5%.  Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2015 decreased by 4% to $769 million from $802 million in 2014. The decrease in net earnings primarily resulted from lower operating earnings, partially offset by lower income taxes. Diluted earnings per share of $11.58 in 2015 were 1% higher than $11.45 for 2014, due to lower average shares outstanding.  The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.   Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 % Diluted earnings per share reported $11.58 $11.45 1 % Restructuring (United States) 0.33 Restructuring (Canada) 0.05 Restructuring (Other Businesses) 0.07 Discrete tax items (0.09) Brazil business shutdown - 0.40 Pension change (Fabory) - 0.15 Restructuring (Fabory) - 0.15 Goodwill impairment (Colombia) - 0.11 Subtotal 0.36 0.81  Segment Analysis  United States Net sales were $7,963 million for 2015, an increase of $37 million, or flat when compared with net sales of $7,926 million for 2014. Contributors to the sales performance for 2015 were as follows: Percent Increase Volume 0 Intercompany sales to Zoro 1 Price (1) Total -%  Mid-single-digit sales growth to light manufacturing and government customers and low single-digit growth to commercial services were offset a mid-teen decline in sales to natural resource customers and low-single-digit declines to heavy manufacturing customers and contractors. In 2015, eCommerce sales for the United States business were $3,275 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year and represented 41% of total sales. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales via EDI and electronic purchasing platforms.  The segment gross profit margin decreased 1.0 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily driven by price decreases exceeding product cost decreases and higher sales to lower margin customers.  Operating expenses were up 1% for 2015 versus 2014. Operating expenses included an incremental $96 million in growth-related spending on eCommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain and inventory management solutions, as well as $32 million of charges related to reorganizing the business, including branch closures. Excluding the reorganization costs, operating expenses decreased 1% primarily due to lower employee benefit costs.  For the segment, operating earnings of $1,372 million for 2015 decreased 5% versus $1,444 million in 2014. Excluding the reorganization expenses mentioned above, operating earnings were down 3%. The decline in operating earnings for 2015 was due to a lower gross profit margin, partially offset by positive operating expense leverage.  Canada Net sales were $891 million for 2015, a decrease of $185 million, or 17%, when compared with $1,076 million for 2014. In local currency, sales decreased 5% for 2015. The 17% decrease for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume (14) Foreign exchange (12) Acquisition 5 Price 4 Total (17)%  Sales performance in Canada was driven by mid-teen declines in the oil and gas, contractor, commercial services, heavy manufacturing, resellers and retail markets. Net sales in the agriculture and mining and utilities end markets were up in the mid-single digits. In 2015, eCommerce sales for Canada were $107 million, a decrease of 13% versus the prior year and represented 12% of total sales.  The segment gross profit margin decreased 0.4 percentage points in 2015 versus 2014, primarily driven by product cost inflation exceeding price inflation driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher supplier rebates.  Operating expenses decreased 4% in 2015. In local currency, operating expenses increased 11%, primarily due to higher severance costs related to reorganizing the business, higher depreciation driven primarily by the new DC and incremental costs from the WFS Enterprises Inc. (WFS) acquisition as 2014 included a partial year. Excluding the reorganization costs, operating expenses increased 9%.  Operating earnings of $27 million for 2015 decreased $61 million, or 69%, versus 2014. In local currency, operating earnings decreased 64%. The decrease in earnings was due to lower sales, lower gross profit margins and negative operating expense leverage.  Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include Zoro in the U.S. and operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the newly acquired Cromwell, were $1,406 million for 2015, an increase of $224 million, or 19%, when compared with $1,182 million for 2014. The net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales from Cromwell, Zoro and MonotaRO. The 19% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume/Price 21 Acquisition 12 Foreign exchange (14) Total 19%  Operating earnings for other businesses were $48 million for 2015 compared to a loss of $38 million for 2014. The year 2015 included $6 million of charges for the continuing restructuring of the business in Europe and additional costs to shut down the business in Brazil. The year 2014 included a $29 million charge related to closing the business in Brazil, a $14 million charge related to the transition of the employee retirement plan in Europe, a $12 million impairment charge for the business in Colombia and $10 million in restructuring costs for the business in Europe. Excluding these charges in both years, operating earnings increased $27 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance by MonotaRO and Zoro, partially offset by incremental expenses associated with the single channel online business model in Europe.  Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $50 million of expense in 2015 compared with $13 million of expense in 2014. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Interest income (expense) - net $ (32,405 ) $ (8,025 ) Loss from equity method investment (11,740 ) - Other non-operating income 1,102 483 Other non-operating expense (6,572 ) (5,189 ) Total $ (49,615 ) $ (12,731 )  The increase in expense was driven by higher interest expense from the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June 2015, as well as operating losses from the investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy. As discussed below, the operating losses in this investment were more than offset by energy tax credits that lowered Grainger's tax rate, which provided Grainger with positive net earnings and cash flow. The clean energy investment generated $0.09 per share of earnings for 2015.  Income Taxes  2014 Compared to 2013 Grainger's net sales of $9,965 million for 2014 increased 6% when compared with net sales of $9,438 million for 2013. The 6% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 5 Business acquisition, net of divestitures 1 Price 1 Foreign exchange (1) Total 6%  Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2014. The increase in net sales was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, as well as diversified commercial services customers. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. In 2014, eCommerce sales were $3,575 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year and represented 36% of total sales.  Gross profit of $4,314 million for 2014 increased 4%. The gross profit margin for 2014 was 43.3%, down 0.5 percentage point versus 2013, primarily driven by lower margins from the newly acquired businesses, faster growth with lower margin customers, charges related to closing the business in Brazil and restructuring the business in Europe, partially offset by price inflation exceeding cost inflation.  Operating expenses of $2,967 million for 2014 increased 4% from $2,840 million for 2013. The increase was primarily driven by an incremental $78 million in growth-related spending on eCommerce, new sales representatives, supply chain and inventory management solutions, as well as charges related to closing the business in Brazil, restructuring costs and the transition of the retirement plan in Europe and an impairment charge for the business in Colombia.  Operating earnings of $1,347 million for 2014 increased 4% from $1,297 million for 2013.

Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2014 increased by 1% to $802 million from $797 million in 2013. The increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $11.45 in 2014 were 3% higher than $11.13 for 2013, due to increased net earnings and lower average shares outstanding.  The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure.

History[edit]
The company was founded by William Wallace Grainger in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois. He established the company to provide supplies for businesses. The business was incorporated as W. W. Grainger, Inc., in 1928. Sales in the early days were generated primarily through mail order via post cards and a catalog. The MotorBook, as the catalog was originally called, was the basis for today's Grainger catalog. Grainger headquarters are now located in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1936 Grainger had established 15 branches to improve customer service.
In 1967, Grainger became a publicly traded company. Grainger is a profitable corporation and has increased dividends to its shareholders for forty five consecutive years.[3] The company has grown consistently since becoming public and passed US$10 billion in annual sales in 2016.
Digital Evolution[edit]
In 1996, Grainger launched its first website. The website was a simple page which linked to an electronic catalog. Since that time Grainger.com has evolved into a robust eCommerce platform. In 2016, Grainger was named the 11th largest eCommerce retailer in North America by Internet Retailer[4]. As businesses continued to shift from ordering through traditional channels, such as using phones or visiting branches, to online and onsite channels including websites, eProcurement platforms and inventory management systems, Grainger evolved. In 2016, more than 65 percent of Grainger orders originated via a digital channel (including Grainger.com, inventory management systems, and eProcurement) and more than 85 percent of orders were shipped directly to the customer or made immediately available through onsite services[1]. In 2016, more than 50% of total company revenue was from a digital channel[5].
While Grainger.com serves primarily large and medium customers in the U.S., Grainger's Zoro U.S. brand was launched in 2011 to serve the small business market in the region through a web-only transaction-based model[1]. Grainger has a similar online-only, or single channel, offer in Japan, through a joint venture called MonotaRO.

Electrical Equipment and Supplies

Electrical equipment is vital to every job site. Construction crews need electrical products not only to run their equipment, but to install electrical systems into buildings they create. Industrial building managers need the right wires, fittings and switches to make repairs. Laboratories need circuit breakers and push buttons to create electrical components. Field workers need portable power supplies to keep operations up and running when wired electricity is not available. Whatever your electrical needs, Grainger has you covered.

History[edit]
The company was founded by William Wallace Grainger in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois. He established the company to provide supplies for businesses. The business was incorporated as W. W. Grainger, Inc., in 1928. Sales in the early days were generated primarily through mail order via post cards and a catalog. The MotorBook, as the catalog was originally called, was the basis for today's Grainger catalog. Grainger headquarters are now located in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1936 Grainger had established 15 branches to improve customer service.
In 1967, Grainger became a publicly traded company. Grainger is a profitable corporation and has increased dividends to its shareholders for forty five consecutive years.[3] The company has grown consistently since becoming public and passed US$10 billion in annual sales in 2016.
Digital Evolution[edit]
In 1996, Grainger launched its first website. The website was a simple page which linked to an electronic catalog. Since that time Grainger.com has evolved into a robust eCommerce platform. In 2016, Grainger was named the 11th largest eCommerce retailer in North America by Internet Retailer[4]. As businesses continued to shift from ordering through traditional channels, such as using phones or visiting branches, to online and onsite channels including websites, eProcurement platforms and inventory management systems, Grainger evolved. In 2016, more than 65 percent of Grainger orders originated via a digital channel (including Grainger.com, inventory management systems, and eProcurement) and more than 85 percent of orders were shipped directly to the customer or made immediately available through onsite services[1]. In 2016, more than 50% of total company revenue was from a digital channel[5].
While Grainger.com serves primarily large and medium customers in the U.S., Grainger's Zoro U.S. brand was launched in 2011 to serve the small business market in the region through a web-only transaction-based model[1]. Grainger has a similar online-only, or single channel, offer in Japan, through a joint venture called MonotaRO.

History[edit]
The company was founded by William Wallace Grainger in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois. He established the company to provide supplies for businesses. The business was incorporated as W. W. Grainger, Inc., in 1928. Sales in the early days were generated primarily through mail order via post cards and a catalog. The MotorBook, as the catalog was originally called, was the basis for today's Grainger catalog. Grainger headquarters are now located in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1936 Grainger had established 15 branches to improve customer service.
In 1967, Grainger became a publicly traded company. Grainger is a profitable corporation and has increased dividends to its shareholders for forty five consecutive years.[3] The company has grown consistently since becoming public and passed US$10 billion in annual sales in 2016.
Digital Evolution[edit]
In 1996, Grainger launched its first website. The website was a simple page which linked to an electronic catalog. Since that time Grainger.com has evolved into a robust eCommerce platform. In 2016, Grainger was named the 11th largest eCommerce retailer in North America by Internet Retailer[4]. As businesses continued to shift from ordering through traditional channels, such as using phones or visiting branches, to online and onsite channels including websites, eProcurement platforms and inventory management systems, Grainger evolved. In 2016, more than 65 percent of Grainger orders originated via a digital channel (including Grainger.com, inventory management systems, and eProcurement) and more than 85 percent of orders were shipped directly to the customer or made immediately available through onsite services[1]. In 2016, more than 50% of total company revenue was from a digital channel[5].
While Grainger.com serves primarily large and medium customers in the U.S., Grainger's Zoro U.S. brand was launched in 2011 to serve the small business market in the region through a web-only transaction-based model[1]. Grainger has a similar online-only, or single channel, offer in Japan, through a joint venture called MonotaRO.

History[edit]
The company was founded by William Wallace Grainger in 1927 in Chicago, Illinois. He established the company to provide supplies for businesses. The business was incorporated as W. W. Grainger, Inc., in 1928. Sales in the early days were generated primarily through mail order via post cards and a catalog. The MotorBook, as the catalog was originally called, was the basis for today's Grainger catalog. Grainger headquarters are now located in Lake Forest, Illinois. By 1936 Grainger had established 15 branches to improve customer service.
In 1967, Grainger became a publicly traded company. Grainger is a profitable corporation and has increased dividends to its shareholders for forty five consecutive years.[3] The company has grown consistently since becoming public and passed US$10 billion in annual sales in 2016.
Digital Evolution[edit]
In 1996, Grainger launched its first website. The website was a simple page which linked to an electronic catalog. Since that time Grainger.com has evolved into a robust eCommerce platform. In 2016, Grainger was named the 11th largest eCommerce retailer in North America by Internet Retailer[4]. As businesses continued to shift from ordering through traditional channels, such as using phones or visiting branches, to online and onsite channels including websites, eProcurement platforms and inventory management systems, Grainger evolved. In 2016, more than 65 percent of Grainger orders originated via a digital channel (including Grainger.com, inventory management systems, and eProcurement) and more than 85 percent of orders were shipped directly to the customer or made immediately available through onsite services[1]. In 2016, more than 50% of total company revenue was from a digital channel[5].
While Grainger.com serves primarily large and medium customers in the U.S., Grainger's Zoro U.S. brand was launched in 2011 to serve the small business market in the region through a web-only transaction-based model[1]. Grainger has a similar online-only, or single channel, offer in Japan, through a joint venture called MonotaRO.
