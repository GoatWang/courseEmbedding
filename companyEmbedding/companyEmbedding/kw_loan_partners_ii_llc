						INVESTOR STATUS" section below.

						ACCREDITED INVESTOR STATUS
						To ensure that the offering of Interests in the Fund is 
						exempt from registration under the U.S. Securities Act 
						of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), each investor must

						person (not an entity) who had joint income with his or 
						her spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of preceding

						participant directed employee benefit plan (e.g., many

						joint net worth with his or her spouse, exceeds $1 
						million.

						OTHER ERISA PLAN. An employee benefit plan within the 
						meaning of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income 
						Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) other than a 
						participant directed plan (i) with total assets of at

						(including the decision to purchase Interests) are made 
						by a bank, registered investment adviser, savings and 
						loan association, or insurance company.

						GOVERNMENT BENEFIT PLAN. A plan established and 
						maintained by a state, its political subdivisions (e.g., 
						municipalities), or any agency or instrumentality of a 
						state or its political subdivisions, for the benefit of 
						its employees, with total assets of at least $5 million.

						IRREVOCABLE TRUST. A trust (other than an ERISA employee 
						benefit plan) that (i) is not revocable by its 
						grantor(s), (ii) has at least $5 million of assets, 
						(iii) was not formed for the specific purpose of 
						acquiring Interests, and (iv) is directed by a person 
						who has such knowledge and experience in financial and 
						business matters that such person is capable of 
						evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the 
						Fund.

						NON-PROFIT ENTITY. An organization described in Section 
						501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended

						shown by the organization’s most recent audited 
						financial statements.

						development company as defined in Section 202(a)(22) of 
						the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

						corporation, partnership, or other entity each of whose 
						equity owners’ net worth exceeds $1 million meets this 
						test.
