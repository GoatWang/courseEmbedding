Leslie Trigg is CEO of Outset Medical. Prior to Outset, she was executive vice president at Lutonix, a cardiovascular medical device company acquired by C.R. Bard.Outset's dialysis technology and self-serve model could bring dialysis care into the consumer-product era of healthcare.In a recent interview with Qmed, Trigg pointed out that dialysis treatment is one of the largest areas of healthcare that has been the least touched by new technology and service model innovation. "Patients today in the clinic are still served in essentially the same way they were back in the 1980s," she said.Outset saw an opportunity to introduce a new type of dialysis technology and service model aimed at cost reduction for providers, and a better care experience for patients. The resulting product is a new kind of dialysis machine that could be compared to the Keurig coffee maker in that it offers a single-serving, dialysis-on-demand approach.“It’s sort of the K-Cup of dialysis,” Trigg said.
