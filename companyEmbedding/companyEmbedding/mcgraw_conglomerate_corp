Acquisition of Existing Operations and Revenue Streams:
All target acquisitions, and investments under consideration by McGraw, will be well established in their respective industry, possess a robust revenue stream, and prove capable of long term growth after new investment. McGraw will not acquire, nor invest in, any start up or speculative business operation or entity. 
Diversified Industries and Low Beta Investments:
McGraw intends to invest in businesses across a wide variety of industries, offering the safety net of a diversified portfolio. McGraw will be a safe harbor and hedge against any single market fluctuation, by acquiring equity positions in well-established and profitable businesses in wide ranging business sectors. The company is committed to invest in “low beta” or “low risk” business operations that show very low volatility, and present a steady return over the long term to the average investor. 
Early to Mid-Staged Business Life Cycle Opportunities, Presenting Long View Returns:
McGraw intends to acquire entities who are viewed as in the early or mid-stages of their business life cycle, that present McGraw with an increasing return over the long term. McGraw will not invest in entities who show little or no potential for growth in their main or affiliated lines of business. 
Ethical Standards of Operation:
To be considered for acquisition or investment by McGraw, entities must have proven to operate with the highest ethical standards and be well respected in their industry and with their customer base. 
Key Employee and Management Retention:
McGraw will pursue investments that ensure low turnover among employees and management inside the target business operation. McGraw will aim to retain all current employees, management, and ownership of the target business, to facilitate a smooth transition of ownership with no interruption of sales and operations activities. 
Re-investment Supporting Healthy Company Growth:
McGraw intends to re-invest from profits into The Company and target acquisitions, in support of company personnel and operations. McGraw will maintain balance, seeking the equivalent investment of attention and resources inside the company itself, and among its subsidiaries. We will maintain a positive work environment and seek to grow our respective investments in all aspects of business activities.




Entertainment & Fitness
Entertainment and Fitness Industries have gone hand in hand since the inception of the World Wrestling Entertainment (“WWE”) in 1979. WWE is an American publicly traded company that deals primarily in professional wrestling with major revenue sources also coming from film, music, product licensing and direct product sales.
The Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) is the largest mixed martial arts (“MMA”) promoter in the world and features most of the top-ranked fighters in the sport. UFC recently sold for $4 billion, the most expensive transaction for an organization in sports history. While we may not be as successful, we hope to emulate such models like the WWE and the UFC, McGraw plans to capitalize on this now largely mainstream MMA industry, as a licensed promotion company, and athlete training and recruiting division for the MMA industry. Specifically, McGraw intends to acquire a licensed and proven training center for MMA athletes that supplies professional talent directly to the MMA industry.
McGraw also intends to acquire an MMA events promotion company that would be licensed by one of the existing MMA entities and would be responsible for regional MMA events that would be televised nationwide to a large and growing audience. By entering this space, McGraw believes it will have acquired a highly lucrative component of a wildly successful and profitable industry. Entertainment Fitness has very few corporate players, and McGraw will seek to establish itself as a serious player, incurring only a modest dollar commitment.


 



Financial Services & Insurance Services
Ken McGraw, the Principal of McGraw, has significant experience in the Financial and Banking industries. Mr. McGraw intends (with necessary funding) to acquire a company that offers loans for residential and commercial real estate, small business loans, car loans, as well as Insurance and Re-Insurance Services.
McGraw also intends to acquire, again with adequate funding) a Finance Company as well as an insurance and/or re-insurance operation, Mr. McGraw having extensive prior experience in these Financial Industries. Consequently, we believe the Company will be able to invest wisely in low beta, highly successful operations, showing potential for significant revenue with minimal investment.
McGraw, in addition, intends to seek ways to utilize its holdings in the Finance and Banking sector to reduce the cost of borrowing for all its other acquisitions and holdings.


 



Automotive Services & Dealership Services
Additional business sectors that have traditionally, and recently, proven (in our view) to be a safe harbor for capital investment, are the Automotive Dealership and Dealership Services Industry.
The Company, with adequate funding, expects to acquire an Automotive Dealership Services Company (or companies) to offer on-site dealership services, regionally…if not nationwide. Dealership Services is a niche industry that services auto, boat, and airplane dealerships.
We intend to acquire such dealership services to enrich the automotive holdings for the Company, offering the ability to market goods and services across multiple industry platforms.
McGraw intends to acquire a thriving Automotive Dealership once the adequate funding has been achieved. Pairing Dealership Services with an Automotive Dealership owned by McGraw, will create (in our opinion) a symbiotic revenue relationship that should benefit The Company.


 



Construction & Real Estate
Our analysis suggests that the Construction and Real Estate sectors are showing signs of growth and such market sectors have traditionally been safe harbor investments for long-term investors. Along with traditional construction plans for high-end residential and income-producing commercial buildings.
If successful in its money raise, McGraw plans to operate inside a niche market of the construction industry: medical facilities construction and management. The medical field (especially senior care or “long-term care”), we are convinced, is soon to experience its largest growth cycle in a generation.
We believe the rate of retirees is set to exceed all generations by a large multiple. Very specifically, McGraw plans to combine the stable and increasing construction industry with the stable and high growth long-term care industry.
McGraw intends to join with a well-established and experienced medical group, servicing a significant patient list. The Company (with adequate funding) will be able to build up multiple medical facilities, and grand open each location 100% pre-sold and occupied.
We expect to be able to staff and manage those facilities with properly licensed medical staff and operated by the contemplated partner/joint venture medical group.
Upon completion of each facility, McGraw intends to maintain options to retain ownership of each property and participate in revenue sharing, acting as the landlord, or negotiate a price to sell each property to the occupying medical group at a profit.


 



Oil & Clean Energy
McGraw intends to invest in actively producing oil wells in the southern United States and explore future investments in clean energy production. To be considered, oil fields by McGraw, must be producing hundreds of barrels of American oil every day, and delivering it to refineries at a brisk pace. Such acquisition would, we believe, be consistent with the Company’s objective to invest only in successful, low beta, revenue producing businesses.
In fact, we believe we can acquire operating companies with existing infrastructure, already in place in each location, thereby, in our view, providing McGraw zero startup costs and ensuring all investment dollars from the Company are ‘above ground’ and can contribute to growing an existing revenue stream into a major profit center.
McGraw will also seek acquisitions that contribute to U.S. energy independence in other ways, such as harnessing wind energy. McGraw intends to work with government agencies, and clean energy experts, to decide upon the appropriate course of action for the Company to enter the clean energy industry.
McGraw’s objective, among others, is to help the United States achieve energy independence in an environmentally responsible manner.

ITEM 3.
SUMMARY OF OFFERING
 
The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Offering Circular. Prospective investors should consider carefully the information discussed under “Summary of Offering and Risk Factors.” An investment in our securities presents substantial risks and you could lose all or substantially all of your investment.
 
Basis of Presentation; Explanatory Notes.
 
For interpretative purposes, respective to our responses in this Offering Circular, we consider ourselves a “small business” as that term is defined in 17 CFR 230.157.
 
Advice of Forward-Looking Statements
 
There are various sections of this Offering Circular that contain “forward-looking statements.” We use words such as “believe, “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate”, “plan,” “may,” “will,” and similar expressions (in either their singular or plural forms) to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, projections or estimates concerning any former business or plan of operations, including demand for our products and services, mix of revenue streams, ability to control and/or reduce operating expenses, anticipated operating results, cost savings, product development efforts, general outlook of our business and industry, our business, competitive position, adequate liquidity to fund our operations, and meet our other cash requirements, are inherently uncertain as they are based on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning such future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate and convey by the use of such forward-looking statements and, for many reasons, are subject to certain risks. All forward-looking statements in this Offering Circular are made as of the date hereof, based on information available to us (taking into consideration that certain information is unknown or not available to us) as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or information contained in this Offering Circular.

Table of Contents
 
The following Summary highlights material information contained elsewhere in this Offering Circular. This summary does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in our common stock. Before making an investment decision, you should read the entire Offering Circular carefully, including the “Summary of Risk Factors” section, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section, the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements.
 
Overview 
 
2,500,000 shares of common stock (the “shares”) are being offered hereby by MCGRAW CONGLOMERATE CORPORATION, a development stage Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “McGraw,” “we,” “us” or “our”), on a best-efforts, self-underwritten basis.
 
At the present time, there is no public market for the Company’s securities. An investment in the shares offered for sale under this Offering Circular involves a high degree of risk. You should purchase Company securities only if you can afford losing your entire investment. (See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of this Offering Circular.)
 
Unless earlier terminated, the Initial Offering Period will be up to 90 days from the date hereof unless extended for up to an additional 180 days in the sole discretion of the Company. The Company is offering a minimum of $499,998 up to a maximum of $15,000,000 of such shares. (See “Plan of Distribution.”) The date that (1) subscriptions for a minimum of $499,998 in shares have been received and (2) the Company has accepted such subscriptions, will mark the end of the Initial Offering Period. At such time, funds raised to that point will be released to the Company, until the up to nine (9) month Initial Offering Period is concluded or the Offering is discontinued. As described in greater detail in “Plan of Distribution,” the Offering is being made pursuant to an Offering Circular which may be extended for additional periods which will, in the aggregate, not exceed 24 months from the date of this Offering Circular and only if this Offering Circular and associated Offering Statement is substantially amended (the “Continuous Offering Period”). During the Initial and Continuous Offering Periods (up to 9 and 24 months, respectively), Shares will be offered at $6.00 per share (the “Selling Price”). If a minimum of $499,998 of shares is not sold during the Initial Offering Period (as it may be extended), investor funds held in escrow will be promptly returned, excluding any interest, if any. 
 
The minimum purchase is $1,200 (200 shares); additional purchases by existing Shareholders may be made in increments of $600 or more.

BECAUSE THE MINIMUM CLOSING AMOUNT IS $499,998, INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED TO CAREFULLY EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO FULLY ESTABLISH ITS STATED OBJECTIVES AND TO INQUIRE AS TO CURRENT DOLLAR VOLUME OF SUBSCRIPTIONS.
 
UNTIL SEPTEMBER __, 2017 (90 DAYS AFTER THE DATE HEREOF), ANY BROKER-DEALER EFFECTING TRANSACTIONS IN THE SHARES, WHETHER OR NOT PARTICIPATING IN THIS DISTRIBUTION, MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER A CURRENT COPY OF THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE OBLIGATION OF DEALERS TO DELIVER A COPY OF THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR WHEN ACTING AS UNDERWRITERS AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY UNSOLD ALLOTMENTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS.
 
The following Summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular. All references in this Offering Circular to shares are as of March 31, 2017 unless otherwise specified. Prospective investors should carefully consider the information set forth under the heading “Summary of Risk Factors.” 
 
McGraw is a recently organized Delaware corporation located at 711 Berkshire Court, Downers Grove, Illinois 60516 (Telephone: 888-525-0010). The Company intends, thru its contemplated acquisitions and subsidiaries, to expand existing and profitable business models into more fully developed operations, thereby increasing revenue and profitability of each entity for the benefit of its shareholders. The Company will implement a growth by acquisition model, in pursuit of acquiring profitable companies that are viewed as:
 
1. “Low beta” opportunities, safe havens with low volatility
2. Early in respective business life cycle
3. Unrealized industry growth potential
4. Offering long-term retention of key management and personnel
5. Long term value for shareholders
See “The Business” and “Plan of Distribution.”
 
As an emerging growth company in the early exploration stage, our plan of operations has been structured in a manner that management believes brings the requisite skills and services to the Company in order to operate efficiently and at the same time manage overhead costs. It is anticipated that, unless at least the minimum of this Offering is achieved, the Company will not have any employees beyond its sole officer.

RISK FACTORS 
 
Investing in our shares involves a high degree of risk and many uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks described below along with all of the other information contained in this Offering Circular, including our financial statements and the related notes, before deciding whether to purchase our shares. If any of the adverse events described in the following risk factors, as well as other factors which are beyond our control, actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer significantly. As a result, if and when our common stock is eligible to become quoted, the trading price of our shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The following is a description of what we consider the key challenges and material risks to our business and an investment in our securities.
 
(1) THE PRICE OF THE SHARES OFFERED HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY ESTABLISHED. The $6.00 per share price of the common stock has be established by our current management, considering such matters as the state of the Company’s business development and the general condition of the industry in which it operates. The offering price bears little relationship to the assets, net worth or any other objective criteria.
 
(2) THE COMPANY, IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, HAS A LIMITED HISTORY OF OPERATIONS AND MINIMAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WHICH ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN. IN ADDITION, UNFORESEEN MARKET FLUCTUATIONS CAN ADD TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY’S DEVELOPMENT PLANS. IF ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS REQUIRED BUT NOT OBTAINED, OR MARKET CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE, THE INVESTOR RISKS LOSING ALL OR PART OF HIS INVESTMENT. The Company is in the early stage of development and has only a limited history of operations. (See “The Company.”) 
 
More specifically, to the extent that the Company implements its long-term medical facility construction plans, the Company must engage a licensed medical group and the Company’s business will be subject to the joint venture partnership with the licensed medical group. The Company will also rely on the partnership with the medical group to supply all medical doctors, managers and personnel to the project in the short and long-term, during and after completion of each proposed medical development project. 
 
To the extent that the Company implements its residential real estate development plans, fluctuations in the real estate market could cause delays in the execution of the business plan, the Company’s business will be subject to lack of mortgages for both high-end and affordable homes as well as increased availability of houses on the market which could extend the time that a house remains on the market as well as encountering all of the problems, expenses, delays and risks inherent in a new business enterprise (including limited capital, delays in program development, possible cost overruns, uncertain market acceptance and a limited operating history). (See also below “Risk Factors -- Reliance on Management.”) In addition, the Company’s future success will depend upon factors which may be beyond its control or which cannot be predicted at this time and could cause investors to lose all of their investment.

To the extent that the Company implements its dealership services, auto dealership, entertainment and fitness, oil and clean energy as well as financial and insurance services acquisition plans, the Company’s business will be subject to the target acquisition’s business activities, customer/client retention, customer service and business revenue stability. The Company is subject to the target line of business’s continued communication with the Company’s principals, and legal counsel, to effectively transition ownership and revenue to the Company during the timeframe leading up to the maximum amount to be raised by the Offering, or to the entire purchase price negotiated with the target having been realized, whichever occurs first. 
 
Moreover, the Company will be subject to obtain all necessary federal, state and local permits, licenses and approvals necessary to operate as a licensed financial service, mortgage, or banking entity. The Company’s business is also subject to the current owner’s expertise and assistance in the creation, development and marketing of the new entertainment and fitness business plan. The Company will rely on input and professional relationships provided by the current owner(s), to develop and market the existing televised events, development of the brand name nationwide. With regard to the oil and clean energy line of business, the Company is also subject to the industry professionals currently employed by the target at the oil fields remaining in place, and working for the Company during and after the transition of ownership. The Company might not achieve profitability in the future. If the Company fails to achieve profitability, its growth strategies could be materially adversely affected. (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”)
 
In addition, the Company’s minimal capital resources are not adequate to fully implement its business plan. If the Company achieves only the $499,998 minimum associated with this Offering, the Company is expected to be sustainable for approximately 3-9 months without additional financing. Thereafter, if additional financing is required but not obtained, the investor risks losing all or part of his/her investment. Conversely, if the Company achieves the $15,000,000 maximum associated with this Offering, there will be no additional financing required for the foreseeable future. If additional financing in fact is required, it might not be available to the Company if and when required, or on terms acceptable to the Company. If such additional financing is not available, the Company might have to sell additional stock which might result in substantial dilution of the equity interests of existing shareholders.

(2) GOING CONCERN REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS RAISE DOUBT AS TO THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO CONTINUE OPERATION WITHOUT FUNDS FROM THE OFFERING AND THEREFORE THE INVESTORS COULD LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. The factors described above in “Limited History of Operations” raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In this regard, see the Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants accompanying the Company’s audited financial statements appearing elsewhere herein which cites substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve profitability in the future, if at all. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that the Company’s proposed activities and/or acquisition of majority ownership in the businesses of other companies will be successful or that the Company will be able to achieve or maintain profitable operations. If the Company fails to achieve profitability, its growth strategies could be materially adversely affected. (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Prospective Results of Operations.”)
 
(3) THE RISK OF RELYING ON A MANAGEMENT TEAM WHICH HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY WORKED TOGETHER COULD CREATE INTERNAL CONFLICTS DUE TO DIFFERENT OPERATING STYLES AND PHILOSOPHIES. THE RESULT MAY STALL IMPORTANT BUSINESS DECISIONS AND CREATE POOR WORKING CONDITIONS, SUBSEQUENTLY COSTING THE COMPANY TIME AND MONEY AND POSSIBLY RESULTING IN THE INVESTORS LOSING THEIR INVESTMENT. Although the current principal has had significant cumulative experience and expertise in the identification, acquisition, and operation of various businesses, he has not operated such an extensive array of operations the Company contemplates. For example, the targeted lines of business include owning and managing (under the indicated circumstances and networks of relationships) medical facilities, auto dealers and services, sports entertainment, even oil fields even though the sole principal of the Company has not previously engaged in those activities. Investors will have no right or power to take part in or direct the management of the Company. Accordingly, no investor should purchase shares unless such investor is willing to entrust all aspects of the operations of the Company to current management, including the selection of businesses and/or controlling interests in companies it may acquire, to the Company’s management. This potential risk is even more important in this offering since the Company’s business is dependent to a significant degree upon the performance of its sole principal, Ken McGraw, the departure or disabling of which would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s performance and who is required to devote his services exclusively to the Company. The Company will maintain key man life insurance of $1,000,000 on Mr. McGraw, application for which will made after the Company has raised $10,000,0000 in this Offering. Such key employee could leave the Company. Therefore, the investors are at risk for losing some or all of their investment if the key employees leave the Company before the management team develops redundancy for those employees.

(4) BASED ON THE BROAD DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE IS ASSOCIATED RISK REGARDING THE USE OF PROCEEDS, SUBSEQUENTLY CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MANAGEMENT TO DEPLETE THE OPERATING CAPITAL IN VENTURES THAT DO NOT RETURN ENOUGH PROFITS TO FUND OPERATIONS, WHICH IN TURN COULD CAUSE THE INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. A portion of the net proceeds of this Company have been allocated to working capital and, among other things, to expand its contemplated real estate-related activities and/or acquisition of majority interest in the businesses of other companies. While the Company expects to use proceeds of this Offering as outlined in “Application of Proceeds,” management of the Company retains broad discretion as to the specific use of such funds. That discretion could cause the investor to lose all or part of their investment.
 
(5) FUTURE EXPANSION MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE OR PROFITABLE DUE TO A POTENTIAL LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION OR FINANCIAL OVER-EXTENSION OF THE COMPANY WITH NO PROFITS TO REINVEST FOR SUSTAINABILITY. IN THE EVENT OF EITHER, INVESTORS COULD LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. As a result of this Offering, the Company is expected to expand into activities in which management has not previously operated and anticipates generally experiencing significant expansion. This includes expansion into entertainment via television. With no experience by the current management in this and other areas (automotive, financial services, food manufacturing and distribution, for instance), the Company could have difficulty in finding management personnel that could effectively operate the associated activities and therefore could cause the loss of the investment into those sectors. To reduce that potential risk, and to tap into pre-existing expertise, the Company will typically enter into joint ventures and/or purchase agreements with time tables for acquisition, only with established firms whose senior management and/or ownership have agreed to long-term employment contracts with the Company. It is possible (as a result of these recent preliminary activities -- and potential future projects and joint ventures) that the Company’s management will be required to manage larger business operations than historically has been the case. It is possible that the Company will fail at its attempts to effectively implement the organizational and operational systems necessary for optimal management integration of its expanded activities, which could cause a loss of the investor’s money.

Table of Contents
 
(6) FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT THOROUGH DUE DILIGENCE MAY RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT DEPLETE THE WORKING CAPITAL TO THE POINT THAT THE COMPANY CANNOT RECOVER AND SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. To expand its market and diversify its business mix, the Company’s business strategy includes growth through acquisitions and joint ventures. If there are no future acquisitions, if there are future acquisitions that are consummated on terms unfavorable to the Company or if any newly acquired companies are unsuccessfully integrated into the Company’s operations, the investor could lose all of their money. As the Company may use equity or incur long-term indebtedness or a combination thereof for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid in conjunction with any future expansion, acquisitions or joint ventures, the Company could lose its ability to continue operations and the investor could lose their investment money.
 
(7) THERE IS RISK ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED COMPETITION FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE COMPETITORS THAT MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY AND CAUSE INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. The Company’s business plan spans construction, real estate development, financial services, entertainment, fitness and energy, which in some cases overlap and are highly competitive. The Company faces substantial competition from a number of well-established, well-financed companies, many of whom have greater resources and are more established than the Company. Increased competition by existing and future competitors in the real estate, construction, communications, and financial services sectors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve profitability. 
 
(8) NO MARKET STUDIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS, AND WITHOUT PREPARATION OF A FEASIBILITY TOOL, THE COMPANY COULD EXHAUST ALL ITS CAPITAL TRYING TO MAKE THE BUSINESS WORK AND THE INVESTORS WOULD LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. In formulating its business plan, the Company has relied on the judgment of its management. No formal, independent market studies concerning the demand for the Company’s proposed acquisitions have been conducted; however, market studies are expected to be employed in the future. Directly or indirectly, the Company will use a significant portion of the proceeds of this Offering to validate the legal and economic feasibility of its business plan. To the extent that the Company determines any or a part of its business plan is not feasible, or to the extent the Company is unable to make a determination of feasibility and/or to modify its business plan, the Company will be unable to proceed to develop in accordance with its business plan and investors may lose their entire investment in the Company.

(9) THE COMPANY’S SERVICES WILL EXTEND TO DOMESTIC AREAS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, WHICH CARRIES SUBSTANTIAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESPECTIVE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. DECLINING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN POTENTIAL DECREASED CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY WITH LITTLE TO NO WARNING AND MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME, WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. There is no prior proof of the acceptance of the Company’s contemplated business plan. The Company intends to commence operations at a time when the industries affected by consumer products (and especially services) are rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants. As is typical of new and rapidly evolving industries, demand, and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services is subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk. Because the market for certain of the Company’s contemplated products and services is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict the future growth rate, if any, and size of the market for a given line of business. 
 
(10) BRAND DEVELOPMENT AND BRAND ACCEPTANCE IS DIFFICULT TO CREATE AND, IF NEGATIVE BRANDING OCCURS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING FUTURE SALES AND PUTTING THE INVESTORS AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR INVESETMENT. The Company believes that establishing and maintaining a brand identity is a critical aspect for attracting and expanding its targeted audience and that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the growing number of competitive products and services expected to result from the companies expected to be acquired. Promotion and enhancement of the Company’s brand will depend largely on its success in continuing to provide high quality products and services at the subsidiary level. If the Company is unable to provide high quality services or otherwise fails to promote and maintain its brand to its intended customer base, incurs excessive expenses in an attempt to improve or promote and maintain its brand, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and investors could lose their investment.
 
(11) THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO DIRECT GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ITS ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICES IN ANY LINES OF BUSINESS IN WHICH IT WILL OPERATE. THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES POSE A CERTAIN RISK WHICH MAY IMPACT THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY THE COMPANY, INCREASE ITS COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSE THE INVESTOR TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. In light of laws and regulations currently applicable directly to consumer products and services, the Company and/or the lines of businesses expected to be acquired are s subject to direct government regulation in certain portions of its contemplated activities as well as regulations applicable generally to business. It is beyond the scope of this discussion to go into all applicable laws and regulations that may impact the Company, especially if the Company ramps up (as expected) its ambitious business plan. The Company and/or the lines of businesses it seeks to acquire will initially be subject mainly to those regulations generally applicable to business, including:
 




~

The affected subsidiary will have to comply with regulations regarding the wholesale purchase of vehicles in any state in which it has a physical presence and have liability insurance on the business property.
  


 

16


 

Table of Contents

 



~
If the dealership creates a body shop, it will have to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. If the dealership were to open a tag agency, it will have to comply with the regulations regarding tag agencies in the state in which it has a physical presence. More generally, if the Company does not satisfy all governmental regulations associated with the automobile dealership, investors could lose their money.


 

 

~
For the construction business, the Company or the affected subsidiary must meet the regulations for having a licensed general contractor as a qualifier for the Company. Additionally, the construction company must have workers’ compensation insurance for injury on the job or while operating company vehicles, if the company has any. The construction company must also maintain general liability insurance, comply with the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and OSHA regulations.


 

 

~
If the Company enter the financial services sector as contemplated, a number of laws or regulations may be adopted in the future that will have an impact on the Company’s business model and operations. The Company will be required to obtain the necessary federal, state and local licenses to act in the capacity of a lender. The adoption of new laws or the adaptation of existing laws which impact the services offered by the Company, change the way in which the Company planned to do business, which could decrease the demand for the Company’s services and businesses, increase the cost of the Company doing business and therefore cause the investor to lose their investment.


 

 

~
For the oil and clean energy sector, federal and state regulations are subject to change and may affect business operation negatively. Federal guidelines may impose new or arduous requirements that cause the Companyto significantly change its operation to cope with changes in the laws. Significant safety protocols are in place to protect the business and its employees, and all measures must be taken to ensure workplace safety standards are upheld. Changes to any requirement by federal, state or local governments, can significantly affect the Company, its operations and its revenue, and therefor cause the investor to lose their investment.

(12) THE COMPANY MAY NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO BE PROFITABLE AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, IF ANY, IS ENTIRELY AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT. DIVIDENDS MAY BE FURTHER RESTRICTED UNDER FUTURE CREDIT OR OTHER FINANCING AGREEMENT, AND SHAREHOLDERS MAY NOT RECEIVE DIVIDENDS AND/OR COULD LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. Payment of dividends, if any, to shareholders is entirely at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company’s (or desired acquisitions’) products and services and may not be accepted in the marketplace, and there would subsequently be insufficient revenues generated for the Company to be profitable. Not only has the Company not paid any dividends to date, it anticipates that, for the foreseeable future, it will retain any earnings for use in the operation and future expansion of its business activities. Moreover, the Company may be restricted from paying dividends to its shareholders under future credit or other financing agreement(s). (See “Absence of Public Market and Associated Illiquidity of Shares.”)
 
(13) THE COMPANY INTENDS TO LIST SHARES FOR TRADING ON ANY AVAILABLE SECONDARY MARKET. HOWEVER, UNTIL A MARKET DEVELOPS, A PURCHASER MAY BE UNABLE TO LIQUIDATE THEIR INVESTMENT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON AND THE SHARES MAY NOT BE READILY ACCEPTED AS COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN. LIQUIDITY OF THE TRADING MARKET FOR THE SHARES AND AN ACTIVE ONGOING PUBLIC MARKET CANNOT BE GUARANTEED. IF AN ACTIVE PUBLIC MARKET DOES NOT DEVELOP OR IS NOT MAINTAINED, THE MARKET PRICE AND LIQUIDITY OF THE SHARES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED CAUSING INVESTORS TO LOSE THEIR INVESTMENT. The Company’s shares are not publicly traded and are not likely to be traded initially. (See “Plan of Distribution.”) Such a publicly traded status requires the Company to enlist broker-dealers to serve as market makers. Even if found, any market maker of the Company’s shares may discontinue such activities at any time without notice. The Company intends to list the shares for trading on any available secondary market or quotation system as early as possible. However, until a market for its shares develops, a purchaser may be unable to liquidate his or her investment. Liquidity of the trading market for the shares and an active ongoing public market cannot be guaranteed. If an active public market does not develop or is not maintained, the market price and liquidity of the shares may be adversely affected. Consequently, holders of shares acquired pursuant to this Offering may not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency or for any other reason, and the shares may not be readily accepted as collateral for a loan. (See “Investment Requirements.”)

(14) CYCLICALITY OF BUSINESS AND REVENUES IN THESE SECTORS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SEVERE DOWNTURNS BASED ON MARKET AND ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OUT OF THE COMPANY’S CONTROL THAT COULD RESULT IN INVESTORS LOSING ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT. While not anticipated, revenues of the Company, as well as those of the services portion of its lines of business generally, could be cyclical. Most industries and entities the Company seeks to acquire will have stable and producing services that span decades with a loyal customer base. However, demand for any product or service is subject to market conditions and could cause a downturn for the Company and its subsidiaries. This could be reason for the investor to lose their investment. 
 
(15) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN STATUTORY REGISTRATION; NEITHER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 NOR THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 APPLY TO THE COMPANY; INVESTORS EXPECTING PROTECTION UNDER THOSE ACTS WILL NOT HAVE SUCH PROTECTION AND THEREFORE COULD LOSE THEIR INVESTMENTS. Neither the management nor the Company is (nor does management believe it is required to be) registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, each as amended; therefore, purchasers of the shares will not be afforded any protection provided by those Acts. The Company intends to examine opportunities that, if pursued, may become wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company; alternatively, those pursued activities may take the form of providing, directly or indirectly, financing and/or providing management services to affiliated or non-affiliated companies. Under pertinent operating criteria, the Company intends to conduct its operations so that it does not come under the regulation of the respective Investment Advisers and Investment Company Acts of 1940, both as amended, in all cases having an interest of no less than 50% + one (1) share.
 
(16) THERE IS NO DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE OFFERING PRICE OF THE SHARES AND THE COMPANY’S ASSET VALUE, NET WORTH, EARNINGS OR ANY OTHER ESTABLISHED CRITERIA OF VALUE. THE PRICE OF THE SHARES IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE PRICE AT WHICH THE SHARES MAY BE TRADED. INVESTORS PURCHASING SHARES UNDER THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION OF A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN SHARE PRICE AND COMPANY VALUE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT. The offering price of the shares offered hereby has been determined by management of the Company and bears no direct relationship to the Company’s asset value, net worth, earnings or any other established criteria of value. Therefore, the price of the shares is not necessarily indicative of the price at which the shares may be traded following the consummation of this Offering.

(17) IMMEDIATE DILUTION WILL OCCUR; COMPANY SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO DIMINUTION OF VALUE UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 95.64%. PER SHARE SINCE SHARES ARE NOT BASED ON THE COMPANY’S ASSET VALUE. THEREFORE, THE INVESTORS MAY IMMEDIATELY LOSE MOST OF THEIR INVESTMENT PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF ACTIVE OPERATIONS. This Offering will result in immediate and substantial dilution of the net tangible book value per common share. Investors who purchase shares offered hereby will experience immediate dilution based on the difference between the subscription price and the net tangible book value per common share. 
 
(18) PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER (RETAINING 40% OF THE SHARES IF THE MAXIMUM OFFERING IS ACHIEVED AND UP TO 95.24% IF ONLY THE MINIMUM OFFERING IS ACHIEVED) MAY BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME OF ALL MATTERS SUBMITTED FOR A VOTE, INCLUDING THE ELECTION OF THE COMPANY’S DIRECTORS. SUCH CONTROL BY THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER MAY POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS REGARDING ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CHANGE OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND SHARE PREMIUMS, AND INVESTORS MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THEIR INVESTMENT. Prior to the offering, Ken McGraw (the sole director and officer and majority shareholder, the “Principal Stockholder”) owned in the aggregate 100% (1,666,667) of the Company’s outstanding shares on the date of this Offering Circular. (See “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.”) Upon completion of the offering, the Principal Stockholder’s aggregate share ownership in the Company will permit him to retain not less than 40% of the Shares, assuming the $15,000,000 maximum is raised. Consequently, the Principal Stockholder may be able to effectively control the outcome on all matters submitted for a vote to the Company’s stockholders for the foreseeable future (particularly if significantly less than the $15,000,000 maximum is raised). Specifically, at least initially, the Principal Stockholder may be able to elect all of the Company’s directors. Such control by the Principal Stockholder may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the Company, including transactions in which holders of shares might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.

(19) ANY SUBSTANTIAL SALE OF STOCK BY EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK, THEREBY DEVALUING THE MARKET PRICE AND CAUSING INVESTORS TO RISK LOSING ALL OR PART OF HIS INVESTMENT. All shares held by the Principal Stockholder are “restricted” and/or “control” shares as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”). This Rule also extends to non-affiliates of the Company with regard to restricted shares, that is those not freely tradable. All of these restricted shares have been owned beneficially for more than one year by existing shareholders and may not be sold in the market pursuant to Rule 144 until at least one year has passed from the date of their purchase (or six (6) months in the case of a reporting company), if so reporting for at least 90 days. The Company can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the shares prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for the shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate.
 
(20) WE MAY EXPERIENCE RISKS ASSOCIATED IF OUR SHARES WERE CLASSIFIED AS “PENNY STOCK” ONCE OUR COMMON STOCK BEGINS TRADING. At $6.00 per share, the Company’s shares would not be deemed “penny stock” as defined. Once our common stock is quoted over-the-counter, if at all, subject to the Commission’s acceptance of our Regulation A+ Offering and FINRA’s permission to have a symbol issued and our stock quoted, our stock will not subject to “penny stock” rules as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 3a51-1 unless the share price will have dropped at the time of the trading market commencing. If that were the case, because of the constraints on trading resulting from the “penny stock” definition, investors may encounter difficulty in selling their stock. The Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. We do not currently anticipate that our common stock will be subject to these penny stock rules. Transaction costs associated with purchases and sales of penny stocks are likely to be higher than those for other securities that are listed on a national, regional or international stock exchange. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ proprietary system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).

Table of Contents
 
The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document to its customer that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation.
 
In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common shares in the United States and shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares.
 
(21) ONCE TRADING COMMENCES, THE PRICE OF OUR SHARES MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY. In recent years, the securities markets in the United States and Canada, particularly in respect of mining companies, have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market price of securities of many mineral exploration companies have experienced wide fluctuations in price which have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset values, or prospects of such companies. The price of our common shares is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in the price of capital, or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports. Other factors unrelated to our performance that may have an effect on the price of our common shares, once they are trading, if at all, include the following: the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow our securities; lessening in trading volume and general market interest in our securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade significant numbers of our common shares; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities; and a substantial decline in the price of our common shares that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity.

ITEM 4.
DILUTION 
 
Dilution represents the difference between the offering price per share and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and intangible assets from total assets. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholders.
 
Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered. As a result of there being no established public market for our shares, the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to our shares have been arbitrarily determined by the Company and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective criteria of value. In addition, no investment banker, appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares.
 
As of April 26, 2017, the net tangible book value of our shares of common stock was $(42,543) (and accordingly $(0.0255) per share based upon 1,666,667 shares outstanding prior to this Offering.
 
If you invest in our shares, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our capital stock after this offering. Our net tangible book value as of April 26, 2017 was $(42,543), or $(0.0255) per share of outstanding common stock. Without giving effect to any changes in the net tangible book value after April 26, 2017 other than by the sale of 2,500,000 shares in this offering at the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, our pro forma net tangible book value as of 90 days following the effectiveness of this offering will be $14,957,457 or $3.5898 per share of outstanding common stock. Dilution in net tangible book value per share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by the purchasers of our shares in this Offering and the net tangible book value per share of our capital stock immediately afterwards. This represents an immediate increase of $3.6153 per share of capital stock to existing shareholders and an immediate dilution of $2.4102 per share of common stock to the new investors. The following table illustrates this per share dilution:

The applicable percentages of ownership are based on an aggregate of 1,666,667 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on April 26,2017. 
 
Future Dilution.
 
For business purposes, we may from time to time issue additional shares, which may result in dilution of then existing shareholders. Dilution is a reduction in the percentage of a stock caused by the issuance of new stock. While not applicable at this time, dilution can also occur when holders of stock options (such as company employees) or holders of other optionable securities exercise their options. If in the future the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder will own a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the Company, making each share less valuable. Dilution may also reduce the value of existing shares by reducing the stock’s earnings per share. There is no guarantee that dilution of the common stock will not occur in the future.

Shares Eligible for Future Sale.
 
Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect prevailing market prices. Furthermore, since only a limited number of shares may be available for sale shortly after this Offering because of contractual and legal restrictions on resale described below, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market after the restrictions lapse could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock as well as our ability to raise equity capital in the future.
 
As of April 26, 2017, we had outstanding 20,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and no outstanding shares of preferred stock. All of the shares sold in this Offering will be freely tradable unless held by an affiliate. An additional number of shares will generally become available for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter upon expiration of their respective holding periods under Rule 144 discussed below, a portion of which will be subject to Rule 144 volume limitations.
 
Rule 144.
 
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, beginning 90 days after the effective date of the Offering of which this Offering Circular is a part, any person who is not deemed to have been a Company affiliate for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned their shares for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, may sell shares without restriction, subject to the Company’s compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. In addition, under Rule 144, any person who is not an affiliate of ours and has held their shares for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares immediately upon the closing of this Offering without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144.

Table of Contents
 
In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates who beneficially owns shares that were purchased from us, or any affiliate, at least six months previously, are entitled to sell upon expiration of any lock-up agreements, within any three-month period beginning 90 days after the date of this Offering Circular, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:
 




 
·
1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering; or


 

 

 


 
·
If exchange traded, the average weekly trading volume of our common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.
 
Sales of restricted shares under Rule 144 held by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to requirements regarding the manner of sale, notice, and the availability of current public information about us. Rule 144 also provides that affiliates relying on Rule 144 to sell shares of our common stock that are not restricted shares must nonetheless comply with the same restrictions applicable to restricted shares, other than the holding period requirement.
 
ITEM 5.
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
 
This Offering will remain open for 90 days following its qualification and will terminate on September __, 2017, unless extended by us for up to an additional 180 days or terminated sooner by us in our discretion regardless of the amount of capital raised.

The applicable portions of the rule state that associated persons (including companies) of an issuer shall not be deemed brokers if they (a) perform substantial duties for the issuer; (b) are not broker dealers; and (c) do not participate in selling securities more than once every 12 months, except for any of the following activities: (i) preparing written communication, but no oral solicitation; or (ii) responding to inquiries provided that the content is contained in the applicable Offering Circular; or (iii) performing clerical work in effecting any transaction.

ITEM 6.
USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
We are offering for sale a total of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at a fixed price of $6.00 per share for the duration of this Offering. There is a $499,998 (83,333 share) minimum offering.

Table of Contents
 
The above table is intended to provide an overview of the contemplated application of proceeds over time, as a function of the success of the Offering’s raise and having already performed due diligence:
 
Dealership Services (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The Company expects to be able to acquire an automotive dealer service company (or companies) to offer on-site dealership services nationwide. Per the table above, we intend to invest $2,000,000 in dealership services if the mid-point is reached; $3,000,000 if the maximum is achieved; but $-0- if only the minimum is achieved. 
 
Automotive Dealerships (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The Company expects to be able to acquire an auto dealership (or, over time, dealerships) that deliver high volume car sales. Per the table above, we intend to invest $1,000,000 in an auto dealership if the maximum is achieved but $-0- if only the minimum or mid-point is reached. 
 
Financial and Insurance Services (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The Company intends to offer loans for residential and commercial real estate, small business loans, car loans and business consulting services. More specifically, the Company plans to acquire a mid-sized nationwide insurance and/or re-insurance operation if the mid-point or maximum offering is reached, namely $200,000 if the mid-point is achieved and $300,000 if the maximum achieved but $-0- if only the minimum is achieved. 
 
Construction and medical physician’s management company (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): Expected to be a joint venture to construct and manage medical facilities needed to house 300+ patients to supply technically modern, long-term health care facilities to the Midwest region. That contemplated joint venture is not expected to be pursued unless the maximum is achieved, in which case the Company has reserved $1,000,000 for such effort.

Table of Contents
 
Residential and commercial construction company (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The construction company sought would be committed to construction of townhome and single family detached housing. If the minimum is reached, the Company intends to invest $400,000. If the mid-point or maximum is reached, the Company intends to invest $3,000,000. 
 
Entertainment and Fitness (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The Company believes it has the capacity to acquire an MMA training center and a nutrition company to offer licensed, sanctioned and televised professional UFC events along with world class professional coaching, recruiting of athletic talent and high grade nutrition products. Management believes that MMA has gone mainstream and acquisitions of these lines of business would allow the Company to capitalize on this niche inside the entertainment and fitness industry. If successful in getting this toehold position, the Company would seek to utilize this nationwide television advertising platform to cross market all other Company holdings. To that end, the Company would invest $250,000 if the mid-point is reached and $400,000 if the maximum is achieved—but $-0- if only the minimum offering is reached. 
 
Oil Production and Clean Energy (as described in greater detail in “The Business”): The Company believes it can acquire oil field and energy operations in the U.S. as well as identification of renewable energy construction locations for wind and solar energy projects to be subsidized by the U.S. government. Existing oil fields are on shore in the southern United States and are actively pumping and producing hundreds of barrels of oil per day. Believing that oil and clean energy companies with adequate funding offer attractive returns on investment, the Company (directly or through operating subsidiaries) intends to engage oil industry scientists, geologists, and energy experts to ensure stable and increasing production with the drilling of additional wells on current multi acre sites. Given the dollar commitments required, the Company will invest $1,500,000 if the mid-point of the offering is achieved and $5,000,000 if the maximum is raised—but $-0- if only the minimum is raised.
 
Said another way, management believes the following is achievable if the $500,000 minimum is achieved: 
 





 
·
Secure controlling interest in commercial/residential construction company


 
·
Secure property for construction projects.


 
·
Secure operational control of commercial and residential construction projects


 
·
Secure construction management team


 
·
Secure medical operations management team

The following is achievable, in management’s opinion, if the $7,750,000 mid-point is achieved:
 





 
·
Secure controlling interest in dealership services company

·

ITEM 7.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
 
McGraw has identified business sectors that have traditionally been, and recently proved to be, safe harbors for capital investment--assuming a viable business vehicle is acquired. Those lines of business include automotive dealerships, automotive services, construction, oil and clean energy, financial services, and insurance services; industries management deems mainstays in the current economy, and well understood business models to the average investor. McGraw can be viewed as seeking out existing companies in lines of business with a low beta (or risk) inside industries that have large upside potential, including the automotive industry. By way of example, dealership services is a niche industry that services auto, boat and airplane dealerships which management believes will enrich the automotive holdings for the Company, offering the ability to market goods and services across multiple industry platforms.
 
The Company believes that the construction and real estate sectors are showing signs of growth and such market sectors have traditionally been safe harbor investments for long-term investors. Along with traditional construction plans for high end residential and income producing commercial buildings, McGraw plans to operate inside a niche market of the construction industry: medical facilities construction. In management’s opinion, the medical field (especially senior care or “long-term care”) is soon to experience its largest growth cycle in a generation. We believe the rate of retirees is set to exceed all generations by a large multiple. McGraw plans to combine the stable and increasing construction industry with the stable and high growth long-term care industry. Management believes it can join with a well-established and experienced medical group, servicing a significant patient list, the Company (with adequate funding) will be able to build up multiple medical facilities, and grand open each location at 100% pre-sold and occupied. We expect to be able to staff and manage those facilities with properly licensed medical staff and operated by the contemplated partner medical group. Upon completion of each facility, McGraw intends to maintain options to retain ownership of each property and participate in revenue sharing, acting as the landlord, or negotiate a price to sell each property to the occupying medical group at a profit.
 
Entertainment and fitness industries have gone hand in hand since the inception of the World Wrestling Entertainment (“WWE”) in 1979. WWE is an American publicly traded company that deals primarily in professional wrestling with major revenue sources also coming from film, music, product licensing and direct product sales. The Ultimate Fighting Championship (“UFC”) is the largest mixed martial arts (“MMA”) promoter in the world and features most of the top-ranked fighters in the sport. UFC recently sold for $4 billion, the most expensive transaction for an organization in sports history. Like the WWE and the UFC, McGraw plans to capitalize on this now mainstream industry, as a licensed promotion company and athlete training and recruiting division for the UFC. McGraw intends to acquire a licensed and proven training center for UFC athletes that would supply professional talent directly to the UFC. McGraw also intends to acquire a UFC events promotion company that is currently licensed by the UFC and is responsible for regional UFC events that are televised nationwide to an audience of millions.

Table of Contents
 
McGraw through this Offering believes it can control one (or more) gym, athlete, promotion company, regional televised events, and long-term marketing rights. McGraw intends to capitalize on the public success of current entertainment and fitness operations in a way that benefits its shareholders with long-term returns and the potential of large-scale growth. McGraw expects revenue from the management of pro athletes, hosting of regional UFC events and televised advertising of events resulting in the sale of ancillary products and services associated with this sport. Nutrition products, sportswear, promotional items, and logo wear are expected to generate growing revenue as the Company becomes closely associated with the UFC and its global advertising and marketing network in participation with UFC industry experts.
 
Oil wells in the United States have contributed to the successful bid for the U. S. to become energy independent. To do its part for our common goal of energy independence for the U.S., McGraw intends to invest in actively producing oil wells in the southern United States. These oil fields will need to be producing hundreds of barrels of American oil up from the ground every day, and delivering it to refineries. This will be consistent with the Company’s objective to invest only in successful, low risk, revenue producing businesses. In fact, we believe we can acquire operating companies with existing infrastructure, already in place in each location, thereby providing McGraw zero startup costs and ensuring all investment dollars from the Company are ‘above ground’ and can contribute to growing an existing revenue stream into a major profit center for the Company. As this business sector grows, as we believe will happen, McGraw will pursue other options that also contribute to U.S. energy independence, such as harnessing wind energy. For example, the Company will seek to work with government, and clean energy experts, to devise a plan for the Company to enter this sector of the clean energy industry. The U.S. government has many opportunities for business entities to qualify for grants, direct and tax subsidies, for the development of clean energy development. The Company intends to explore all such options and decide on the best entry point or path forward in helping achieve energy independence for the country in an environmentally responsible manner.
 
There are certain key corporate and management philosophical tenets that the Company’s founder believes are key to the long-term success of the Company:
 




 
·
To achieve commercial success in its individual lines of businesses it intends to own and manage, the Company must have majority control (at least 50% plus 1 share) of these operations.


 
·
Because the Company will focus on our vision to maximize shareholder value, it is in the long-term best interests of the Company, both for its own growth and in developing value for its shareholders, to develop strategies to maximize overall participation in the broadest-based business activities possible.

The Board will hold regular quarterly meetings organized by a company executive, acting as the facilitator.

ITEM 8.
DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY

Our office address is 711 Berkshire Court, Downers Grove, Illinois 60516. Our telephone number is (888) 525-0010. Currently, this space is sufficient to meet our needs. We do not foresee any significant difficulties in obtaining any required additional space if needed. We do not own any real property.
 
ITEM 9.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
This section of the Offering Circular includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Offering Circular. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our forecasts.
 
We are a start-up, exploration stage company and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business operations to date.
 
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next 12 months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we begin operations that produce revenues. Accordingly, we must raise cash as contemplated in this Offering. That cash must be raised from other sources to implement our business plan and stay in business.
 
To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this Offering. We cannot guaranty that we will be able to raise enough money through this Offering to stay in business and we do not know how long we can satisfy our cash requirements. Whatever money we do raise will be applied to payment of expenses of this Offering, due diligence on potential acquisitions that meet our investment requirements and working capital. If we do not raise all of the money we need from this Offering, we will have to find alternative sources, like a private placement of securities or loans from our officers or others. We have discussed this matter with our officers, however, our officers are unwilling to make any commitment to loan us any money beyond organizational costs and expenses at this time. Even if there is a need for additional money, there is no assurance that the current and/or future officers and directors will loan additional money to us. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this Offering. If we need additional cash and can’t raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Other than as described in this section, we have no other financing plans.

Table of Contents
 
A description of our plan of operations is located below. We will be conducting research in connection with the business plan here outlined. 
 
Currently, our only employee is the sole officer and director. As other officers are added (based on funding or cash flow) will be devoting full or part time to our business. There duties will be to handle our day-to-day administration and perform executive functions. We intend to hire third party independent contractors to the extent personnel are required but any such third party independent contractors will be under our officers’ and directors’ direct supervision. As of the date of this Offering Circular, we have no contractors or consultants and we do not intend to do so until we have completed this Offering.
 
Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital.
 
There is no historical financial information about us upon which you can base an evaluation of our performance. We are an exploration stage company and have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and prosecution of our acquisitive capital intensive business plan. To become profitable and competitive, we must execute on our business plan. We are seeking equity financing to provide for the capital required to implement our research and exploration phases.
 
We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.
 
Plan of Operations 
 
The Company was only recently organized, namely October 11, 2016. As reflected in the attached financial statements, the Company has had very limited operations and has had neither revenue nor profits. The purpose of this Offering is to provide working capital for the purposes outlined. At this time, however, the Company has no historical data to discuss.

Table of Contents
 
At present, we expect to generate revenue from the following lines of business:
 




 
·
Construction and sale of single family and multi-family homes


 
·
Construction, leasing and revenue sharing in a long-term medical facility


 
·
Purchase of existing dealership services company with existing revenue stream


 
·
Acquisition of a financial services and insurance company with existing revenue stream


 
·
Acquisition of a sports entertainment company with existing revenue stream


 
·
Acquisition of a producing oil field with existing revenue stream

 
As of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand of $172 for our operational needs. Currently our operating expenses are approximately $1,250 per month. The Company has approximately $42,715 in debts as it begins operations. 
 
We plan to focus our future efforts on construction projects and business acquisitions that will present short term and long-term revenue sources for the Company. We believe using funds to acquire existing businesses with revenue streams will generate both a stable and long-term revenue stream for the Company. 
 
While the construction of single family and multi-family homes presents a modest source of short-term revenue, the construction and full occupancy of a contemplated long-term medical facility is expected to generate significantly greater income and much greater long-term profits.
 
The acquisition of any contemplated producing oil field(s) would provide, in our opinion, immediate revenue. 
 
The acquisition of any contemplated automotive dealership services company will, we believe, also provide immediate revenue from existing sales of the dealership acquired.
 
In our view, the construction of a long-term medical facility will not provide immediate revenue, but does present significant and increasing long-term revenue for the Company.
 
The acquisition of a contemplated financial services and insurance company, we believe, would provide immediate revenue from existing sales of the financial services and insurance company acquired.

In 2006, Mr. McGraw founded Excellent Funding, Inc. in Orland Park, Illinois and Miami, Florida, developing a successful mortgage lending business spanning multiple states. 
 
In 2008 McGraw founded Tiger Capital Management, LLC, a banking and finance consulting firm. From 2008 to date, Mr. McGraw has helped his clients build successful business operations in the areas of banking, finance, mortgage and real estate.

Identification of Significant Employees.
 
We employ no significant employees other than Mr. McGraw, the aforementioned sole officer and director.
 
Family Relationships.
 
We currently do not have any officers or directors who are related to one another.
 
Committees 
 
We do not currently have an audit, compensation, or nominating committee. Our Board of Directors, currently comprised of a sole member, is expected for the foreseeable future to act as a “committee of the whole” board and, as such, is not expected to have separate audit, compensation and nominating committees. Following the completion and effectiveness of this offering and after FINRA permits us to have our securities quoted and issues us a symbol, we intend to include one or more independent directors and intend to adopt a charter for each committee.
 
The audit committee functions being performed by our Board of Directors, currently and for the foreseeable future, requires the oversight and primary responsibility for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors, evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls.
 
The compensation committee functions being performed by our Board of Directors, currently and for the foreseeable future, requires the oversight for implementation and approvals of the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers and periodically reviewing and approving any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements.
 
The nominating committee functions being performed by our Board of Directors, currently and for the foreseeable future, requires selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the Board and its committees.
 
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and reports of change in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities with the Commission. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the Com-mission’s rules and regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Since our inception, and for the foreseeable future, we have not had a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; therefore, compliance with Section 16(a) thereof by our officers and directors is not required.

ITEM 14.
SECURITIES BEING OFFERED
 
Organized in Delaware on October 11, 2016, the Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock (par value of $0.00001) and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock (par value as well of $0.00001). As of April 26, 2017, we had 1,666,667 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
 
We will be applying for a CUSIP identifier for our common stock not later than the closing associated with the Initial Offering Period.
 
Once this Offering is made to become effective by the Commission, we expect to obtain trading authority with FINRA, DTC and a listing on OTCMarkets, an alternative trading platform operated, managed and overseen by OTCMarkets Group, Inc. Although there can be no certainty FINRA will grant us our symbol request, we will apply to have the symbol “MCGR.” 
 
We have not had any trading suspension orders or any other type of administrative action or order issued by the Commission or FINRA at any time from the date of our inception.
 
The shares of our common stock that were issued prior to this Offering, and that are subject to further “insider” restrictions under Rule 144 within the Securities Act of 1933, bear the following restrictive legend: “The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, or applicable state securities laws. The securities have been acquired for investment and not with a view toward resale and may not offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned in the absence of an effective offering for the securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or applicable state securities laws, unless the company has received an opinion of counsel which is satisfactory to the company, to the extent that such registrations are not required.”
 
We have not performed a stock split, paid a stock dividend, effected a recapitalization of our securities, entered into a merger, acquired any material asset, partnership or corporation, effected a spin-off or performed a reorganization from our date of inception and, with the exception of the acquisition of material assets contemplated in this Offering Circular, no such acts or activities in future are being contemplated.

Table of Contents
 
The following is a summary of the rights of our capital stock as provided in our articles of incorporation and bylaws. For more detailed information, please see our articles of incorporation and bylaws, which have been filed as exhibits to the Offering Statement of which this Offering Circular is a part.
 
Common Stock
 
Voting Rights. The holders of the common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders.
 
Dividends. Subject to the rights of holders of the Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation which are by law available therefor, dividends payable either in cash, in property, or in shares of stock, and the holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends (unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in any resolution providing for the issue of a series of Preferred Stock.)
 
Liquidation Rights. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding preferred stock.
 
Absence of Other Rights or Assessments. Holders of common stock have no preferential, preemptive, conversion or exchange rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. When issued in accordance with our articles of incorporation and law, shares of our common stock are fully paid and not liable to further calls or assessment by us.
 
Preferred Stock.
 
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that up to 5,000,000, shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the number of shares constituting each such series and the relative rights, preferences, privileges and immunities, if any, as well as any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares thereof, including the authority to fix and determine the dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions), redemption prices and liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of preferred stock and to increase or decrease the number of shares of any outstanding series, without further vote or action by shareholders.
 


 

53


 

Table of Contents
 
The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable a holder to block such a transaction. In addition, under certain circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. Although our board of directors is required to make any determination to issue preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of our shareholders, our board could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which such shareholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock. Our board presently does not intend to seek shareholder approval prior to the issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules.
 
Board Composition and Filling Vacancies.
 
Our Bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Furthermore, the Bylaws provide that any vacancy on our Board of Directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of our Board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office even if less than a quorum. The limitations on removal of directors and treatment of vacancies, has the effect of making it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors.
 
No Written Consent of Stockholders.
 
Our articles of incorporation do not provide that all stockholder actions are required to be taken by a vote of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting. Delaware law permits a majority of stockholders to take action pursuant to a written consent so long as (i) a majority of shares owned by the stockholders sign the writing, (ii) each signatory dates his signature and (iii) all of the signatures are dated within 60 days of the effective date of the consent. This may limit a stockholder’s access to and the ability of a stockholder to vote on an action being considered by the Company that would otherwise be required to be presented to and voted on at a validly organized meeting of the stockholders. In the future we intend to present to the stockholders a resolution to amend our articles of incorporation that would prohibit written consents by a majority of the stockholders. If adopted by the stockholders, this proposal may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions and would prevent the amendment of our bylaws or removal of directors by our stockholders without holding a meeting of stockholders.
 


 

54


 

Table of Contents
 
Meetings of Stockholders
 
Our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that only a majority of the members of our Board of Directors then in office may call special meetings of stockholders and only those matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders. Our bylaws limit the business that may be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders to those matters properly brought before the meeting.
 
Advance Notice Requirements.
 
Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days or more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. Our bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholders’ notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.
 
Amendment to Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
 
Any amendment of our articles of incorporation must first be approved by a majority of our Board of Directors, and if required by law or our articles of incorporation, must thereafter be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment and a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, except that the amendment of the provisions relating to stockholder action, board composition, limitation of liability, and the amendment of our bylaws and articles of incorporation must be approved by not less than 51% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, and not less than 51% of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class. Our bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, subject to any limitations set forth in the bylaws; and may also be amended by the affirmative vote of at least 51% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, or, if our board of directors recommends that the stockholders approve the amendment, by the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, in each case voting together as a single class.

Table of Contents
 
Undesignated Preferred Stock.
 
Our articles of incorporation, as amended, provide for 5,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable our board of directors to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of our stockholders, our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder group. In this regard, our articles of incorporation grant our board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of these holders and may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us.
 
Shares Eligible for Future Sale.
 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or the perception that these sales could occur in the public market after this offering could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities.
 
Based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2016, upon the closing of this offering, 50,000,000 shares of common stock will be outstanding. The number of shares outstanding upon completion of this Offering assumes:
 




 
·
the issuance of 30,000,000 shares of common stock.


 

 

 


 
·
no issuance or exercise of outstanding options or warrants.

Table of Contents
 
All of the shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable unless purchased by our affiliates. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding after this offering will be restricted as a result of securities laws or lock-up agreements as described below. Following the expiration of the lock-up period, all shares will be eligible for resale in compliance with Rule 144. 
 
Rule 701 Inapplicable 
 
In general, under Rule 701 under the Securities Act, any of our employees, directors, consultants, or advisors who purchased shares from us in connection with a qualified compensatory stock or option plan or other written agreement and in compliance with Rule 701, is eligible to resell those shares 90 days after the effective date of this offering in reliance on Rule 144, but without compliance with the various restrictions, including the holding period, contained in Rule 144. The Company has not adopted such plan and none is currently adopted. 
 
Lock-up and Market Stand-Off Agreements 
 
Our sole director and officer has agreed that he will not sell any common stock for a period of 180 days from the date of this Offering Circular. 
 
Trading Suspensions; Administrative Actions 
 
Neither the Company nor the sole director/officer have had any trading suspension orders or any other type of administrative action or order issued by the Commission or FINRA at any time.
The shares of our common stock that were issued prior to this offering, and that are subject to further “insider” restrictions under Rule 144 within the Securities Act of 1933, bear the following restrictive legend: 
 
“The securities represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, or applicable state securities laws. The securities have been acquired for investment and not with a view toward resale and may not offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned in the absence of an effective offering for the securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or applicable state securities laws, unless the company has received an opinion of counsel which is satisfactory to the company, to the extent that such registrations are not required.”

PART F/S
 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
 
McGraw Conglomerate Corp
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of McGraw Conglomerate Corp. as of April 26, 2017 and the related statement of operations, stockholder's deficit and cash flows for the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of McGraw Conglomerate Corp. as of April 26, 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred a loss since inception, had a net accumulated deficit and may be unable to raise further equity. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 5. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
McGraw Conglomerate Corp (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 11, 2016. It is a development stage company.
 
The Company engages in the business of acquiring income producing business entities during early stages of their respective business life cycle, to enrich the acquisitions business model to result in increased business activity, revenue, and valuation. 
 
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation and Organization 
 
The financial statements of the Company for the period October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents
 
For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. 
 
Use of estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period they are determined.
 
Fair value of financial instruments and fair value measurements
 
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820-10 defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. For certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The carrying amounts of the long-term debt approximate their fair values based on current interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics.

The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:
 




Level 1:

 

Valuations consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and has the highest priority;
 




Level 2:

 

Valuations rely on quoted prices in markets that are not active or observable inputs over the full term of the asset or liability;
 




Level 3:

 

Valuations are based on prices or third party or internal valuation models that require inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and are less observable and thus have the lowest priority.
 
Revenue recognition
 
Revenue from sales of products and services is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products have been shipped or services have been delivered to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
 
Stock-based compensation
 
The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and earned. The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with ASC Topic 505-50.
 
Property, plant and equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for betterments and renewals are capitalized. The cost of property, plant and equipment and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts upon retirement or disposal with any resulting gain or loss being recorded in operations.
 
Intangible assets
 
Intangible assets with no determinable life are initially assessed for impairment upon purchase, with subsequent assessments required annually. When there is reason to believe that their values have been diminished or impaired, a write-down is recognized as necessary. Intangible assets with rights that expire over time are amortized over the time period that the rights exist.
 
Income taxes
 
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change.

The Company adopted “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. These standards provide detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements. Tax positions must meet a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. During the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 no adjustments were recognized for uncertain tax benefits.
 
Basic and diluted earnings per share
 
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, warrants, and stock awards. For the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017, basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.03 per share.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes” (ASU 2015-17), which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet and is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the pronouncement on it’s financial statements.
 
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01), which requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases,” which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. This ASU requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, regarding ASC Topic 230 “Statement of Cash Flows.” This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant effect on its financial statements.
 
NOTE 3: NOTE PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY
 
The Company received $39,999 during the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 from the McGraw Capital Corporation, who owns 100% of the shares of the Company, representing an unsecured note payable bearing interest at 5% per annum. Interest becomes payable along with the principle on December 31, 2017. The Company accrued interest expenses of $526 and paid no interest for the period.
 
NOTE 4: INCOME TAXES
 
The Company had an income tax expense for the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 of $0. The blended Federal and State tax rates for the period of 0% applies to income before taxes. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax liabilities at April 26, 2017 are as follows:

NOTE 5: GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company reported accumulated deficit of $42,743 as of April 26, 2017. To date, the operations have been financed through the loans from related party.
 
In view of the matters described, there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without a significant infusion of capital. At April 26, 2017, the Company had minimal operations. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its plans. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. To the extent that we are required to raise additional funds to acquire properties, and to cover costs of operations, we intend to do so through additional offerings of debt or equity securities. There are no commitments or arrangements for other offerings in place, no guaranties that any such financings would be forthcoming, or as to the terms of any such financings. Any future financing involves substantial dilution to existing investors. 
 
NOTE 6: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
The Company received $39,999 during the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017 from the McGraw Capital Corporation, who owns 100% of the shares of the Company, representing an unsecured note payable bearing interest at 5% per annum. Interest becomes payable along with the principle on December 31, 2017.
 
NOTE 7: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with $0.00001 par. The Company originally contemplated issuing 20,000,000 shares for $200 during the period from October 11, 2016 (inception) to April 26, 2017. The Company later decided that in order to be more marketable to the public, it would change the initial issuance to only 1,666,667 shares for the same $200 cash during the period. 
 
The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with $0.00001 par. No preferred stock has been issued as of April 26, 2017.
 
NOTE 8: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
There have been no significant subsequent events since the balance sheet date.

A conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group, usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries. Often, a conglomerate is a multi-industry company. Conglomerates are often large and multinational.
Conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear/bull market, which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts, sometimes at temporarily deflated values. Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought,[1] ITT Corporation,[1] Litton Industries,[1] Textron,[1] Teledyne.[1] Because of low interest on the loans, the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow. Also, the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market, or capital market, than the smaller firm at their community bank.[citation needed]
For many years this was enough to make the company's stock price rise, as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment. The aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors, who saw a "powerful" and seemingly unstoppable force in business, buy their stock. High stock prices allowed them to raise more loans, based on the value of their stock, and thereby buy even more companies. This led to a chain reaction, which allowed them to grow very rapidly.
However, all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation, conglomerate profits fell. Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased, whereas the rationale for buying a company was that "synergies" would provide efficiency. By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most had been reduced to shells.[2] The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the "typical" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate.
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses.

International[edit]
The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe – Stinnes Enterprises – which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises.
The best known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997.
In Hong Kong, two most well-known conglomerates are the Swire Group and Jardine Matheson, both are British-owned companies that have a history of over 100 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia. Swire Group (or Swire Pacific) controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading. Jardine Matheson operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental).
In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the keiretsu, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsubishi is one of Japan's best known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions.
In China, many of the country's conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China's largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue.[3]
In South Korea, the chaebol are a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK.
The era of Licence Raj (1947–1990) in India created some of Asia's largest conglomerates, such as the Tata Group, Kirloskar Group, Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Sahara India, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance ADA Group, Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group and the Bharti Enterprises.
In Brazil most important conglomerates is J&F Investimentos, Odebrecht, Itaúsa, Camargo Corrêa, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, Queiroz Galvão
In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp & Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil & gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction.
Advantages and disadvantages of Conglomerates[edit]





This section contains a pro and con list, which is sometimes inappropriate. Please help improve it by integrating both sides into a more neutral presentation, or remove this template if you feel that such a list is appropriate for this article. (March 2017)


Advantages[edit]

Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway's construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. Financial Conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups. There are very important opportunities that can be exploited, to increase shareholder value.
A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively.
A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time.[4]

Disadvantages[edit]

The extra layers of management increase costs.[5]
Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate's accounts make them harder for managers, investors and regulators to analyze, and makes it easier for management to hide things.
Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts.
Culture clashes can destroy value.[6][7]
Inertia prevents development of innovation.[8]
Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well.[9]
Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.

Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks.[10]
Media conglomerates[edit]
Further information: Media conglomerate and Concentration of media ownership
In her 1999 book No Logo, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them:

Time Warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. – since 2004.
Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with a large number of concert venues across the U.S. and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications.
Quebecor Media, a Canadian company controlling a subset of TV and radio stations, print magazines and newspaper, software company and a 4-play telecom company
Impact of Conglomerates on the Media: The six major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, General Electric, News Corporation, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. The Walt Disney Company is linked with ABC Television group, creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it directly controls what shows and news is shown. General Electric owns NBC, and does not allow any negative reporting against General Electric on air. Viacom’s chief executive, Sumner Redstone, considers himself a “liberal democrat” and most of the programs shown have a primarily liberal perspective.[11]
Media Conglomerate Impact on Journalism: It leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism. Opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public. The coverage that conglomerates have of issues, especially political, is not necessarily objective, and fails to report both sides of an issue, if not taking a neutral stance.[12] This is known as media bias. Media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists, producers or owners of a media outlet.[11]”

Internet conglomerates[edit]
Although a relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google's parent company[13] belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases Internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several medium-sized online or hybrid online-offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks.[citation needed]
Food conglomerates[edit]
Similar to other industries there are many companies that can be termed as conglomerates.

The Phillip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Phillip Morris International, and Kraft Foods had annual combined turnover of $80 bn.

A conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group, usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries. Often, a conglomerate is a multi-industry company. Conglomerates are often large and multinational.
Conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear/bull market, which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts, sometimes at temporarily deflated values. Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought,[1] ITT Corporation,[1] Litton Industries,[1] Textron,[1] Teledyne.[1] Because of low interest on the loans, the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow. Also, the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market, or capital market, than the smaller firm at their community bank.[citation needed]
For many years this was enough to make the company's stock price rise, as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment. The aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors, who saw a "powerful" and seemingly unstoppable force in business, buy their stock. High stock prices allowed them to raise more loans, based on the value of their stock, and thereby buy even more companies. This led to a chain reaction, which allowed them to grow very rapidly.
However, all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation, conglomerate profits fell. Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased, whereas the rationale for buying a company was that "synergies" would provide efficiency. By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most had been reduced to shells.[2] The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the "typical" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate.
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses.

International[edit]
The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe – Stinnes Enterprises – which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises.
The best known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997.
In Hong Kong, two most well-known conglomerates are the Swire Group and Jardine Matheson, both are British-owned companies that have a history of over 100 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia. Swire Group (or Swire Pacific) controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading. Jardine Matheson operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental).
In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the keiretsu, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsubishi is one of Japan's best known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions.
In China, many of the country's conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China's largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue.[3]
In South Korea, the chaebol are a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK.
The era of Licence Raj (1947–1990) in India created some of Asia's largest conglomerates, such as the Tata Group, Kirloskar Group, Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Sahara India, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance ADA Group, Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group and the Bharti Enterprises.
In Brazil most important conglomerates is J&F Investimentos, Odebrecht, Itaúsa, Camargo Corrêa, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, Queiroz Galvão
In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp & Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil & gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction.
Advantages and disadvantages of Conglomerates[edit]





This section contains a pro and con list, which is sometimes inappropriate. Please help improve it by integrating both sides into a more neutral presentation, or remove this template if you feel that such a list is appropriate for this article. (March 2017)


Advantages[edit]

Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway's construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. Financial Conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups. There are very important opportunities that can be exploited, to increase shareholder value.
A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively.
A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time.[4]

Disadvantages[edit]

The extra layers of management increase costs.[5]
Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate's accounts make them harder for managers, investors and regulators to analyze, and makes it easier for management to hide things.
Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts.
Culture clashes can destroy value.[6][7]
Inertia prevents development of innovation.[8]
Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well.[9]
Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.

Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks.[10]
Media conglomerates[edit]
Further information: Media conglomerate and Concentration of media ownership
In her 1999 book No Logo, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them:

Time Warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. – since 2004.
Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with a large number of concert venues across the U.S. and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications.
Quebecor Media, a Canadian company controlling a subset of TV and radio stations, print magazines and newspaper, software company and a 4-play telecom company
Impact of Conglomerates on the Media: The six major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, General Electric, News Corporation, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. The Walt Disney Company is linked with ABC Television group, creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it directly controls what shows and news is shown. General Electric owns NBC, and does not allow any negative reporting against General Electric on air. Viacom’s chief executive, Sumner Redstone, considers himself a “liberal democrat” and most of the programs shown have a primarily liberal perspective.[11]
Media Conglomerate Impact on Journalism: It leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism. Opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public. The coverage that conglomerates have of issues, especially political, is not necessarily objective, and fails to report both sides of an issue, if not taking a neutral stance.[12] This is known as media bias. Media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists, producers or owners of a media outlet.[11]”

Internet conglomerates[edit]
Although a relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google's parent company[13] belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases Internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several medium-sized online or hybrid online-offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks.[citation needed]

The Phillip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Phillip Morris International, and Kraft Foods had annual combined turnover of $80 bn.

By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most had been reduced to shells.[2] The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the "typical" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate.
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses.

International[edit]
The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe – Stinnes Enterprises – which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises.
The best known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997.
In Hong Kong, two most well-known conglomerates are the Swire Group and Jardine Matheson, both are British-owned companies that have a history of over 100 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia. Swire Group (or Swire Pacific) controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading. Jardine Matheson operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental).
In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the keiretsu, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsubishi is one of Japan's best known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions.
In China, many of the country's conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China's largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue.[3]
In South Korea, the chaebol are a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK.
The era of Licence Raj (1947–1990) in India created some of Asia's largest conglomerates, such as the Tata Group, Kirloskar Group, Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Sahara India, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance ADA Group, Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group and the Bharti Enterprises.
In Brazil most important conglomerates is J&F Investimentos, Odebrecht, Itaúsa, Camargo Corrêa, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, Queiroz Galvão
In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp & Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil & gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction.
Advantages and disadvantages of Conglomerates[edit]

Advantages[edit]

Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway's construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. Financial Conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups. There are very important opportunities that can be exploited, to increase shareholder value.
A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively.
A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time.[4]

Disadvantages[edit]

The extra layers of management increase costs.[5]
Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate's accounts make them harder for managers, investors and regulators to analyze, and makes it easier for management to hide things.
Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts.
Culture clashes can destroy value.[6][7]
Inertia prevents development of innovation.[8]
Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well.[9]
Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.

Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks.[10]
Media conglomerates[edit]
Further information: Media conglomerate and Concentration of media ownership
In her 1999 book No Logo, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them:

Time Warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. – since 2004.
Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with a large number of concert venues across the U.S. and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications.
Quebecor Media, a Canadian company controlling a subset of TV and radio stations, print magazines and newspaper, software company and a 4-play telecom company
Impact of Conglomerates on the Media: The six major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, General Electric, News Corporation, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. The Walt Disney Company is linked with ABC Television group, creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it directly controls what shows and news is shown. General Electric owns NBC, and does not allow any negative reporting against General Electric on air. Viacom’s chief executive, Sumner Redstone, considers himself a “liberal democrat” and most of the programs shown have a primarily liberal perspective.[11]
Media Conglomerate Impact on Journalism: It leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism. Opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public. The coverage that conglomerates have of issues, especially political, is not necessarily objective, and fails to report both sides of an issue, if not taking a neutral stance.[12] This is known as media bias. Media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists, producers or owners of a media outlet.[11]”

Internet conglomerates[edit]
Although a relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google's parent company[13] belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases Internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several medium-sized online or hybrid online-offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks.[citation needed]
Food conglomerates[edit]
Similar to other industries there are many companies that can be termed as conglomerates.

The Phillip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Phillip Morris International, and Kraft Foods had annual combined turnover of $80 bn.

A conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group, usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries. Often, a conglomerate is a multi-industry company. Conglomerates are often large and multinational.
Conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear/bull market, which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts, sometimes at temporarily deflated values. Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought,[1] ITT Corporation,[1] Litton Industries,[1] Textron,[1] Teledyne.[1] Because of low interest on the loans, the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow. Also, the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market, or capital market, than the smaller firm at their community bank.[citation needed]
For many years this was enough to make the company's stock price rise, as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment. The aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors, who saw a "powerful" and seemingly unstoppable force in business, buy their stock. High stock prices allowed them to raise more loans, based on the value of their stock, and thereby buy even more companies. This led to a chain reaction, which allowed them to grow very rapidly.
However, all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation, conglomerate profits fell. Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased, whereas the rationale for buying a company was that "synergies" would provide efficiency. By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most had been reduced to shells.[2] The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the "typical" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate.
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses.

A conglomerate is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group, usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries. Often, a conglomerate is a multi-industry company. Conglomerates are often large and multinational.
Conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bear/bull market, which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts, sometimes at temporarily deflated values. Famous examples from the 1960s include Ling-Temco-Vought,[1] ITT Corporation,[1] Litton Industries,[1] Textron,[1] Teledyne.[1] Because of low interest on the loans, the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow. Also, the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market, or capital market, than the smaller firm at their community bank.[citation needed]
For many years this was enough to make the company's stock price rise, as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment. The aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors, who saw a "powerful" and seemingly unstoppable force in business, buy their stock. High stock prices allowed them to raise more loans, based on the value of their stock, and thereby buy even more companies. This led to a chain reaction, which allowed them to grow very rapidly.
However, all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation, conglomerate profits fell. Investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased, whereas the rationale for buying a company was that "synergies" would provide efficiency. By the late 1960s they were shunned by the market, and a major sell-off of their shares ensued. To keep the companies going, many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased, and by the mid-1970s most had been reduced to shells.[2] The conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a company's core competency.
In other cases, conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment. Companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks. Flush with cash during the 1980s, General Electric also moved into financing and financial services, which in 2005 accounted for about 45% of the company's net earnings. GE formerly owned a minority interest in NBCUniversal, which owns the NBC television network and several other cable networks. In some ways GE is the opposite of the "typical" 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged, and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage. It was often less expensive to lease from GE than buy new equipment using loans. United Technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate.
With the spread of mutual funds (especially index funds since 1976), investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate. Another example of a successful conglomerate is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses.

International[edit]
The end of the First World War caused a brief economic crisis in Weimar Germany, permitting entrepreneurs to buy businesses at rock-bottom prices. The most successful, Hugo Stinnes, established the most powerful private economic conglomerate in 1920s Europe – Stinnes Enterprises – which embraced sectors as diverse as manufacturing, mining, shipbuilding, hotels, newspapers, and other enterprises.
The best known British conglomerate was Hanson plc. It followed a rather different timescale than the U.S. examples mentioned above, as it was founded in 1964 and ceased to be a conglomerate when it split itself into four separate listed companies between 1995 and 1997.
In Hong Kong, two most well-known conglomerates are the Swire Group and Jardine Matheson, both are British-owned companies that have a history of over 100 years and have business interests that span across four continents with a focus in Asia. Swire Group (or Swire Pacific) controls a wide range of businesses, including property (Swire Properties), aviation (i.e. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair), beverages (bottler of Coca-Cola), shipping and trading. Jardine Matheson operates businesses in the fields of property (Hongkong Land), finance (Jardine Lloyd Thompson), trading, retail (Dairy Farm) and hotels (i.e. Mandarin Oriental).
In Japan, a different model of conglomerate, the keiretsu, evolved. Whereas the Western model of conglomerate consists of a single corporation with multiple subsidiaries controlled by that corporation, the companies in a keiretsu are linked by interlocking shareholdings and a central role of a bank. Mitsubishi is one of Japan's best known keiretsu, reaching from automobile manufacturing to the production of electronics such as televisions.
In China, many of the country's conglomerates are state-owned enterprises, but there is a substantial number of private conglomerates. Notable conglomerates include Legend Holdings, Dalian Wanda Group, China Poly Group, Beijing Enterprises, and Fosun International. Fosun is currently China's largest civilian-run conglomerate by revenue.[3]
In South Korea, the chaebol are a type of conglomerate owned and operated by a family. A chaebol is also inheritable, as most of current presidents of chaebols succeeded their fathers or grandfathers. Some of the largest and most well-known Korean chaebols are Samsung, LG, Hyundai Kia and SK.
The era of Licence Raj (1947–1990) in India created some of Asia's largest conglomerates, such as the Tata Group, Kirloskar Group, Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Sahara India, ITC Limited, Essar Group, Reliance ADA Group, Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla Group and the Bharti Enterprises.
In Brazil most important conglomerates is J&F Investimentos, Odebrecht, Itaúsa, Camargo Corrêa, Votorantim Group, Andrade Gutierrez, Queiroz Galvão
In New Zealand, Fletcher Challenge was formed in 1981 from the merger of Fletcher Holdings, Challenge Corporation, and Tasman Pulp & Paper, in an attempt to create a New Zealand-based multi-national company. At the time, the newly merged company dealt in construction, building supplies, pulp and paper mills, forestry, and oil & gas. Following a series of bungled investments, the company demerged in the early 2000s to concentrate on building and construction.
Advantages and disadvantages of Conglomerates[edit]





This section contains a pro and con list, which is sometimes inappropriate. Please help improve it by integrating both sides into a more neutral presentation, or remove this template if you feel that such a list is appropriate for this article. (March 2017)


Advantages[edit]

Diversification results in a reduction of investment risk. A downturn suffered by one subsidiary, for instance, can be counterbalanced by stability, or even expansion, in another division. For example, if Berkshire Hathaway's construction materials business has a good year, the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business. This advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways. Financial Conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups. There are very important opportunities that can be exploited, to increase shareholder value.
A conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough. Through the internal market, different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively.
A conglomerate can show earnings growth, by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own. In fact, Teledyne, GE, and Berkshire Hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time.[4]

Disadvantages[edit]

The extra layers of management increase costs.[5]
Accounting disclosure is less useful information, many numbers are disclosed grouped, rather than separately for each business. The complexity of a conglomerate's accounts make them harder for managers, investors and regulators to analyze, and makes it easier for management to hide things.
Conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks. The whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts.
Culture clashes can destroy value.[6][7]
Inertia prevents development of innovation.[8]
Lack of focus, and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well.[9]
Brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.

Some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock (a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount) as evidential of these disadvantages, while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency, which undervalues the true strength of these stocks.[10]
Media conglomerates[edit]
Further information: Media conglomerate and Concentration of media ownership
In her 1999 book No Logo, Naomi Klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them:

Time Warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s, including Internet access, content, film, cable systems and television. Their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for cross-promotion and economies of scale. However, the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including Warner Music Group, Warner Books, AOL, Time Warner Cable, and Time Inc. – since 2004.
Clear Channel Communications, a public company, at one point owned a variety of TV and radio stations and billboard operations, together with a large number of concert venues across the U.S. and a diverse portfolio of assets in the UK and other countries around the world. The concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units. For example, the promise of playlisting (allegedly, sometimes, coupled with the threat of blacklisting) on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division. These policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic, but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy. On December 21, 2005, Clear Channel completed the divestiture of Live Nation, and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms, some which Clear Channel holds a small interest in. Live Nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by Clear Channel Communications.
Quebecor Media, a Canadian company controlling a subset of TV and radio stations, print magazines and newspaper, software company and a 4-play telecom company
Impact of Conglomerates on the Media: The six major media conglomerates in the United States are The Walt Disney Company, General Electric, News Corporation, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS. The Walt Disney Company is linked with ABC Television group, creating the largest media corporation, with revenue equal roughly thirty six billion dollars. Since Walt Disney owns ABC, it directly controls what shows and news is shown. General Electric owns NBC, and does not allow any negative reporting against General Electric on air. Viacom’s chief executive, Sumner Redstone, considers himself a “liberal democrat” and most of the programs shown have a primarily liberal perspective.[11]
Media Conglomerate Impact on Journalism: It leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism. Opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public. The coverage that conglomerates have of issues, especially political, is not necessarily objective, and fails to report both sides of an issue, if not taking a neutral stance.[12] This is known as media bias. Media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists, producers or owners of a media outlet.[11]”

Internet conglomerates[edit]
Although a relatively new development, Internet conglomerates, such as Alphabet, Google's parent company[13] belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries, such as brand management. In most cases Internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several medium-sized online or hybrid online-offline projects. In many cases, newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment, access to business contacts, and better rates on loans from various banks.[citation needed]
Food conglomerates[edit]
Similar to other industries there are many companies that can be termed as conglomerates.

The Phillip Morris group, which once was the parent company of Altria group, Phillip Morris International, and Kraft Foods had annual combined turnover of $80 bn.

COFFEY, Circuit Judge.


1
Plaintiff-appellant, McGraw-Edison Company ("McGraw-Edison"), brought this action against the defendants-appellees, Walt Disney Productions ("Disney") and Bally Manufacturing Corporation ("Bally"), alleging that the defendants' use of the plaintiff's TRON trademark violates sections 32 and 43 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1114(1)1 and 1125(a),2 the Illinois Anti-Dilution Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 140, Sec. 22,3 the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121 1/2, Secs. 311-317,4 and the common law of the State of Illinois.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Disney and Bally, and McGraw-Edison appeals.  We reverse.I


2
Since 1900 McGraw-Edison has engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sales of electrical and mechanical products and related services for both consumer and commercial applications.  The Bussmann division of McGraw-Edison manufacturers, distributes, and sells fuses and fuse accessories, and is the world's largest manufacturer of small and medium dimension fuses.  McGraw-Edison registered its trademark TRON in 1958 (for electrical fuses) and 1968 (for fuse holders, clip clamps and fuse clips) and has used the trademark TRON to identify a line of fuses and fuse accessories, placing the TRON mark on both the product and its packaging.  The defendants do not dispute that McGraw-Edison's registrations for the trademark TRON are in full force and effect and are the only registrations for the mark TRON on the U.S. Trademark Register.


3
Between 1970 and 1983, McGraw-Edison sold more than $85 million worth of TRON fuse products and spent more than $1.5 million in advertising TRON products.  TRON fuse products are sold in a variety of outlets, including drug stores, grocery stores, discount stores (e.g., Target, K-Mart, Venture, Woolco-Woolworths), hardware stores (e.g., Ace Hardware, True Value Hardware), and electrical supply and catalog houses (e.g., Advent, Newark).  TRON products are advertised in magazines, trade directories, catalogs and through point of sale materials.

Walt Disney Productions is in the entertainment industry, notably the production of motion pictures, television programs and the operation of amusement parks.  In June 1980, Disney purchased a screenplay entitled TRON, and developed a motion picture with the same name.5   In early 1981 Disney began to develop a merchandising program "to attract prospective manufacturers to produce and sell merchandise associated with the 'TRON' motion picture."    At the same time that Disney was developing the merchandise licensing program, it engaged TCR Service, Inc. to conduct a trademark search in order that Disney might determine whether the use of the name TRON would conflict with third party uses of similar names on like goods.  Disney discovered that the Mego Toy Company ("Mego") owned a federal trademark registration for the mark TRONS for futuristic toys, dolls, and toy robots, as well as federal registrations for variations of the term TRON--such as BIOTRON, MICROTRON, ALPHATRON, and BETATRON,--also for use on futuristic toys, dolls, and robots.  Disney negotiated with Mego and acquired Mego's registrations and rights in the mark TRONS and the variations of TRON (BIOTRON, MICROTRON, etc.) owned by Mego.  Disney's trademark search also disclosed McGraw-Edison's registration for the trademark TRON covering electric fuses and accessories, but Disney's senior legal counsel did not consider McGraw-Edison's registrations as a bar to Disney's use of the mark TRON.


5
As a result of its licensing and merchandising program, Disney entered licensing agreements with manufacturers for a wide variety of products displaying the TRON mark for sale throughout the country.  Specifically, Disney licensed the mark TRON to the defendant Bally for video games and software and to other manufacturers for items such as telephones, phonograph records, wristwatches, tee shirts and sweatshirts, posters, paperback books, nightgowns, pajamas and robes, masquerade costumes, caps, sheets, pillow cases, comforters, bed spreads, curtains, coordinated active wear, warm-up suits, infant and toddler knit shirts and sleepwear, jewelry, buttons and pins, sleeping bags, wallets and bags, beach towels, board games, sun glasses, books, toy figures, View Master slides, puzzles, soaps, thermal mugs and tumblers.  From the inception of its merchandising program in 1981 through April 2, 1983, the TRON products licensed by Disney generated $58 million in sales, with more that $52 million of that total attributable to electronic products, such as computer video games and software.


6
In June 1982, prior to the scheduled July release of the motion picture TRON, McGraw-Edison contacted Disney and Bally (licensed by Disney to manufacture a video game entitled "TRON") and asserted its rights in its registered trademark TRON.  After negotiations failed to resolve the dispute between McGraw-Edison and Disney and Bally, Disney brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York;  on the same day, McGraw-Edison filed its complaint in the present action against Disney and Bally.6   Count I of McGraw-Edison's complaint alleged that Disney's and Bally's use of the TRON mark is likely to cause confusion, or mistake, or to deceive consumers as to the origin and sponsorship of the products of McGraw-Edison, Disney and Bally in violation of the Lanham Act.  15 U.S.C. Sec. 1114(1), Sec. 1125(a).  Count II claimed that the defendants' use of McGraw-Edison's TRON trademark constituted unfair competition, caused injury to McGraw-Edison's business reputation and good will and diluted the distinctive character and quality of McGraw-Edison's TRON mark in violation of Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 140, Sec. 22, ch. 121 1/2, Secs. 311-17, and Illinois common law.  McGraw-Edison sought to enjoin Disney and Bally from further use of the TRON mark, requested an accounting of all profits the defendants derived from their use of the mark TRON, and prayed for compensatory as well as punitive damages.


7
The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts demonstrated "that the continued respective uses by the parties of the name 'TRON' cannot result in confusion.  Nor is it likely that [the] defendant's continued use of the name 'TRON' will diminish the value of plaintiff's trademark used in connection with the sale and promotion of its fuse products."    The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both counts of the complaint, and rejected McGraw-Edison's claim that the existence of material issues of fact precluded summary judgment stating, "those issues [presented by McGraw-Edison] are either not material or are legally based."


8
In determining whether the defendants had created a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of its products, as required to prove a violation of 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1114, 1125, the district court considered the seven factors delineated by this court in Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Church & Dwight Co., Inc., 560 F.2d 1325 (7th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1070, 98 S. Ct. 1252, 55 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1978):  (1) similarity of the marks;  (2) similarity of the product;  (3) area and manner of concurrent advertising and use;  (4) degree of care likely to be exercised by consumer;  (5) strength of plaintiff's mark;  (6) actual confusion;  and (7) intent of the infringer to palm off its products as those of another.  Id. at 1330.  The district court concluded:


9
"In light of the lack of evidence of actual confusion on the part of consumers, the lack of concurrence of markets and advertising, the difference in printing of the two marks, and the lack of intent on the part of defendants to pawn off their products as plaintiff's the court finds that no likelihood of confusion exists."


10
With respect to McGraw-Edison's state law claims in Count II, the court noted that the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121 1/2, Sec. 312, imposes liability upon an infringer only if a likelihood of confusion exists.  The court concluded that the defendants were not liable under the statute, referring to its previous conclusion that no likelihood of confusion existed.  The district court also granted summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's claim under the Illinois Anti-Dilution Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 140, Sec. 22, on the basis of its finding that McGraw-Edison's mark TRON was not distinctive.  On appeal, McGraw-Edison claims that there are genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary judgment on the issue of likelihood of confusion, and that the district court committed errors of law in dismissing its dilution claim.

In reviewing the district court's grant of summary judgment, "we note that judgment is appropriate when 'there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.' "    Black v. Henry Pratt Co., 778 F.2d 1278, 1281 (7th Cir., 1985) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c));  see also Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 82 S. Ct. 486, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962).  "The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact."    Big O Tire Dealers, Inc. v. Big O Warehouse, 741 F.2d 160, 163 (7th Cir.1984).  Thus, "in determining whether factual issues exist, a reviewing court must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party."    Black, at 1278 (quoting Collins v. American Optometric Association, 693 F.2d 636, 639 (7th Cir.1982));  see also Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970).  "Where the moving party fails to meet its strict burden of proof, summary judgment cannot be entered...."  Big O, 741 F.2d at 163.  "[E]ven though there may be no dispute about the basic facts, still summary judgment will be inappropriate, if the parties disagree on the inferences which may reasonably be drawn from those undisputed facts."    Central National Life Insurance v. F & D Co. of Maryland, 626 F.2d 537, 539 (7th Cir.1980).  "[T]he responsibility of the district judge on a motion for summary judgment is merely to determine whether there are issues to be tried, rather than to try the issues himself via affidavits."    American International Group, Inc. v. London American International Corporation Ltd., 664 F.2d 348, 351 (2d Cir.1981) (quoting Jaroslawicz v. Seedman, 528 F.2d 727, 731 (2d Cir.1975)).  We must also bear in mind in this trademark action that "[o]ne who adopts a mark similar to another already established in the marketplace does so at his peril....  All doubts must be resolved against him."    Beer Nuts, Inc. v. Clover Club Foods, Co., 711 F.2d 934, 941 (10th Cir.1983).

A. Count I

12
McGraw-Edison has asserted claims against Disney and Bally under sections 32 and 43 of the Lanham Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 1114, 1125;  both sections require that a plaintiff demonstrate that the defendant has created a likelihood of confusion as to the origin of his product.    See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., 746 F.2d 112, 115 (2d Cir.1984) (Sec. 1125);  Helene Curtis, 560 F.2d 1325, 1330 (Sec. 1114);  Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., 531 F.2d 366, 381 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 830, 97 S. Ct. 91, 50 L. Ed. 2d 94 (1976) (Sec. 1114).  "Whether or not there is a likelihood of confusion is a question of fact as to the probable or actual actions and reactions of prospective purchasers of the goods or services of the parties.  A variety of factors may be material in assessing the likelihood of confusion."    American International Group, 664 F.2d at 351.    See also Henri's Food Products Co., Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 717 F.2d 352, 354 (7th Cir.1983);  James Burrough Ltd. v. Sign of the Beefeater, Inc., 540 F.2d 266, 273 (7th Cir.1976).  In determining likelihood of confusion, this circuit has considered several factors to be important:


13
"the degree of similarity between the marks in appearance and suggestion;  the similarity of the products for which the name is used;  the area and manner of concurrent use;  the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers;  the strength of the complainant's mark;  actual confusion;  and an intent on the part of the alleged infringer to palm off his products as those of another."


14
Helene Curtis, 560 F.2d at 1330 (quoting Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, 433 F.2d 686, 705 (2d Cir.1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 905, 91 S. Ct. 2205, 29 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1971));  see also Piper Aircraft Corp. v. Wag-Aero, Inc., 741 F.2d 925, 934 (7th Cir.1984).  "None of these factors by itself is dispositive of the likelihood of confusion question, and different factors will weigh more heavily from case to case depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved."    Marathon Mfg. Co. v. Enerlite Products Corp., 767 F.2d 214, 218 (5th Cir.1985).  In fact, this court has reversed lower court decisions that have placed excessive importance on certain factors.    Piper Aircraft, 741 F.2d at 934.  McGraw-Edison contends that a factual dispute existed for each of these factors except one (the strength of plaintiff's mark, which McGraw-Edison maintains the district court nevertheless resolved in defendants' favor on the basis of improper and inadmissible evidence), and that the district court improperly resolved factual disputes in defendants' favor on all of the remaining issues except the similarity of the marks.  We will consider each of the factors enumerated in Helene Curtis in turn.


15
1. The Degree of Similarity Between the Marks


16
The district court acknowledged differences between the plaintiff's and defendants' presentation of the mark TRON:


17
"The word TRON as presented by plaintiff, is spelled in straight block letters in one color.  In addition, wherever the word TRON appears in plaintiff's packaging or product, the term Buss or Bussmann also appears, indicating production by plaintiff's Bussmann division.  Sometimes the mark BUSS is as prominent as the mark TRON....


18
The mark TRON, as presented by defendants, is spelled with somewhat unique futuristic-type lettering, with darker colors usually above lighter colors in the letters....  In some of the packaging or advertisements for products tied into the movie, the word 'tron' is spelled in block letters, as plaintiff contends.  ...    In each case, however, the corresponding product itself has the uniquely patterned letters....  In addition, in each instance where the word 'tron' appears, Walt Disney's name also appears, though in very tiny letters."


19
Despite these differences in presentation, the court concluded that "there is a high degree of similarity between the marks and, though their presentation is different, the possibility of confusion exists based upon the marks alone."    Nevertheless, the district court cited "the difference in printing of the two marks" in support of its ultimate conclusion that there was no likelihood of confusion between the plaintiff's and the defendants' products.  McGraw-Edison contends that some of the Disney licensed products fail to include any mention of Disney and that some of the products do not incorporate the described color scheme.  McGraw-Edison further claims that Disney considers the use of TRON in block letters to be within the scope of its (Disney's) rights.  In view of these contentions (the failure to include Disney's name on all Disney licensed TRON products and the failure to employ the described color scheme on all of Disney's TRON items), McGraw-Edison argues that the district court improperly distinguished the parties' marks on the basis of Disney's futuristic lettering style and the inclusion of Walt Disney's name on any Disney TRON product.  Were we to accept McGraw-Edison's view of the facts regarding Disney's use of the TRON mark (failing to place Disney's name on all Disney licensed TRON products or incorporate the Disney color scheme on all Disney TRON merchandise), the fact remains that the marks are distinguishable since wherever the word TRON appears on McGraw-Edison's packaging or products, the term Buss or Bussmann also appears (Disney licensed products obviously do not include the term Buss or Bussmann).  The marks thus are not identical, and the district court could properly conclude that "there is a high degree of similarity between the marks," yet consider the differences between the marks in determining whether a likelihood of confusion existed between McGraw-Edison's and defendants' products.

2. The Similarity of the Products

20
According to the district court, "The product lines carrying Disney's TRON label and plaintiff's TRON label are very different....  Plaintiff's TRON line ... includes high quality, utilitarian electrical products.  The products carrying Disney's TRON label are entertainment-based.  Video games, pajamas, toy watches, T-shirts and costumes have little to do with high quality fuses."    The court concluded that the McGraw-Edison and Disney product lines are "entirely unrelated."    McGraw-Edison contends the district court failed to recognize the wide scope of Disney's licensing program and emphasis on electrical and electronic products and overlooked the fact that McGraw-Edison fuses are compatible and consistent with the type of products licensed by Disney.  The defendants argue, without providing any statutory or case law support, "the only material issue in determining similarity of the products is whether any of the goods actually licensed by Disney are in any way related to fuses."


21
The fact that the products at issue may be "very different" is not dispositive of the issue of the similarity of the products in determining the existence of a likelihood of confusion between products.  The question is "whether the products are the kind the public attributes to a single source."    E. Remy Martin & Co., S.A. v. Shaw-Ross International Imports, Inc., 756 F.2d 1525, 1530 (11th Cir.1985).  "[T]he rights of an owner of a registered trademark ... extend to any goods related in the minds of consumers in the sense that a single producer is likely to put out both goods."    Id.;  see also Sign of the Beefeater, 540 F.2d at 274.  In finding the parties' product lines to be "entirely unrelated," the district court apparently ignored the question of whether the purchasing public might believe a single source could produce both electronic fuses (manufactured by McGraw-Edison) and video games and telephones (licensed by Disney);  ignoring this question seems especially significant in this case since McGraw-Edison introduced evidence that 35% of persons shown photographs of both McGraw-Edison and Disney TRON products believed the products were manufactured by the same company.  (McGraw-Edison's survey is discussed infra. )    Further, the district court's opinion failed to address the fact that the defendant Bally has been a customer of McGraw-Edison and uses McGraw-Edison fuses in at least some of its video arcade games--a fact which conceivably could lead a consumer to believe that TRON fuses and TRON video games are in some manner attributable to a single source.  Accordingly, we hold that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding "whether the products are the kind the public attributes to a single source," and the district court erred in finding the product lines of the parties to be "entirely unrelated."

3. The Area and Manner of Concurrent Use

22
The district court found "the TRON products licensed by Disney are generally sold to those who have seen or are interested in the movie ... [while] plaintiff's products are generally sold to industrial users (30% to 40%) and electronic experts (40% to 50%)."    The court further stated:


23
"Of the 10 to 20 percent purchased by the public, the fuses are sold in electrical stores or electrical departments of general stores.  Only 10 per cent of plaintiff's advertising is directed to the lay consumer.  Though some stores may carry both plaintiff's goods and Disney's licensed goods, the intersection is small.  ...    Generally, public purchasers of plaintiff's goods will purchase them in electrical outlet stores where goods licensed by defendant Disney with the TRON mark will usually not be available."


24
Our review of the record has failed to disclose any evidence supporting the court's initial finding that Disney's TRON products "are generally sold to those who have seen or are interested in the movie ...."  Further, the district court found that "only 10 percent of plaintiff's advertising is directed to the lay consumer," while the record reveals that in addition to the approximately ten percent of the TRON advertising funds expended directly in the residential consumer market, McGraw-Edison provided an undisclosed amount of advertising materials to its distributors who in turn advertised to residential customers.  Thus the total amount of advertising directed to residential consumers cannot be established on the basis of the record before the court.  Finally, the record reflects that Disney does not limit the type of retail outlets where its licensed products are sold, (except to exclude outlets that are incompatible with the Disney image such as barrooms or poolrooms or dance halls) but rather Disney allows its products to be sold in hardware stores, through mail order and catalog sales, and in department stores such as K-Mart, Sears, Montgomery Ward, and Woolco-Woolworths.  The record also discloses that McGraw-Edison TRON fuses are sold in drug stores, grocery stores, hardware stores and department stores such as Target, K-Mart, Venture and Woolco-Woolworths.  But we have been unable to discover any evidence in the record documenting the percentage of TRON fuses sold to the general public through hardware or department stores as opposed to electronic specialty stores, nor have we found evidence in the record demonstrating the percentage of Disney licensed TRON products sold in hardware and department stores as opposed to mail order or catalog outlets, or other retail outlets where McGraw-Edison TRON products are not available.  Thus, on the record we are unable to find support for the district court's conclusion that McGraw-Edison and Disney TRON products are not sold in similar outlets.  Since the defendants have failed to provide evidence establishing who purchases Disney TRON products, the extent of McGraw-Edison TRON advertising directed to residential consumers, and the number of stores carrying both Disney TRON products and McGraw-Edison TRON fuses, we hold that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving the lack of a genuine issue of material fact concerning the area and manner of concurrent use of the plaintiff's and defendants' products.


25
4. The Degree of Care Likely to Be Exercised by Consumers


26
The district court compared the types of products manufactured by McGraw-Edison and licensed by Disney and concluded, "Generally, consumers buying fuses would take more care than those buying the products licensed by Disney."    As our review of the record has failed to reveal evidence supporting this conclusion of the district court, we hold that the defendants have failed to establish the lack of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers.

5. The Strength of McGraw-Edison's Mark

27
It is undisputed that McGraw-Edison's registration of TRON is the only registration for that trademark.  The court noted, however, the existence of numerous registrations for trademarks similar to TRON, for example, TRONS, CELTRON, Z-TRON, U V TRON, FILTRON, TRINITRON, ACUTRON, TICKETRON, and VOLTRON.  The court also noted that McGraw-Edison's trademark TRON is always accompanied by Buss or Bussmann, and that the majority of TRON advertising has been geared toward a narrow, sophisticated audience through trade journals.  According to the court, "These factors indicate that TRON is a relatively weak mark outside its narrow area of high quality fuse products."


28
In assessing the strength of the McGraw-Edison TRON mark, we initially must determine which category of trademarks the word TRON belongs to:


29
"Trademarks may be placed into four categories according to strength and the corresponding amount of protection which will be accorded them.  Trademarks can be (1) descriptive or generic, i.e., the mark describes the product or service itself;  (2) suggestive, i.e., the mark describes or suggests a characteristic of the product or service;  (3) arbitrary, i.e., the mark is a word in common use, but applied to a product or service unrelated to its meaning, so that the word neither describes nor suggests the product or service;  and (4) coined, i.e., the mark is a word devised or invented for the purpose of identifying the product."


30
Tisch Hotels, Inc. v. Americana Inn, Inc., 350 F.2d 609, 611 n. 2 (7th Cir.1965);  see also Sun Banks of Florida, Inc. v. Sun Federal Savings & Loan, 651 F.2d 311, 315 (5th Cir.1981).  One commentator has referred to coined marks as "fanciful":  " 'Fanciful' marks consist of 'coined' words which have been invented for the sole purpose of functioning as a trademark.  Such marks comprise words which are either totally unknown in the language or are completely out of use at the time, as with obsolete or scientific terms."    McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, Sec. 11:3, 436 (2nd Ed.1984).  We believe that the district court properly characterized the mark TRON as "somewhat fanciful" as the presentation of evidence in the record fails to disclose the origin of the TRON mark or whether TRON has any meaning as a word,7 cf. J.B. Williams Co., Inc. v. Le Conte Cosmetics, Inc., 523 F.2d 187, 192 (9th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 913, 96 S. Ct. 1110, 47 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1976) ("Conti" considered to be a strong mark because the origin of the name was unknown and there was no evidence that it was a word with meaning of its own), but we are unable to ascertain from the record whether the district court considered the fanciful nature of the TRON mark in finding TRON to be "a relatively weak mark outside its narrow area of high quality fuse products."


31
Furthermore, the third party registrations of trademarks similar to TRON discussed by the district court are material in determining the strength of the TRON mark only to the extent that the similar marks are promoted by their owners or recognized by the consuming public.  "A trademark which is found only in the records of the Patent and Trademark Office does not materially affect the distinctiveness of another's mark which is actively used in trade."    Callmann, Unfair Comp., Trademarks & Monopolies Sec. 20.44, 270 (4th Ed.1983).


32
"The significance of third-party trademarks depends wholly upon their usage.  Defendant introduced no evidence that these trademarks were actually used by third parties, that they were well promoted or that they were recognized by consumers.  As the Court pointed out in Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. v. Lilli Ann Corp., 376 F.2d 324, 325 (1967), 'the existence of these registrations is not evidence of what happens in the marketplace or that customers are familiar with their use.' "


33
Scarves by Vera, Inc. v. Todo Imports Ltd., Inc., 544 F.2d 1167, 1173 (2d Cir.1976);  see also Stanadyne, Inc. v. Lins, 490 F.2d 1396, 1397 (CCPA 1974);  Smith Bros. Mfg. Co. v. Stone Mfg. Co., 476 F.2d 1004, 1005 (CCPA 1973).  Also, since the record before us fails to contain any evidence that these "similar trademarks" are actually used by third parties or that they have been promoted and are recognized by consumers, we conclude the defendants have failed to prove the absence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the strength of the TRON mark.

6. Actual Confusion

34
Our review of the record reveals that the defendants have failed to provide any evidence to show that there was no likelihood of confusion between its TRON products and McGraw-Edison TRON products. McGraw-Edison commissioned Elrich and Lavidge, Inc., a marketing research firm, to conduct a marketing research study to determine whether there existed a likelihood of confusion between the plaintiff's and the defendants' TRON products.  The survey consisted of 494 personal interviews conducted in five cities.  The people interviewed were shown a photograph of McGraw-Edison's TRON electric fuses along with a photograph of one of Disney's licensed products bearing the TRON name.  When asked whether the products were put out by the same company or a different company, 175 out of 494 people interviewed (35%) replied that it was the same company.8   McGraw-Edison submitted the survey to the court as evidence of actual confusion between McGraw-Edison's and Disney's products bearing the TRON mark.  The district court discounted this survey, stating that it had:


35
"problems similar to a survey discussed in Henri's Food Products Co., Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 717 F.2d 352, 356-57 (7th Cir.1983).  In Henri's, the questions tended to bring to the interviewee's mind the products which contained the allegedly infringed mark.  The interviewee was then asked who made the infringing product.  The court held that the previous questions had potentially contaminated the latter question."


36
The plaintiff in Henri's commissioned two separate and distinct surveys to be conducted, neither of which employed the same methodology as the survey in the present case:  while the survey in the case at bar presented photos of both Disney's and McGraw-Edison's TRON products to the interviewees and asked whether the goods were "put out by the same or different companies", both surveys discussed in Henri's presented the interviewee with a single product and asked either "Who do you believe makes this product?" or "Who puts out this product?"    In one of the Henri's surveys, the question of "Who puts out this product?" was preceded by five other questions that potentially contaminated the responses to the final question concerning the origin of the product.  The district court's comparison and application of that survey to the survey in this case is both inappropriate and misapplied as they used a completely different methodology in comparison with the present survey.  We thus disagree with the district court that the survey introduced by McGraw-Edison suffered from the same problems as the survey in Henri's.    Furthermore, the Henri's court acknowledged that the defendant pointed to several flaws in one of the surveys "which caution against giving it too much weight," but the court also stated, "we cannot conclude, however, that the survey should be ignored."    Henri's, 717 F.2d at 357.  We see no logical or legally sound reason nor has the district court given any persuasive reasoning or explanation of why the survey results are not probative as to confusion among the consuming public.  Although the district court suggested that a flaw of the survey was its presentation of both Disney and McGraw-Edison products to a single interviewee instead of giving each interviewee either a McGraw-Edison product or a Disney product and inquiring who put out the product, we believe the district court's concern regarding the manner of presentation to the interviewee goes to the weight to be accorded to the survey results rather than providing a reason to ignore the survey evidence altogether.  We thus conclude the district court improperly disregarded the results of McGraw-Edison's survey showing that 35% of those interviewed believed the McGraw-Edison and Disney products shown to them were put out by the same company.


37
"[R]eason tells us that ... very little proof of actual confusion would be necessary to prove likelihood of confusion."    World Carpets, Inc. v. Dick Littrell's New World Carpets, 438 F.2d 482, 489 (5th Cir.1971).  Indeed, while likelihood of confusion "can be proven without any evidence of actual confusion, such evidence if available, is entitled to substantial weight."    Helene Curtis, 560 F.2d at 1330.  Since the defendants have failed to offer any evidence to demonstrate that there is no likelihood of confusion and, on the other hand, the plaintiff has offered its survey results revealing that 35% of those individuals interviewed were confused as to whether the McGraw-Edison and Disney TRON products shown to them were manufactured by the same company, we conclude the defendants have not established the lack of a material question of fact regarding actual confusion.


38
7. The Intent on the Part of the Alleged Infringer


39
The district court noted that Disney and Bally were aware of McGraw-Edison's TRON trademark when they licensed products bearing that mark, but found no evidence that Disney intended to confuse consumers:  "In fact, the evidence clearly shows that Disney believed it was not infringing upon plaintiff's mark.  Intent, therefore does not come into play in the court's calculations."    McGraw-Edison argues to the contrary that Disney disregarded McGraw-Edison's rights, since its efforts in licensing and marketing TRON products "increased the likelihood that a consumer would be confused into believing there was a common sponsorship or authorization between the parties or their products, and increased the dilution of plaintiff's mark."    The record reveals that Disney knew of McGraw-Edison's registration of the mark TRON and McGraw-Edison's use of that mark, went to their own retained counsel to support their theory that McGraw-Edison's registrations of the TRON mark did not bar Disney's use of TRON, and proceeded with licensing and merchandising its own line of TRON products without even contacting McGraw-Edison.  "Subjective issues such as good faith are singularly inappropriate for determination on summary judgment."    American International Group, Inc. v. London American International Corporation Ltd., 664 F.2d 348, 353 (2d Cir.1981);  see also Central National Life Insurance v. F & D Co. of Maryland, 626 F.2d 537, 540 n. 6 (7th Cir.1980) ("Where intent is a controlling element, courts must be especially cautious in granting summary judgment, since the resolution of that issue depends so much on the credibility of the witnesses ....").  In view of the fact that Disney proceeded to license TRON products despite its awareness of McGraw-Edison's registered TRON trademark, we conclude that the district court improperly resolved the issue of the defendants' intent against McGraw-Edison on the motion for summary judgment.


40
Since we are convinced that the defendants have failed to meet their strict burden of proof in establishing the lack of genuine issues of material fact with respect to:  1) whether the products bearing the McGraw-Edison TRON mark and the products bearing the Disney TRON mark are the kind the public attributes to a single source;  2) the area and manner of concurrent use of the products;  3) the degree of care likely to be exercised by consumers purchasing McGraw-Edison's and Disney's TRON products;  4) the strength of McGraw-Edison's TRON mark;  5) the extent of actual confusion among consumers;  and 6) the intent of Disney, we hold that the district court erred in concluding as a matter of law that no likelihood of confusion exists and in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Count I.

B. Count II

41
In Count II, McGraw-Edison asserted claims under Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121 1/2, Sec. 312, and the Anti-Dilution Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 140, Sec. 22.9   Under the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act a defendant is liable only if the plaintiff can establish a likelihood of confusion between the parties' products.    Hooker v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 551 F. Supp. 1060, 1064 (N.D.Ill.1982).  " 'Likelihood of confusion' has the same meaning in unfair competition cases under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act as it has in traditional infringement cases."    Id.  As we have found that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the likelihood of confusion between defendants' and plaintiff's products bearing the TRON mark, we conclude that the granting of summary judgment was unwarranted and improper on McGraw-Edison's claim under the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act.


42
Under the Anti-Dilution Act, the relevant factors to be considered by the court are "the distinctiveness of the mark and whether the mark is being diluted."    Hyatt Corporation v. Hyatt Legal Services, 736 F.2d 1153, 1157 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S. Ct. 434, 83 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1984).  The district court reiterated its finding that McGraw-Edison's mark TRON was "a weak mark," noting that many products have names similar to or incorporating the TRON name and that the TRON name is almost always used in connection with Bussmann or Buss.  Further the court noted that the word TRON "is not extraordinarily unique, taken as it is from the word 'electronic.' "    Finding the plaintiff's mark not to be distinctive, the court failed to analyze whether the defendants' use of the TRON mark diluted the strength of McGraw-Edison's mark.  McGraw-Edison argues to the contrary that its mark TRON is distinctive, emphasizing:  1) that its mark TRON has been registered since 1958 and is the only trademark registration with that name;  2) that it has spent over $1.5 million in advertising TRON products since 1970;  3) that the district court found the word TRON to be "somewhat fanciful and create[ ] images of high level electronics";  4) that it has sold over $85 million of TRON products since 1970;  and 5) that its Bussmann division which markets TRON products, "is the world's largest manufacturer of small and medium dimension fuses."    In Hyatt, we stated that the factors to be considered in determining the distinctiveness of a mark include the type of mark (a mark that is "coined" or invented may make distinctiveness easier to show), the length of time of the mark has been used, the scope of advertising and promotions, the nature and extent of the business and the scope of the first user's reputation.  736 F.2d at 1158.  We have already concluded above that the defendants have failed to prove the absence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to the strength of McGraw-Edison's TRON mark (specifically regarding the use of "similar" trademarks registered by third parties) and the scope of McGraw-Edison's advertising and promotion of TRON products to residential consumers.  Accordingly, we hold that the existence of these factual issues precludes the court from finding that McGraw-Edison's TRON mark is not distinctive as a matter of law, and we hold that it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment on the state law claims asserted in Count II of McGraw-Edison's complaint.


43
In reversing the district court's grant of summary judgment, we express no view as to the merits of McGraw-Edison's claims.  Rather, we only conclude that on the present record, the district court should not have decided the disputed issues in the case on a motion for summary judgment.

III

44
The judgment of the district court is REVERSED.

 The Honorable Robert A. Grant, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, is sitting by designation


1
 Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act provides:
"Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant--
(a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive;  or
(b) reproduce, counterfeit, copy, or colorably imitate a registered mark and apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or advertisements intended to be used in commerce upon or in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.
shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided...."
15 U.S.C. Sec. 1114(1).


2
 Section 43 of the Lanham Act provides:
(a) Any person who shall affix, apply or annex, or use in connection with any goods or services, or any container or containers of goods, a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce, ... shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation."
15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).


3
 The Illinois Anti-Dilution Act provides in pertinent part:
"Every person ... adopting and using a mark [or] trade name, ... may proceed by suit, and the circuit courts shall grant injunctions, to enjoin subsequent use by another of the same or any similar mark [or] trade name ... if there exists a likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark [or] trade name of the prior user notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services."
Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 140, Sec. 22.


4
 The Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act defines as deceptive conduct which:
"(2) causes likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the source, sponsorship, approval or certification of goods or services;
(3) causes likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the affiliation, connection, or association with or certification by another;"
Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121 1/2, Sec. 312.


5
 According to Disney:
"The plot of the movie involved a real world in which people are controlled by an evil conglomerate using a master computer program, and an electronic world inside the computer program.  The hero of the film is transported into the computer program where he wages a battle against evil in a setting filled with sights and sounds typical of a video game.  The characters in the electronic world are counterparts to characters in the real world.  Among these characters is a video warrior named 'TRON.' "


6
 Disney subsequently dismissed its declaratory judgment action against McGraw-Edison in the United States District Court in New York


7
 Although the district court concluded that the word "tron" is taken from the word electronic, we have found no evidence in the record to support this hypothesis or speculation which might actually be accurate, but a look into Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged) discloses that tron is a suffix denoting a vacuum tube or denoting a device for the manipulation of subatomic particles


8
 One-half of those interviewed were asked, "Are these two products put out by the same company or by different companies?";  and one-half were asked the question in the reverse order, "Are these two products put out by different companies or by the same company?"


9
 McGraw-Edison also claimed that the defendants had engaged in unfair competition in violation of Illinois common law.  We need not address this claim separately as the Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 121 1/2, Sec. 311 et seq. is merely a codification of the Illinois common law of unfair competition.    McDonald's Corp. v. Gunville, 441 F. Supp. 71 (N.D.Ill.1977), aff'd, 622 F.2d 592 (7th Cir.1980)
