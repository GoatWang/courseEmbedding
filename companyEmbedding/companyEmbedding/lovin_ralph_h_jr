     	F1
     

Represents restricted stock awards under the Third Amended and Restated 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  The awards are subject to certain vesting, forfeiture, and termination provisions.


     	F2
     

The number of shares beneficially owned following the reported transaction is equal to the reporting person's July 14, 2017, account balance in the employer stock fund under the issuer's 401(k) plan, divided by the closing price on July 14, 2017. The plan is unitized and as such does not itself allocate a specific number of shares to each participant.


     	F3
     

The shares are held as custodian for minor grandchildren. The reporting person disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting person is the beneficial owner of such securities for purposes of Section 16 or for any other purpose.
