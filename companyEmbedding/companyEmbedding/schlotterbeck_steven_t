This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

EQT Names President Steven Schlotterbeck To Succeed David Porges As CEO In 2017






Business Wire




Oct 27, 2016 6:15 AM EDT













 




























































  EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT), today, announced that Steven T. Schlotterbeck, EQT's current President, will succeed David L. Porges as Chief Executive Officer when Porges retires from that position in the first quarter of 2017, following the filing of the Company's 10-K. Porges will remain as Chairman of EQT's Board of Directors for one year following his retirement as CEO.  A similar leadership transition will also occur for EQT Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:EQM) and EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE:EQGP), where Porges has served as CEO of the two companies. Upon Porges' retirement, Schlotterbeck will become CEO of both EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings.  "The EQT Board of Directors and I have established a seamless succession plan, which has gone very smoothly thanks in large part to the way in which Steve has steadily embraced increasing levels of responsibility at EQT," said Porges. "The past several years have been transformational for EQT, and Steve has been integral in positioning the Company for continued success. He has emerged as a highly valued and respected leader across the Company, which has made this transition and its timing possible. I'm confident the companies will be in good hands for many years to come."  In December 2015, Schlotterbeck was named President of EQT Corporation, while also serving as President, Exploration and Production. Before that, he was appointed Executive Vice President of EQT in 2013. He became Senior Vice President of EQT; and President, Exploration and Production in 2010. Schlotterbeck has been a member of the Board for EQT GP Holdings since its formation in 2015.  Schlotterbeck joined EQT in 2000, holding various engineering and management positions until 2008, when he was promoted to the positions of Vice President of EQT; and President, Production.  "It is an honor to be chosen to succeed Dave Porges as the CEO of EQT Corporation," said Schlotterbeck. "Dave has led our Company through times of tremendous opportunity and his financial prudence has positioned EQT to endure one of the industry's most challenging periods of cyclical uncertainty. Dave's insight and vision have enabled EQT to emerge from this period even stronger and more prepared to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.

"Schlotterbeck will assume responsibilities for several of the Company’s corporate functions, including human resources; environment, health and safety; and external affairs. He will also retain his existing responsibilities for EQT’s Production business unit, as well as other shared services functions, including information technology, procurement, and facilities," EQT said in a statement.




He joined EQT in 2008 and became a vice president and president of production in 2008, and senior vice president in 2010 and executive vice president in 2013. He was also named to the 2015 Pittsburgh Business Times Who's Who in Energy list.
