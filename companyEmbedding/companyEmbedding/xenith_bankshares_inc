Union Bankshares Corporation Announces Agreement to Acquire Xenith Bankshares, Inc.




















May 22, 2017 08:00 ET

 | Source: Union Bankshares Corporation






RICHMOND, Va., May  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Union Bankshares Corporation (NASDAQ:UBSH) or (“Union”) and Xenith Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:XBKS) or (“Xenith”) jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Union to acquire Xenith in an all-stock transaction.  Combining the two organizations will create the preeminent community banking franchise in Virginia and expand Union’s retail footprint into North Carolina and Maryland.  Based on financial data as of March 31, 2017, the combined company would have total assets of $11.9 billion, total deposits of $9.2 billion and gross loans of $8.9 billion.  This transaction strengthens Union’s presence in Virginia’s second most populous market, Hampton Roads / Virginia Beach, and adds to its Richmond and Northern Virginia footprints.  After systems integration, on a pro forma basis, Union will have the fourth largest branch network in Virginia and will remain the only community bank with a statewide footprint across the Commonwealth. “We are excited about the opportunity to bring our companies together to enhance our product and customer service capabilities,” said Raymond D. Smoot, Jr., Chairman of Union Bankshares Corporation’s Board of Directors.  “We believe that our two companies are stronger together and the combination gives Union a unique franchise to create long term shareholder value.” “We expect that our combined statewide footprint will bring additional convenience to our customers and position us as a strong competitor against large regional institutions and smaller community banks alike – making us the preeminent community bank in Virginia,” said John C. Asbury, President and Chief Executive Officer of Union.  “The combination with Xenith delivers on our stated priorities for this year as well as our acquisition goals enabling Union to efficiently cross the $10 billion asset threshold.  Xenith brings extensive commercial and industrial lending expertise as they were built as a C&I platform focusing on Richmond and Northern Virginia and subsequently added an extensive branch network through the combination with the Bank of Hampton Roads. Deepening our presence in Hampton Roads and adding to our Richmond and Northern Virginia network were priorities for Union and we’re also able to gain retail entry points in North Carolina and Maryland.  With a more diverse loan portfolio, lower loan to deposit ratio and efficiencies gained, I believe the combined franchise will be able to generate sustainable top-tier financial performance for our shareholders.” “This transaction delivers on Xenith’s original vision to be an integral part of creating the preeminent commercial bank headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said T. Gaylon Layfield, III, Chief Executive Officer for Xenith. “With a statewide presence, strong pro forma capital ratios, enhanced retail delivery system and focused commercial banking capabilities, the combined company will be positioned to deliver value to our customers.  Both banks are committed to attracting the best talent available and building a culture that encourages and enables that talent to better serve our customers and to be effective in setting the combined company apart from the competition.  I look forward to working with our new teammates to deliver on this exciting vision.” Following the closing of the merger Asbury will continue as President and CEO of the combined organization, and Layfield will serve for a transitional period as Executive Vice Chairman of Union Bank & Trust working to ensure a successful integration and enhancing the commercial banking strategy.  Following the closing of the merger, the Union Board of Directors will expand to 20 members, and will be composed of 18 members from the current Union Board and two members from the Xenith Board.  Smoot will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of combined company.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of Xenith common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.9354 shares of Union common stock.  This implies a deal value per share of $29.67 per share of Xenith common stock or approximately $701.2 million in the aggregate based on Union’s closing stock price of $31.72 on May 19, 2017.  Shareholders owning more than 4.9% of Xenith common stock will, after the closing of the merger, be subject to a restriction on the sale of their Union shares for 60 days. In consideration of the merger, extensive due diligence was performed by both companies over a six-week period.  The merger agreement has been approved by the board of directors of each company.  The companies expect to complete the transaction in early January 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc. is acting as the financial advisor to Union and Troutman Sanders LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. is acting as financial advisor to Xenith and Hunton & Williams LLP is acting as its legal advisor in the transaction.

Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations, or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact, are based on certain assumptions as of the time they are made, and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “view,” “opportunity,” “potential,” or words of similar meaning or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of Union or Xenith or their management about future events. Such statements include statements as to the anticipated benefits of the merger, including future financial and operating results, cost savings and enhanced revenues as well as other statements regarding the merger. Although each of Union and Xenith believes that its expectations with respect to forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance, or achievements of Union or Xenith will not differ materially from any projected future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) the businesses of Union and Xenith may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (2) expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; (3) revenues following the merger may be lower than expected; (4) customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; (5) the ability to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals, and the ability to complete the merger on the expected timeframe may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (6) changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, tax rates, legislative/regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; the quality and composition of the loan and securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the companies’ respective market areas; their implementation of new technologies; their ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines, and (7) other risk factors detailed from time to time in filings made by Union or Xenith with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Union and Xenith undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Contacts:
