401(k) Rollovers | James T. Borello & Co.

401(k) Rollovers


When you retire or leave your job, one of the decisions you have to make is what to do with your 401(k) assets. There are several options available to you, and it’s wise to consult an experienced financial consultant to determine which option is best for your current needs and long-term financial goals. Fees are always an important factor in this decision. At James T. Borello & Co., our consultants have many years of experience dealing with retirement accounts and helping clients with their retirement planning needs.
Rollover IRAs
One of the most popular options for handling a 401(k) is to rollover assets into an IRA account. With this option, your 401(k) funds are transferred as a lump sum to either a Roth IRA account or a traditional IRA account. Which type of IRA account is right for you depends on your circumstances and your income level eligibility. With a Roth IRA, you will have to pay income taxes on the transferred amount at the time of the rollover. However, you will not have to pay further taxes on growth or withdrawals.
If you rollover your 401(k) to a traditional IRA, you will only have to pay taxes at the time of withdrawal provided you meet certain requirements. Those requirements include:

Depositing 100% of your rollover funds into the IRA
Depositing 401(k) funds into your IRA within 60 days of receiving them or choosing a direct rollover.

If these requirements are not met, you will have to pay income taxes on the funds you receive. If you are less than 59½ years of age, you will have to pay an additional 10% penalty for early withdrawal.
Contact us to learn more about your 401(k) options and how a rollover IRA might work in your financial plan.

Gregg hails from the Beverly neighborhood on Chicago’s Southwest Side. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from Arizona State University. Additionally, he earned his Master’s degrees in Computer Science and an MBA, both from the University of Chicago. Gregg focused on tax strategies as a Portfolio Manager in the Private Clients Group at First Chicago Corp. for six years before developing financial models for hedge funds, banks and endowments for the next decade. Before arriving at James T. Borello & Co., Gregg came full circle in investment management joining Morgan Stanley’s Global Wealth Management Group in Chicago.
Gregg’s area of focus is families with special needs children.  Gregg has family members that are on the spectrum and realized years ago that no one individual or firm specialized in tax strategies, financial planning, and estate planning for families dealing with the complexities of special needs.  This is what motivated him to dedicate his efforts to this unique specialization.
Gregg is an Enrolled Agent. This status is the highest credential awarded by the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, this allows him unlimited representation rights before the IRS and is recognized in all 50 states. He routinely represents clients involving audits, appeals, collection action, payment issues, and tax refund matters.
Gregg and his wife, Ingrid, take an active role in the Compass Church of Naperville. Additionally, Gregg is on the Board of Directors and a member of the Finance Committee of Chicago Hope Academy.
Gregg was an avid cyclist in college and still enjoys cycling with fellow enthusiasts in Naperville, where he lives with his wife, son and daughter.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
