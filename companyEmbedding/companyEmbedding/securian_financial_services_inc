							Community commitment
						










								Doing good works
							
Securian has a strong-rooted tradition of taking an active role in our community through philanthropy and volunteerism. Community is one of Securian’s six core values – and we work hard to be a good neighbor.
Making meaningful contributions
Throughout our 137-year history, Securian has made giving a priority. In the past 10 years, we’ve given more than $25 million in cash gifts to our community. When including in-kind gifts and corporate volunteerism, Securian’s giving totals nearly $37 million since 2007.
In 2016 alone, Securian contributed nearly $3.4 million in cash gifts and more than $1.8 million in in-kind gifts and volunteer services.
We estimate 90 percent of our associates participate in our annual Greater Twin Cities United Way campaign, which raised $1 million in 2016, $691,000 of which came directly from associates. This level of giving ranks us as one of the top corporate contributors in the Twin Cities for the ninth consecutive year – a significant achievement relative to our size.









								The Securian Foundation
							
We established the Securian Foundation in 1988 to further our charitable giving efforts. The foundation works to enhance the quality of life and vitality of our community by investing in nonprofit organizations that make a positive difference and advance the common good.















					Success stories
				

					The Securian Foundation works with many nonprofit organizations in the Twin Cities to accomplish specific goals and advance the overall quality of life in our community.
				
See how we help












					Funding priorities
				

					The Securian Foundation focuses our contributions in four main areas: economic independence, education, human services and special community needs, and the arts.
				
Read our priorities












					Applying for funding
				

					Learn more about how to apply for grant funding from the Securian Foundation.
				
Review our process













					Mentoring the future
				
Securian associates have been mentoring young people in the community for more than 30 years.We have six ongoing programs designed to help students flourish personally, academically and socially.
See mentoring in action











					MN Cup Startup Competition
				
Securian is proud to join other local organizations in supporting MN Cup, a competition among Minnesota's emerging entrepreneurs.The call for entries is open and Securian is offering a special $10,000 award for innovation!
Read about MN Cup














Rolling up our sleeves
Giving back is a priority for Securian’s associates – our associates tallied more than 12,000 total volunteer hours in 2016, including 154 volunteer days to Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity and more than 3,100 hours mentoring area students.
More than 110 associates devote their time and talent serving on the boards of directors of nonprofit organizations and 32 associates contributed more than 50 hours volunteering with nonprofits in 2016.
Securian associates also contributed:

478 pints of blood through American Red Cross blood drives
Nearly 3,700 pounds of food to local food shelves
