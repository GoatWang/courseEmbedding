– USA, CO – Aytu BioScience, Inc. (OTCQX: AYTU), a specialty healthcare company focused on commercializing treatments for urological and related conditions, today announced that Josh Disbrow, Aytu’s Chief Executive Officer, and Jarrett Disbrow, Aytu’s Chief Operating Officer, have been added to the Aytu Board of Directors. The two will join Michael Macaluso, who remains on the Board as the company’s sole independent director.
Josh Disbrow, Aytu’s Chief Executive Officer, stated “The initial expansion of our Board of Directors is in line with other moves Aytu has made to accelerate our growth and establish a leadership position as a specialty healthcare company focused on urology. We have built a strong commercial foundation, bringing in two commercial stage products and rapidly building a sales and marketing team to propel their growth. Further, we are advancing toward global commercialization of MiOXSYS™, which is now CE Marked and under clinical development in the United States. With the initial board members now in place, we expect to further develop our leadership team with additional directors that will help ensure that our assets will be maximized. In conjunction with our appointments, we have begun the process of recruiting independent board directors to augment our team. We look forward to providing updates as we appoint additional board members in the near future.”
Josh Disbrow and Jarrett Disbrow were the founding management team at Arbor Pharmaceuticals and served as Vice President of Commercial Operations and President/CEO, respectively until the company’s acquisition in 2010. Since exiting Arbor and prior to the formation of Aytu BioScience in April 2015, Josh Disbrow served as COO of Ampio Pharmaceuticals and CEO of Ampio subsidiary Luoxis, a specialty biotechnology company. Prior to that he held commercial roles at LipoScience, Cyberonics, and GlaxoSmithKline. Most recently Jarrett Disbrow held the position of CEO of Vyrix Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on male sexual dysfunction, as well as prior commercial roles at Accentia Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline.
