	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.
 
Learn About Umbrella

Re:          See Exhibit A
 
Dear Ms. Skeens:
 
Presented below please find specific responses to each of your comments and questions of November 30, 2012, as well as your final comment of December 20, 2012:
 
General Comments
 
1.                          COMMENT: How many people are eligible for the offer?
 
RESPONSE:  There are currently 46,048 contracts eligible for the offer.
 
2.                          COMMENT: What will the average amount of the enhanced surrender value be?
 
RESPONSE:  The average amount of the Enhanced Surrender Value will be $112,135. That is $11,988 greater than the average amount of the cash surrender value provided under the contract without the enhancement.
 
3.                          COMMENT: Approximately how many people and what percentage of eligible contract owners would actually receive an enhanced surrender value?
 
RESPONSE:  Assuming every contract owner eligible accepted the offer:
 
·      Nearly 100% of eligible contract owners would receive an enhanced surrender value through the program.
 




 
·      24% will benefit from both enhanced account value and waiver of surrender charges and fees;
 
·      24% will benefit from enhanced account value and waiver of fees;
 
·      32% will benefit from waiver of surrender charge and fees; and
 
·  20% will benefit from waiver of fees.
 
4.                          COMMENT: Is any compensation paid to financial intermediaries?  If so, how much?
 
RESPONSE:  No.  There is no compensation paid to financial intermediaries for this program.
 
5.                          COMMENT: Provide a copy of the written notice that will be sent to contract owners and any other documents or cover letters that will be sent.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. We have attached the current drafts of the written notices and marketing materials that, when finalized, will be sent to contract owners when the program is available. Please note that prior to launching the program and sending the attached materials to contract owners, we will file such materials as appropriate with the Securities Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The attached notices are in draft form.
 
6.                          COMMENT: How long will the offer be open for?
 
RESPONSE:  Currently we do not have a date when this offer will terminate. We added a defined term “Offer Termination Date” in the supplement as the date we determine that the offer will terminate in the future.  All eligible contract owners will receive prior written notice of this date.
 
Specific Comments
 
7.                          COMMENT:  The name of the program “Enhanced” Surrender Value is misleading as the value may not actually be enhanced.   Please rename the program.
 
RESPONSE:  Registrant respectfully submits that nearly 100% of eligible contract owners who choose to accept the offer will receive an enhancement.  As noted above, everyone who accepts the offer will no longer have the fees associated to the rider or underlying contract. A percentage of those eligible will no longer have the fees and will benefit from waiver of remaining surrender charges.  Further, a percentage will benefit from the enhanced account value as well as the waiver of surrender charges and fees. Accordingly, Registrant respectfully declines to rename the program as each contract owner will receive some type of enhancement above contract level surrender value.
 
8                             COMMENT: Use either “full surrender request” or ‘liquidation request” but don’t use both.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant updated the supplement to only use the term “full surrender request.”
 
2




 
9.                          COMMENT:  Add a definition of “in good order.”
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant defined In Good Order in the supplement.
 
10.                   COMMENT: If there is no compensation paid to agents consider stating this in the supplement.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed.  Registrant added disclosure in the supplement that no compensation is paid to financial intermediaries.
 
11.                   COMMENT:  In the 2nd paragraph, please clarify that accepting the offer will result in termination of the contract and any benefits.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant clarified that the contract, riders and benefits terminate and made the disclosure prominent in bold typeset.
 
12.                   COMMENT:  In the 3rd paragraph, please clarify that if you do not accept the offer that your contract and riders will continue unchanged.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant added disclosure that if the offer is not accepted, the contract owner does not need to take any action and the contract and riders benefits will continue.
 
13.                   COMMENT: Bold the sentence that states you are not required to accept this offer.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed.  Registrant has bolded the sentence that states contract owners are not required to accept this offer.
 
14.                   COMMENT:  Please provide a description in the supplement of the acknowledgement form and the surrender form in the supplement and bold the sentence that states if we don’t receive the acknowledgement form and just receive the liquidation form we will process the surrender but you won’t get the enhanced value.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. A description of the forms has been added to the supplement with bolded disclosure that both forms must be received in order for the contract owner to receive the enhanced surrender value.
 
15.                   COMMENT: In the formula calculation in (b) — state whether any applicable fees will be deducted.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Disclosure was added to the formula (b) that any applicable fees upon Surrender will be waived.
 
16.                   COMMENT: Please clarify at what point the Payment Base will not be increased (e.g., supplement date?).
 
3




 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Disclosure was added that the Payment Base will be locked in as of supplement effective date.
 
17.                   COMMENT: In the discussion of if you plan on using the proceeds to purchase a new annuity and there will be a new surrender, please change “will” to “may.”
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed.  Registrant has changed the wording from “will” to “may.”
 
18.                   COMMENT: In the examples, please add an example where the contact owner does not benefit and get an enhanced surrender value.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant added as Example 4, an illustration where there is no additional Surrender value amount, however fees are waived.
 
19.                   COMMENT: Please add a description of the Life Income Benefit II rider.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Registrant added disclosure describing the Lifetime Income Benefit II rider as a guaranteed benefit rider designed to help protect your investment from poor market performance through potential annual automatic Payment Base increases, provide longevity protection through Lifetime Benefit Payments, and ensure a Death Benefit equivalent to the greater of Premium Payments reduced for partial Surrenders or Contract Value.
 
20.                   COMMENT: Why do some filings include the prospectus and others don’t?
 
RESPONSE:  Registrant is bringing previously Great Wested products out of Great West.  We confirm that we have not made any other material changes.
 
21.                   COMMENT:  If the Enhanced Surrender Value program is eligible on any contracts that have a bonus feature describe how the bonus feature works with the program (will the bonus be recaptured?).
 
RESPONSE:  Certain “bonus” or Plus contracts are eligible for the program. If the offer is accepted, we will not recapture any bonuses or payment enhancements. We added disclosure that Premium Enhancements will not be recaptured.
 
22.                   COMMENT: If Hartford may make a better offer in the future, consider adding this disclosure.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed. Disclosure was added in the last paragraph of the supplement that after the Offer Termination Date, we may offer different and/or more favorable programs to other contract owners.
 
23.                   COMMENT: Include a copy of the rider in the registration statement.
 
4




 
RESPONSE:  Agreed.  The rider is incorporated as an exhibit to the Part C of each registration statement.
 
24.                   COMMENT: Please update the Powers of Attorney to include Lisa Proch.
 
RESPONSE:  Agreed.  The Powers of Attorney have been updated and incorporated into Part C of each registration statement.
 
25.                   COMMENT:  Please consider adding the amount of the surrender value the customer would get in the letter that we will be sent to customers or a phone number where they could obtain it.
 
Response:  Since the actual amount of the surrender value fluctuates due to market performance we are not going to include the surrender value in the letter because we feel it will provide confusion.  The letter does include a phone number for our Annuity Customer Service area and customers can obtain the amount of the current surrender value from the customer service representatives.
 
26.                   Tandy Representation
 
Registrant hereby acknowledges that the Staff of the Commission has not passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus and related statement of additional information for the above referenced registration statements. Registrant further acknowledges that the review of the filing by the Staff of the Commission does not relieve it of its full responsibility for the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosure of this filing nor does it foreclose the Commission from taking any action with respect to the filing. Further, registrant acknowledges that it may not assert as a defense in any proceeding initiated by the Commission or any person under federal securities law that the Staff of the Commission reviewed the filing and provided comments to the registrant or that the filing became automatically effective thereafter.
 
Thank you for your review. Please let us know if you have any questions.

DRAFT
 
Enhance Your Variable Annuity Options
 
The Hartford’s Enhanced Surrender Value Offer
 
You’re eligible for an offer that may enhance the surrender value of your variable annuity with The Hartford.
 
When you purchased a variable annuity with The Hartford, you most likely did so to meet your needs for the future, including retirement.
 
The Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit you purchased as part of your variable annuity is designed to provide a stream of guaranteed lifetime income that will not decrease due to negative market performance and has the potential to increase based on increases in the Contract Value due to positive market performance.
 
Your needs may have changed since you purchased your annuity with The Hartford. For example, you may have an unexpected need for liquidity that your variable annuity doesn’t provide or you would like access to your Contract Value.
 
This brochure is designed to help provide information as you consider this offer. You should discuss this offer carefully with your financial advisor to determine whether it’s right for you.
 
Who does this offer apply to?
 
This offer applies to Director M and Leaders 3 variable annuities (generally offered between August 2006 and October 2008) with the Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit rider.  For full eligibility rules, please refer to your prospectus supplement.
 
Being eligible does not always equate to this offer having an increased surrender value for you. This offer is entirely voluntary and you should discuss the offer with your financial advisor to determine if it’s appropriate for you.
 
What are my options?
 
1.              Participate in the Enhanced Surrender Value offer. If you do so, you’ll surrender your contract and either receive an amount greater than your current Contract Value or avoid incurring certain charges associated with a full surrender of your contract.
 
2.              Determine that you don’t want to participate in this offer. If you choose not to participate, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll continue to service your contract and are committed to honoring our obligations to you.
 
You should discuss your options with your financial advisor. This offer may not be available in all states.
 




 
Why is The Hartford making me this offer?
 
As part of the company’s long-term strategy, we are currently taking steps to reduce the risks associated with our annuity business. We also realize that for some contract holders, taking advantage of this offer may help meet current financial needs that differ from the ones you identified when you purchased your variable annuity.
 
What do I receive if I participate in this program?
 
You’ll receive the greater of:
 
·                  Your Contract Value OR
 
·                  Your Contract Value plus 20% of your Payment Base, not to exceed a cap of 90% of your Payment Base.
 
For the purposes of this offer, your Payment Base is locked in as of your offer date noted in the enclosed letter, and no automatic Payment Base increases will apply. The cap will be adjusted for any Partial Surrenders taken between the offer date and the Valuation Day the Enhanced Surrender Value is calculated. Your Contract Value will continue to fluctuate based on market performance.
 
If you decide not to accept this offer, your contract will retain the Lifetime Income Builder II benefit riders (including Payment Base increases, if applicable), and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits.
 
What benefits do I give up if I participate in this offer?
 
The decision to accept this offer is irrevocable and you must surrender your annuity contract.  This means that you’ll no longer be able to receive Lifetime Benefit Payments as guaranteed by your Lifetime Income Builder II rider.  Also, any death benefit guarantee ceases upon the surrender of your annuity contract.
 
How do I participate in this offer?
 
If you decide you want to accept this offer, you must complete the enclosed acknowledgement form along with a full surrender request or request to send the proceeds to another provider. While this offer is in effect, any request for a full surrender of your contract received in good order but without a completed acknowledgement form will not receive the benefit of this offer. Again, we recommend that you discuss your options and the specifics of your situation in detail with your financial advisor.
 
Is there a deadline?
 
The Hartford reserves the right to end the offer at any time; however a deadline has not been set. Prior to the offer expiring we’ll notify you in writing.
 
What should I consider as I make my decision?
 
If you participate in this offer, you will fully surrender your Director M or Leaders 3 variable annuity, as well as your Lifetime Income Builder II rider benefits, and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits. This means you’ll no longer receive Lifetime Benefit Payments and Death Benefit protection provided under the Lifetime Income Builder II rider. Your contract will be terminated and the benefits cannot be reinstated after accepting this offer.
 
This offer may not be right for everyone and you have full discretion regarding whether to accept this offer or not. We’ll continue to honor all of our financial obligations to our contract holders and are here to support you as you consult with your financial advisor to determine what the right decision is for you.
 




 
Additional details are available in the prospectus and prospectus supplement you recently received. If you have additional questions about this program, please contact your financial advisor or our Annuity Contact Center at 1-800-501-8126 Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., or Friday 9:15 a.m. to 6 p.m., Eastern time, you may also visit our website at www.hartfordinvestor.com
 
EXAMPLES:
 
Upon a full surrender, the Offer provides the greater of:
 
(1) the Contract Value (CV) plus 20% of the Payment Base (PB), capped at 90% of Payment Base
(2) the Contract Value, applicable charges will be waived
 
Example #1 — Offer is the contract value plus 20% of the PB
Contract Value = $60,000
Payment Base = $100,000
90% of Payment Base = $90,000
(CV) $60,000 + (20% x (PB) $100,000) = $80,000
Offer = $80,000
 
Example #2 — Offer is capped at 90% of the PB
Contract Value = $80,000
Payment Base = $110,000
90% of Payment Base = $99,000
(CV) $80,000 + (20% x (PB) $110,000) = $102,000
Offer = $99,000
 
Example #2 — Offer is contract value, applicable charges waived
Contract Value = $120,000
Payment Base = $125,000
90% of Payment Base = 112,500
The Contract Value is already above the ESV cap of 90% of the PB
Offer = $120,000

We have included in this package a listing of your clients who are receiving an Offer letter.  Also enclosed are copies of the Amendatory Rider, Acknowledgement Form and Enhanced Surrender Value brochure each Contract Owner will receive.  It is important that each Contract Owner reviews this Offer with a financial advisor to determine if it is right for them.  If a Contract Owner chooses to accept the Offer, a completed acknowledgement form must be included in order to receive the benefit of this Offer,
 
Please know that this offer is entirely voluntary.  If a Contract Owner chooses to not accept the offer, their Contract will retain the LIB II rider benefits (including Payment Base increases if applicable), and any benefits provided under other riders they may own including death benefits.  Once this Offer is elected, it is irrevocable and the Contract cannot be reinstated.
 
We understand that different Contract Owners have different needs, and those needs can change over the life of an annuity Contract.  We understand this Offer may not be appropriate for all eligible Contract Owners, and encourage discussion with a financial advisor to determine if it is right for them.

(1) These expenses are annualized. The Fund began operations on June 17, 1999.

(2) The Fund's Class 2 distribution plan or "Rule 12b-1 Plan" is described in
the Fund's prospectus. While the maximum amount payable under the Fund's
Class 2 Rule 12b-1 Plan is 0.35% per year of the Fund's average daily net
assets, the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance
Products Trust has set the current rate at 0.25% per year through at least
April 30, 2001.

(3) The fund administration fee is paid indirectly through the management fee.

(4) On 2/8/00, a merger and reorganization was approved that combined the
Franklin Small Cap Fund with a similar fund of the Templeton Variable
Products Series Fund, effective 5/1/00. On 2/8/00, fund shareholders
approved new management fees, which apply to the combined fund effective
5/1/00. The table shows restated total expenses based on the new fees and
assets of the fund as of 12/31/99, and not the assets of the combined fund.
However, if the table reflected both the new fees and the combined assets,
the fund's expenses after 5/1/00 would be estimated as: Management Fees
0.55%, Distribution and Service Fees 0.25%, Other Expenses 0.27%, and Total
Fund Operating Expenses 1.07%.





(5) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 0.75% of average net assets for
the current fiscal year. After December 31, 2001, the manager and
administrator may end this arrangement at any time. Without this reduction
Total Fund Operating Expenses were:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(6) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 1.30% of average net assets,
including Class 2's 12b-1 plan fee, for the current fiscal year. After
December 31, 2001, the manager and administrator may end this arrangement at
any time.


(7) Each Series has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the series'
custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the series with
its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each series may enter into
other such arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would
also have the effect of reducing the series' expenses. After these
reductions, the Total Fund Operating Expenses would be:

(8) MFS has contractually agreed, subject to reimbursement, to bear expenses for
these series such that each such series' "Other Expenses" (after taking into
account the expense offset arrangement described above), do not exceed 0.15%
of the average daily net assets of the series during the current fiscal
year. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least
May 1, 2001, unless changed with the consent of the board of trustees which
oversees the series. Without this waiver, "Total Fund Operating Expenses"

Item 26. Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or
Registrant



Filed herewith as Exhibit 16.



Item 27. Number of Contract Owners




As of July 31, 2000, there were 10,733 Contract Owners.




Item 28. Indemnification



Sections 33-770 to 33-778, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes ("CGS") provide that a corporation may provide indemnification
of or advance expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent.
Reference is hereby made to Section 33-771(e) of CGS regarding
indemnification of directors and Section 33-776(d) of CGS regarding
indemnification of officers, employees and agents of Connecticut
corporations. These statutes provide, in general, that Connecticut
corporations incorporated prior to January 1, 1997 shall, except to the
extent that their certificate of incorporation expressly provides
otherwise, indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents
against "liability" (defined as the obligation to pay a judgment,
settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with
respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses incurred
with respect to a proceeding) when (1) a determination is made pursuant
to Section 33-775 that the party seeking indemnification has met the
standard of conduct set forth in Section 33-771 or (2) a court has
determined that indemnification is appropriate pursuant to Section
33-774. Under Section 33-775, the determination of and the
authorization for indemnification are made (a) by the disinterested
directors, as defined in Section 33-770(3); (b) by special counsel; (c)
by the shareholders; or (d) in the case of indemnification of an
officer, agent or employee of the corporation, by the general counsel
of the corporation or such other officer(s) as the board of directors
may specify. Also, Section 33-772 provides that a corporation shall
indemnify an individual who was wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection
with a proceeding to which he was a party because he was a director of
the corporation. In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation or with respect to conduct for which the director, officer,
agent or employee was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a
financial benefit to which he was not entitled, indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding against the corporation to which the individual was named a
party.


Under the Depositor's bylaws, the Depositor must indemnify both
directors and officers of the Depositor for (1) any claims and
liabilities to which they become subject by reason of being or having
been directors or officers of the Depositor and (2) legal and other
expenses incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to
the extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.





Section 33-777 of CGS specifically authorizes a corporation to procure
indemnification insurance on behalf of an individual who was a
director, officer, employer or agent of the corporation. Consistent
with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor and
Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and officers liability insurance policy issued to The
Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

be kept by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
rules thereunder, are maintained by Hartford at 200 Hopmeadow

Item 31. Management Services

Registration Statement.

(a) The Registrant hereby undertakes to file a post-effective

FUND PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT



THIS AGREEMENT, made as of this ___ day of ____________, 2000 by and
among Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford"); a Connecticut corporation,
on its behalf and on behalf of each separate account set forth on SCHEDULE A
attached as it may be amended from time to time (the "Separate Accounts");
___________________ (the "Fund"); ___________________ (the "Distributor"); and
___________________ (the "Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Fund engages in business as an open-end management
investment company and is available to act as the investment vehicle for
separate accounts established by insurance companies for life insurance policies
and annuity contracts; and


WHEREAS, the Distributor is registered as a broker/dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), is a member in
good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") and serves as principal underwriter of the shares of the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable state securities
laws and serves as the investment adviser to the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Fund intends to make available shares of its series set
forth on SCHEDULE B, as it may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement
of the parties (the "Series"), to the Separate Accounts of Hartford; and


WHEREAS, Hartford is an insurance company which has registered or will
register the variable annuities and/or variable life insurance policies listed
in Schedule A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), unless exempt from such
registration, to be issued by Hartford for distribution (the "Contracts"); and


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, Hartford,
the Fund, the Distributor and the Adviser agree as follows:



ARTICLE I. FUND SHARES



1.1     The Fund and the Distributor agree to make shares of the Series
available for purchase on each Business Day by the Separate Accounts. The Fund
will execute orders placed for each Separate Account on a daily basis at the
net asset value of each Series next computed after receipt by the Fund or its
designee of such order.


3





A.     For purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the designee
of the Fund and Distributor for receipt of orders from each Separate Account
and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that the Fund
receives notice of orders by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the next following
Business Day.


B.     For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the
Fund calculates the net asset value of each Series pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as set forth in the Series'
prospectus.


1.2    The Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"), acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, may refuse to permit the
Fund to sell shares of any Series to any person, or suspend or terminate the
offering of shares of any Series if such action is required by law or by
regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the sale of shares.


1.3    The Fund and the Distributor agree that shares of the Fund or any of its
Series will be sold only to insurance companies for use in conjunction with
variable life insurance policies or variable annuities. No shares of the Fund
or any of its Series will be sold to the general public.


1.4    The Fund and the Distributor agree to redeem for cash, at Hartford's
request, any full or fractional shares of the Series held by the Separate
Accounts, on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt
by the Fund or its designee of the request for redemption.


A.     For the purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the
designee of the Fund for receipt of redemption requests from each Separate
Account and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that
the Distributor receives notice of the redemption request by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern
time) on the next following Business Day.


1.5    Hartford agrees that purchases and redemptions of Series shares offered
by the then current prospectus of the Series shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of the prospectus.


A.     Hartford will place separate orders to purchase or redeem
shares of each Series. Each order shall describe the net amount of shares and
dollar amount of each Series to be purchase or redeemed.


B.     In the event of net purchases, Hartford will pay for shares
before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next Business Day after receipt of an
order to purchase shares.


C.     In the event of net redemptions, the Fund shall pay the
redemption proceeds in federal funds transmitted by wire before 3:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the next Business Day after an order to redeem Fund shares is
made.


4





1.6    Issuance and transfer of the Series' shares will be by book entry only.
Share certificates will not be issued to Hartford or any Separate Account.
Shares purchased will be recorded in an appropriate title for each Separate
Account or the appropriate sub-account of each Separate Account. The Fund shall
furnish to Hartford the CUSIP number assigned to each Series identified in
Schedule B attached as may be amended from time to time.


1.7    The Distributor shall notify Hartford in advance of any dividends or
capital gain distributions payable on the Series' shares, but by no later than
same day notice by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (by wire or telephone, followed by
written confirmation). Hartford elects to reinvest all such dividends and
capital gain distributions in additional shares of that Series. The Fund shall
notify Hartford of the number of shares issued as payment of dividends and
distributions. Hartford reserves the right to revoke this election and to
receive all such dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.


1.8    The Distributor shall make the net asset value per share of each Series
available to Hartford on a daily basis as soon as reasonably practical after
the net asset value per share is calculated. The Fund shall use its best
efforts to make such net asset value per share available by 6:00 p.m. Eastern
time.


A.     If the Distributor provides materially incorrect share net
asset value information through no fault of Hartford, the Separate Accounts
shall be entitled to an adjustment with respect to the Series shares purchased
or redeemed to reflect the correct net asset value per share.


B.     The determination of the materiality of any net asset value
pricing error and its correction shall be based on the SEC's recommended
guidelines regarding these errors. Any material error in the calculation or
reporting of net asset value per share, dividend or capital gain information
shall be reported promptly to Hartford upon discovery. The Fund and/or its
agents shall indemnify and hold harmless Hartford against any amount Hartford
is legally required to pay qualified plans ("Plans") or annuity or life
insurance contract owners that have selected a Series as an investment option
("Contract owners"), and which amount is due to the Fund's or its agents'
material miscalculation and/or incorrect reporting of the daily net asset
value, dividend rate or capital gains distribution rate. Hartford shall submit
an invoice to the Fund or its agents for such losses incurred as a result of
the above which shall be payable within sixty (60) days of receipt. Should a
material miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to Hartford,
Hartford shall immediately reimburse the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents for any material losses incurred by the Fund, the applicable Series or
its agents as a result of the incorrect calculation. Should a material
miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to the Plans or
Contract owners, Hartford will consult with the Fund or its designee as to what
reasonable efforts shall be made to recover the money and repay the Fund, the
applicable Series or its agents. Hartford shall then make such reasonable
effort, at the expense of the Fund or its


5





agents, to recover the money and repay the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents; but Hartford shall not be obligated to take legal action against the
Plans or Contract owners.


With respect to the material errors or omissions described above, this section
shall control over other indemnification provisions in this Agreement.

steps necessary to adequately diversify the Series so as to achieve compliance
within the grace period afforded by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.817-5.



ARTICLE VI. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS

Contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the Series. The Board of
Directors of the Fund shall promptly inform Hartford if it determines that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists and the implications thereof.


9





6.2    Hartford will report any potential or existing material irreconcilable
conflict of which it is aware to the Board of Directors of the Fund. This
includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by Hartford to inform the Board
of Directors of the Fund whenever Contract owner voting instructions are
disregarded.


6.3    If it is determined by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
or a majority of its independent Directors, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists due to issues relating to the Contracts, Hartford will, at its
expense and to the extent reasonably practicable, take whatever steps it can
which are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including, without limitation, withdrawal of the affected Separate
Account's investment in the Series. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a
result of such withdrawal.


6.4    Hartford, at the request of the Adviser will, at least annually, submit
to the Board of Directors of the Fund such reports, materials or data as the
Board may reasonably request so that the Board may fully carry out the
obligations imposed upon them. All reports received by the Board of potential
or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining the
existence of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately
remedies a conflict, shall be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or
other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made
available to the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.

meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"
and individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.1)
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts
paid in settlement with the written consent of Hartford, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including the reasonable costs of
investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)
(collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject
under any statute or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of Series shares or the Contracts
and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in a disclosure
document for the Contracts or in the Contracts themselves or in sales
literature generated or approved by Hartford applicable to the Contracts or
Separate Accounts (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing)
(collectively, "Company Documents" for the purposes of this Article VII), or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the


10





alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, provided that this
indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified Party if such statement or
omission or such alleged statement or omission was made in reliance upon and
was accurately derived from written information furnished to Hartford by or on
behalf of the Fund for use in Company Documents or otherwise for use in
connection with the sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Fund Documents as defined in Section 7.2 (A)(1)) or
wrongful conduct of Hartford or persons under its control, with respect to the
sale or acquisition of the Contracts or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Fund Documents as
defined in Section 7.2(A)(1) or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and accurately derived from written information furnished to the
Fund by or on behalf of Hartford; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by Hartford to
provide the services or furnish the materials required under the terms of this
Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by Hartford in this Agreement or arise out
of or result from any other material breach of this Agreement by Hartford; as
limited by and in accordance with, Sections 7.1(B) and 7.1(C) hereof.


B.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any Losses which are due to an Indemnified Party's
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such
Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless
disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to the Fund or
Distributor, whichever is applicable.


C.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified Party unless
such Indemnified Party shall have notified Hartford in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify Hartford of any
such claim shall not relieve Hartford from any liability which it may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, Hartford shall be entitled to participate, at
its own expense, in the


11





defense of such action. Hartford also shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action. After
notice from Hartford to such party of Hartford's election to assume the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any
additional counsel retained by it, and Hartford will not be liable to such
party under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties will promptly notify Hartford of the
commencement of any litigation or proceedings against them or any of their
officers or directors in connection with the issuance or sale of the Series
shares or the Contracts or the operation of the Fund.

Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties" and
individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.2) against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement with the written consent of the Distributor, the Adviser, and the
Fund, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including
the reasonable costs of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in
connection therewith) (collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified
Parties may become subject under any statute or regulation, or at common law or
otherwise, insofar as such Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of the
Series' shares or the Contracts and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration
statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Fund applicable to the Series
(or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing) (collectively, "Fund
Documents" for purposes of Article this VII) or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, provided that this indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified
Party if such statement or omission of such alleged statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and was accurately derived from written information
furnished to the Fund, the Adviser, or the Distributor by or on behalf of

sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and

under their control, with respect to the sale or distribution of the Contracts
or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Company Documents, or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and accurately derived
from written information furnished to Hartford by or on behalf of the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund to provide the services or furnish the
materials required under the terms of this Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the
Fund in this Agreement or arise out of or result from any other material breach
of this Agreement by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; as limited by,
and in accordance with, Sections 7.2(B) and 7.2(C) hereof.


B.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any Losses which are due
to an Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of such Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such
Indemnified Party's reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this
Agreement or to Hartford or the Separate Account, whichever is applicable.


C.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any claim made against an
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund, as applicable, in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund of any such claim shall not relieve the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund from any liability which they may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund
shall be entitled to participate, at their own expense, in the defense thereof.
The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund also shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.
After notice from the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund to such party of
their election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear
the expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the Distributor, the
Adviser, and the Fund will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred


13





by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Distributor,
the Adviser, and the Fund of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings
against them or any of their officers or directors in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Contracts or the operation of a Separate Account.


7.3    Any party seeking indemnification (the "Potential Indemnitee") will
promptly notify any party from whom they intend to seek indemnification (each a
"Potential Indemnitor") of all demands made and/or actions commenced against
the Potential Indemnitee which may require a Potential Indemnitor to provide
such indemnification. At its option and expense, a Potential Indemnitor may
retain counsel and control any litigation for which it may be responsible to
indemnify a Potential Indemnitee under this Agreement.


7.4    With respect to any claim, the parties each shall give the others
reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records, and
employees and those books, records, and employees within its control pertaining
to such claim, and shall otherwise cooperate with one and other in the defense
of any claim. Regardless of which party defends a particular claim, the
defending party shall give the other parties written notice of any significant
development in the case as soon as practicable, and such other parties, at all
times, shall have the right to intervene in the defense of the case.


7.5    If a party is defending a claim and indemnifying another party hereto,
and: (i) a settlement proposal is made by the claimant, or (ii) the defending
party desires to present a settlement proposal to the claimant, then the
defending party promptly shall notify the Indemnified Party of such settlement
proposal together with its counsel's recommendation. If the defending party
desires to enter into the settlement and the Indemnified Party fails to consent
within five (5) business days (unless such period is extended, in writing, by
mutual agreement of the parties hereto), then the Indemnified Party, from the
time it fails to consent forward, shall defend the claim and shall indemnify
the defending party for all costs associated with the claim which are in excess
of the proposed settlement amount.


Regardless of which party is defending the claim: (i) if a settlement requires
an admission of liability by the non-defending party or would require the
non-defending party to either take action (other than purely ministerial
action) or refrain from taking action (due to an injunction or otherwise) (a
"Specific Performance Settlement"), the defending party may agree to such
settlement only after obtaining the express, written consent of the
non-defending party. If a non-defending party fails to consent to a Specific
Performance Settlement, the consequences described in the last sentence of the
first paragraph of this Section 7.5 shall NOT apply.


14





7.6    The parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute
concerning this indemnification obligation. Should those efforts fail to
resolve the dispute, the ultimate resolution shall be determined in a DE NOVO
proceeding, separate and apart from the underlying matter complained of, before
a court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may initiate such proceedings
with a court of competent jurisdiction at any time following the termination of
the efforts by such parties to resolve the dispute (termination of such efforts
shall be deemed to have occurred thirty (30) days from the commencement of the
same unless such time period is extended by the written agreement of the
parties). The prevailing party in such a proceeding shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.



ARTICLE VIII. APPLICABLE LAW



8.1    This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted
under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut.


8.2    This Agreement, its terms and definitions, shall be subject to the

9.1    This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the first
to occur of:


A.     Termination by any party for any reason upon six-months advance
written notice delivered to the other parties; or


B.     Termination by Hartford by written notice to the Fund, the
Adviser or the Distributor with respect to any Series in the event any of the

state and/or federal law, or such law precludes the use of such shares as the
underlying investment medium of the Contracts issued or to be issued by
Hartford; or,

respect to any Series in the event that such Series ceases to qualify as a
Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code or under any
successor or similar provision; or

15





9.2    Effect of Termination.


A.     Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Fund
shall, at the option of Hartford, continue to make available additional shares
of the Series pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for all
Contracts in effect on the effective date of termination of this Agreement (the
"Existing Contracts") unless such further sale of Series shares is proscribed
by law, regulation or applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without
limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts will be permitted to direct
allocation and reallocation of investments in the Fund, redeem investments in
the Series and invest in the Series through additional purchase payments.


B.     Hartford agrees not to redeem Series shares attributable to the
Contracts except (i) as necessary to implement Contract owner initiated or
approved transactions, or (ii) as required by state and/or federal laws or
regulations or judicial or other legal precedent of general application or

(iii) as permitted by an order of the SEC. Upon request, Hartford will promptly
furnish to the Fund the opinion of counsel for Hartford to the effect that any
redemption pursuant to clause (ii) above is a legally required redemption.


C.     In addition to the foregoing, Article VII Indemnification shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

RE:    HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT SEVEN
FILE NO. 333-76423



Dear Sir/Madam:


I have acted as General Counsel to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company
(the "Company"), a Connecticut insurance company, and Separate Account Seven
(the "Account") in Connecticut with the registration of an indefinite amount of
securities in the form of variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
I have examined such documents (including the Form N-4 registration statement)
and reviewed such questions of law as I considered necessary and appropriate,
and on the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:


1.     The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing as a
stock life insurance company under the laws of the State of Connecticut
and is duly authorized by the Insurance Department of the State of
Connecticut to issue the Contracts.


2.     The Account is a duly authorized and existing separate account
established pursuant to the provisions of Section 38a-433 of the
Connecticut Statutes.


3.     To the extent so provided under the Contracts, that portion of the assets
of the Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising
out of any other business that the Company may conduct.


4.     The Contracts, when issued as contemplated by the Form N-4 Registration
Statement, will constitute legal, validly issued and binding obligations
of the Company.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form N-4
registration statement for the Contracts and the Account.


Sincerely yours,






/s/ Lynda Godkin

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
