Corporate Overview

Enumeral is discovering and developing novel antibody immunotherapies that help the immune system attack diseased cells. Our unique platform allows us to identify and characterize promising new drugs relevant to cancer, infectious and inflammatory diseases, giving us the potential to positively affect millions of patients who are underserved by current therapeutic alternatives.
The core technology behind our platform was developed at and licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Massachusetts General Hospital. Our human-driven immunoprofiling platform enables us to extensively interrogate the human immune microenvironment to identify and validate potential drug candidates.
Our platform enables us to study rare immune cells from human patients at high resolution and measure drug effects in a patient-specific, disease-specific manner. Harnessing The Power of Human™, our platform provides a basis for developing best-in-class product candidates from a fundamental understanding of how immunotherapies work in each patient. Our vision then is to use this human-derived knowledge to better predict which antibody drug candidates are most likely to be effective in a targeted group of patients, with the goals of reducing side effects and accelerating the drug discovery process. Our discoveries will not only be valuable for the development of therapeutic antibodies but also as potential diagnostic products.
Initially, we are building a pipeline of immunomodulators that target checkpoint proteins, which the body use to prevent runaway immune responses that can prove debilitating or even deadly. Our near term goals include preclinical testing for our internal pipeline programs in our human-driven platform, as well as in other preclinical models.
We are leveraging the breadth of our technology through strategic collaborations. To date, we have engaged in several proof-of-concept collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical companies. Through them, our technology has been validated in a commercial setting, and a number of applications have been demonstrated.
In July 2014, we raised $21.5 million through a private placement offering and began public trading on the OTC Markets (OTCQB) with the ticker ENUM.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Enumeral Reports Second Quarter Financial ResultsBack to ENUM Snapshot

Share Story4:30PM ET 8/12/2016 Business WireCAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: ENUM) ("Enumeral" or the 
      "Company"), a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and 
      development of novel antibody-based immunotherapies to help the immune 
      system fight cancer and other diseases, today announced its financial 
      results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
    

Recent Business Highlights


        In July 2016, Enumeral sold 12% Senior Secured Promissory Notes in a 
        private placement offering to certain accredited investors in the 
        aggregate principal amount of $3,038,256, before deducting placement 
        agent fees and expenses equal to approximately $385,337 (the 
        "Offering"). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the 
        Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.
      

        In June 2016, Enumeral entered into a Definitive License and Transfer 
        Agreement with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals 
        GmbH. During the spring of 2016, the Company also received an 
        aggregate of $1,000,000 in upfront and license maintenance fees from 
        Pieris. This agreement continues the royalty-bearing worldwide license 
        granted to Pieris under specified Enumeral patent rights and know-how 
        to research, develop and market fusion proteins that comprise a moiety 
        derived from Enumeral's 388D4 anti-PD-1 antibody linked to one or more 
        Pieris Anticalin® proteins for use in the field of 
        oncology. Enumeral has also granted Pieris an option until May 31, 
        2017 to license specified Enumeral patent rights and know-how covering 
        two additional Enumeral antibody programs on the same terms and 
        conditions as the 388D4 anti-PD-1 antibody.
      

Second Quarter 2016 Financial Results


Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents were 
        $1,133,819 as of June 30, 2016, as compared to $3,596,262 as of 
        December 31, 2015. As of the date of this press release, and giving 
        effect to the net proceeds from the Offering described above, Enumeral 
        believes that it only has sufficient liquidity to fund operations 
        through November 2016. The Company is continuing to explore a range of 
        potential transactions, which may include public or private equity 
        offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements, 
        and/or other strategic alternatives, including a merger, sale of 
        assets or other similar transactions. If Enumeral is unable to raise 
        additional capital on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, Enumeral 
        may be required to downsize or wind down its operations through 
        liquidation, bankruptcy, or a sale of its assets.
      

Collaboration and license revenue. Collaboration and license 
        revenue increased by $1,047,417, or 362%, to $1,336,466 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $289,049 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2015. This increase in revenue is primarily 
        attributable to the Company's license agreement with Pieris.
      

Grant revenue. Grant revenue increased by $70,242, or 76%, to 
        $162,506 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 
        $92,264 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is 
        attributable to the Company's Phase II Small Business Innovation 
        Research agreement with the National Cancer Institute.
      

Research and development expenses. Research and development 
        expenses decreased by $564,365, or 31%, to $1,240,801 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $1,805,166 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to 
        a decrease of $318,589 in wages and benefits associated with lower 
        headcount, a decrease of $203,119 in lab expenses associated with 
        reduced research and development activities, and a decrease of 
        $108,995 in patent costs, offset by a $100,000 increase in fees owed 
        to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology related to the Pieris 
        license revenue.
      

General and administrative expenses. General and administrative 
        expenses increased by $253,187, or 17%, to $1,745,204 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $1,492,017 for the three 
        months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable 
        to (i) an increase of $218,493 in wages and benefits, resulting from 
        the severance accrual related to Enumeral's former President and Chief 
        Executive Officer, offset by a decrease in bonus accrual, and (ii) an 
        increase of $111,245 in stock compensation expense resulting from 
        options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2016, offset by a 
        decrease of $104,901 in consulting costs.
      

Other income (expense): Other income (expense) decreased by 
        $2,747,375, or 95%, to $139,476 for the three months ended June 30, 
        2016, as compared to $2,886,851 for the three months ended June 30, 
        2015. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $2,737,767 in 
        non-cash income related to the change in the fair value of derivative 
        liabilities primarily associated with the warrants issued in 
        connection with the Company's July 2014 private placement transaction. 
        The Company expects that future changes in the fair value of the 
        derivative liabilities will be due primarily to fluctuations in the 
        value of the Company's common stock and potential exercises of 
        outstanding warrants.
      

Net loss: Net loss increased $1,318,538, or 4,544%, to 
        $1,347,557 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 
        $29,019 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was 
        primarily due to a decrease of $2,737,767 in the change in the fair 
        value of derivative liabilities, offset by an increase of $1,117,659 
        in revenue and a decrease of $311,178 in operating expenses.
