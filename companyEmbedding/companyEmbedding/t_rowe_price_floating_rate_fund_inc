The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the fund's inception. The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity (assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is available the first month after the fund's inception.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Benefits & Risks
The floating-rate feature virtually eliminates interest rate risk.Bank loans typically rank higher in the capital structure for repayment.Low historical return correlations with other asset classes, including high-yield bonds, make bank loans a diversifier for equity and fixed-income portfolios.The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.



Investor Profile

Suitable for an investor seeking high levels of current income.
Appropriate for an investor seeking the diversification benefits that high-yield securities offer equity and investment-grade bond portfolios.
The fund is designed for institutional investors such as banks, pension and retirement plans, and trust and investment companies and has a $1,000,000 initial investment minimum.

				Floating Rate Fund

Investor Class
PRFRX

Invests primarily in institutional floating-rate bank loans and other floating-rate debt securities with below investment-grade credit ratings. Broadly diversified across 125–150 credit facilities, with strict exposure limits to manage risk. 
The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds. This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

Benefits & Risks
The floating-rate feature virtually eliminates interest rate risk.Bank loans typically rank higher in the capital structure for repayment.Low historical return correlations with other asset classes, including high-yield bonds, make bank loans a diversifier for equity and fixed-income portfolios.The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.



Investor Profile
Suitable for an investor seeking high levels of current income.Appropriate for an investor seeking the diversification benefits that high-yield securities offer equity and investment-grade bond portfolios.

Benchmark: S&P/LSTA Performing Loan Index




Sources for Fund Credit Quality Diversification: Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's (S&P); split ratings (i.e. BB/B and B/CCC) are assigned when the Moody's and S&P ratings differ. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency. Short-Term holdings are not rated. Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets. 







The source of credit quality for the S&P/LSTA Performance Loan Index is Standard & Poor's.

				Floating Rate Fund

Investor Class
PRFRX

Invests primarily in institutional floating-rate bank loans and other floating-rate debt securities with below investment-grade credit ratings. Broadly diversified across 125–150 credit facilities, with strict exposure limits to manage risk. 
The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds. This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions.







The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.  If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.







The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of a 2.00% redemption fee on shares held for 90 days or less; if it did, the performance would be lower.

Benefits & Risks
The floating-rate feature virtually eliminates interest rate risk.Bank loans typically rank higher in the capital structure for repayment.Low historical return correlations with other asset classes, including high-yield bonds, make bank loans a diversifier for equity and fixed-income portfolios.The loans and debt securities held by the fund are usually considered speculative and involve a greater risk of default and price decline than higher-rated bonds.This fund could have greater price declines than a fund that invests primarily in high-quality bonds or loans.



Investor Profile
Suitable for an investor seeking high levels of current income.Appropriate for an investor seeking the diversification benefits that high-yield securities offer equity and investment-grade bond portfolios.

Benchmark: S&P/LSTA Performing Loan Index




Sources for Fund Credit Quality Diversification: Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's (S&P); split ratings (i.e. BB/B and B/CCC) are assigned when the Moody's and S&P ratings differ. T. Rowe Price does not evaluate these ratings, but simply assigns them to the appropriate credit quality category as determined by the rating agency. Short-Term holdings are not rated. Numbers may not add due to rounding and/or the exclusion of reserves and other assets. 







The source of credit quality for the S&P/LSTA Performance Loan Index is Standard & Poor's.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is 
      available upon request.

The T. Rowe Price Funds - I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher. 



All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Please visit a fund’s profile page for additional information on its investment objective, strategies, and risks. 



The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's prospectus after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown next to the gross and net expense ratio values above. Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 



Closed to new investors except for a direct rollover from a retirement plan into a T. Rowe Price IRA invested in this fund.



Certain limited exceptions may apply to these scenarios. The funds reserve the right, when in the judgment of T. Rowe Price, it is not adverse to a fund's interest, to permit certain types of investors to open new accounts in a fund, to impose further restrictions, or to close a fund to any additional investments, all without notice.

Asia Opportunities Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in stocks issued by companies that are located in, or that have economic ties to, Asia (excluding Japan). May purchase stocks issued by companies of any size, but typically focuses on large-and mid-cap stocks. The fund is "nondiversified", meaning it may invest a greater portion of assets in a single company and own more of the company's voting securities than is permissible for a "diversified" fund. Further, the fund’s relatively limited geographic orientation and exposure to emerging markets increase its risk level. The fund price is subject to market risk in addition to risks associated with unfavorable currency exchange rates and political or economic uncertainty abroad.

Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. In addition, international investments are subject to settlement practices and regulatory and financial reporting standards that differ from those of the U.S.

Invests at least 80% in the common stocks of financial services companies. The fund may also invest in companies deriving substantial revenues from conducting business with the industry. The fund is less diversified than stock funds investing in a broader range of industries, so it could experience significant volatility. However, dividends paid by financial services firms may moderate this risk. Financial services companies may be hurt when interest rates rise sharply and may be vulnerable to rapidly rising inflation.

Global Consumer Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in securities issued by companies in the consumer sector. The adviser has flexibility in allocating investments between the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors and seeks to identify the best risk adjusted opportunities for the fund based on market conditions and consumer sentiment.Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. International securities tend to be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and may lose value because of adverse local, political, social, or economic developments overseas, or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A fund that focuses its investments in specific industries or sectors is more susceptible to developments affecting those industries and sectors than a more broadly diversified fund. Because the fund invests significantly in companies connected to the consumer staples and consumer discretionary sectors, the fund may perform poorly during a downturn in one or more consumer-related industries and is more exposed to the economic, business or other developments that could adversely impact those industries.

Global Growth Stock Fund


      Subscribe





Invests in target blue chip companies in at least five different countries, including the U.S. It takes a growth approach to investing, seeking opportunities that have potential for above-average earnings. Since the fund invests overseas, its foreign holdings could be affected by declining foreign currencies or adverse political or economic events. The fund’s growth approach carries risk: Because growth funds have higher valuations and lower dividend yields than slower-growth or cyclical companies, the share price volatility may be higher. As such, fund prices could decline further in market downturns than those of non growth-oriented funds.

Global Real Estate Fund

Invests primarily in stocks of real estate companies throughout the world, providing exposure in at least five different countries, including the United States. Changes in tax or zoning laws, overbuilding, environmental issues, changes in interest rates, the quality of property management (REITs), and other factors could hurt the fund. Real estate is affected by general economic conditions. When growth is slowing, demand for property decreases and prices may decline. Rising interest rates, which drive up mortgage and financing costs, can restrain construction and buying and selling activity and may reduce the appeal of real estate investments. Since the fund can invest substantially in foreign securities, it will also be subject to the risks inherent in non-U.S. issues.

Invests in stocks for companies with sustainable above-average earnings growth and a lucrative niche in the economy. Our primary focus is on capital appreciation. Growth stocks can have wide price swings due to the high valuations they may carry. Value stocks carry the risk that other investors will not recognize their intrinsic value or that their low prices are actually appropriate.

Individuals seeking long-term growth of capital who can accept the possibility of more share price volatility than is associated with larger companies or the broad market averages. Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.The fund's strategy relies heavily on quantitative models to analyze data and construct investment portfolios. Relying on quantitative models entails the risk that the models themselves may be limited or incorrect, that the data that the models rely on may be incorrect or incomplete, and that the adviser may not be successful in selecting companies for investment or determining the weighting of particular stocks. Stock prices can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings.

      Subscribe





Individuals seeking long-term growth of capital who can accept the possibility of more share price volatility than is associated with larger companies or the broad market averages. Appropriate for both regular and tax-deferred accounts, such as IRAs.Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by small-and mid-cap companies, it is likely to be more volatile than a fund that focuses on securities issued by larger companies. Small- and medium-sized companies often have less experienced management, narrower product lines, more limited financial resources, and less publicly available information than larger companies. In addition, smaller companies are typically more sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions and their securities may be difficult to trade. The fund's strategy relies heavily on quantitative models to analyze data and construct investment portfolios. Relying on quantitative models entails the risk that the models themselves may be limited or incorrect, that the data that the models rely on may be incorrect or incomplete, and that the adviser may not be successful in selecting companies for investment or determining the weighting of particular stocks. Stock prices can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a particular industry, or specific holdings.

Real Assets Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 80% in "real assets" and securities of companies that are engaged in activities related to, or have substantial ownership of, real assets. Real assets include any assets that have physical properties, real estate, basic materials, equipment, utilities and infrastructure, and commodities. Because the fund focuses its investments in certain industries that involve activities related to real assets, the fund is more susceptible to adverse developments affecting one or more of these industries and may perform poorly during a downturn in any of those industries. During periods of low inflation, the fund's goal of investing in companies that offer some protection from accelerating inflation could lessen relative returns and cause the fund to underperform other stock funds. Since there is no limit on the fund's investments in foreign securities or emerging markets, it will be subject to the risk that some holdings will lose value because of unfavorable currency exchange rates or adverse political or economic developments overseas.

Stocks with growth characteristics can have sharp price declines as a result of earnings disappointments. Stocks with value characteristics carry the risk that the market will not recognize their intrinsic value for a long time or that they are actually appropriately priced at a low level.

Invests at least 80% in bonds, and seeks to offer some protection against rising interest rates and a low correlation with the equity markets. May invest in a variety of debt securities, obligations issued by U.S. and foreign corporations, as well as bank loans.The Fund is subject to the risk that rising interest rates will cause bond prices to fall. The fund is “nondiversified” so its share price can be expected to fluctuate more than that of a “diversified” fund. Investments in foreign bonds are subject to special risks, including potentially adverse overseas political and economic developments, greater volatility, lower liquidity, and the possibility that foreign currencies will decline against the dollar. The fund’s use of derivatives may expose it to additional volatility in comparison to investing directly in bonds and other debt securities.

Invests at least 80% of its assets in bonds, with 65% in investment-grade foreign bonds. It may also invest up to 20% in below investment-grade bonds and up to 20% in dollar-denominated emerging market bonds. International investments are generally more volatile than domestic investments. Because the fund is normally heavily exposed to foreign currencies and does not attempt to hedge the impact of these currencies on the dollar, changes in currency exchange rates are likely to have a significant effect on the fund’s performance.

U.S. Treasury Intermediate Fund


      Subscribe





Invests at least 85% in U.S. Treasury securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. The portfolio's weighted average maturity is expected to range between three and seven years. Primary source of risk is the possibility of rising interest rates, which generally cause bond prices, and a bond fund’s share price, to fall. Longer-term bonds are subject to the greatest price swings because the longer the maturity, the greater the price decline when rates rise and the greater the price increase when rates fall.

Net of fees performance reflects the deduction of the highest applicable management fee ("Model Net Fee") that would be charged based on the fee schedule appropriate to you for this mandate, without the benefit of breakpoints. Please be advised that the composite may include other investment products that are subject to management fees that are inapplicable to you but are in excess of the Model Net Fee. Therefore, the actual performance of all the portfolios in the composite on a net fee basis will be different, and may be lower, than the Model Net Fee performance. However, such Model Net Fee performance is intended to provide the most appropriate example of the impact management fees would have by applying management fees relevant to you to the gross performance of the composite. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 



Returns for time periods greater than one year are annualized.

				Morningstar rated the Floating Rate Fund among 
210,
210,
160
and 
N/A
Bank Loan
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

				Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. 
Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			


				The Floating Rate Fund charges a 2% 
redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. 
The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of the redemption fee; 
if it did, the performance would be lower.
			


2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

		This compare function provides pertinent data to help you make your investment decisions. But there are other factors you will want to consider in your decision, such as the length of time you wish to maintain your investment and the amount of risk you are willing to take in pursuit of your goals.   This compare function allows you to compare funds based on performance history, risk statistics, etc.  Please be aware that funds within the same category may differ in investment strategy, portfolio holdings and risk level.  For this reason, you should not make your investment decision based solely on a comparison of funds' past performance.

			Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, yield, and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. 
For up-to-date standardized total returns, please click here.

 
			The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of redemption fees, if it did, the performance would be lower.
		

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
		
 
			*Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
		

			Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
		

1 The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return.
		

2 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

		

3 The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing 
fund (the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown above) 
and the actual performance results of the I Class since that date.  Because the 
I Classes are expected to have lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I 
Class performance, had it existed over the periods shown, would have been higher.  

				The since inception performance returns are calculated from the investor class inception date indicated above.
				 
			

			    Morningstar rated the Floating Rate Fund among 
210,
210,
160
and 
N/A
Bank Loan 

funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable)
ending 06/30/2017, respectively. 

The Floating Rate Fund received 
4,
3 
and
0
stars for the 3, 5, and 10 year periods (as applicable) respectively.

Net of fees performance reflects the deduction of the highest applicable management fee ("Model Net Fee") that would be charged based on the fee schedule appropriate to you for this mandate, without the benefit of breakpoints. Please be advised that the composite may include other investment products that are subject to management fees that are inapplicable to you but are in excess of the Model Net Fee. Therefore, the actual performance of all the portfolios in the composite on a net fee basis will be different, and may be lower, than the Model Net Fee performance. However, such Model Net Fee performance is intended to provide the most appropriate example of the impact management fees would have by applying management fees relevant to you to the gross performance of the composite. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. 



Returns for time periods greater than one year are annualized.

GIPS® Information

      T. Rowe Price ("TRP") claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). TRP has been independently verified for the 10-year period ended June 30, 2016 by KPMG LLP. The verification report is available upon request. Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
    

      TRP is a U.S. investment management firm with various investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and other regulatory bodies in various countries and holds itself out as such to potential clients for GIPS purposes. TRP further defines itself under GIPS as a discretionary investment manager providing services primarily to institutional clients with regard to various mandates, which include U.S, international, and global strategies but excluding the services of the Private Asset Management group.
    

      A complete list and description of all of the Firm's composites and/or a presentation that adheres to the GIPS® standards are 
      available upon request. 
      Additional information regarding the firm's policies and procedures for calculating and reporting performance results is 
      available upon request.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
