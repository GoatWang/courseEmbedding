 Nathaniel Harris Hooe (1777–1844), a wealthy planter in King George County, eventually owned land and slaves in Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia. In 1807 he married Sarah Daingerfield, who joined her mother Mary Daingerfield in renting slaves to TJ beginning in 1806. At his death Hooe bequeathed a few slaves to various relatives and his executor, but he stipulated that most were to be freed and sent to Africa within three years (TJ to Mary Daingerfield, 11 Mar. 1809, and note; William Saunders Brown Diary, 31 Aug. 1844, 5 Sept., 1 Nov. 1845 [ViU]; Hooe’s will, 17 May, proved 7 Nov. 1844 [ViU]; Washington National Intelligencer, 12 Nov. 1844; Alexandria Gazette and Virginia Advertiser, 3 Nov. 1845).
