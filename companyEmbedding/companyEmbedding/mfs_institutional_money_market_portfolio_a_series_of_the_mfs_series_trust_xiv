We've Got Answers


If you’re interested in opening a Yield Pledge Money Market Account but still have a question or two, we can help. Select from the frequently asked questions below, or call us at 1.855.242.7405 to learn more. Then open an account today so you can start earning top 5% yields2 with total peace of mind.





Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.

A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000.

Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice.

Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.

The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/21/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.

TIAA, FSB is an FDIC insured federal savings association. The standard FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. FDIC insurance covers against loss due to the failure of the institution, but not due to fluctuations in currency values. Due to the nature and volatility of the foreign exchange market, the values of currencies are subject to wide fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency denominated instruments will entail significant risk exposure to adverse movements of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The amount of deposit insurance available for products denominated in foreign currency will be determined and paid in the United States dollar equivalent of the foreign currency, as the value of such currency is determined by the FDIC under its regulations, on the institution's date of default. You can lose money, including principal, due to currency fluctuations. Please only deposit money that you can afford to risk, and as part of a broadly diversified strategy.
EverBank® Metals Select® products:


Are Not FDIC Insured
Are Not Bank or Government Guaranteed
Are Not Deposits

Purchasing or owning metals involves degrees of risk that make them unsuitable for certain individuals. You should carefully consider the suitability of such metals before making any decision. Please refer to the Specific Terms - Metals Select Accounts section in your Account Terms, Disclosures and Agreements Booklet for additional information.

Our bank is the creation of a revolutionary energy similar to that of the 60s. We'd grown sick of the nickel and diming of other banks, so we stepped up. The result is something wholly different.

	LETTER
	FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO





	 




	Dear Shareholders:




	The U.S. economy continues to gain strength. Manufacturing output, construction activity and consumer confidence are all at multi-year highs, auto sales are robust,
	and




	U.S. labor market reports show broad progress. Even a slowdown in the pace of rising house prices is seen as making the market more sustainable. Economists have a favorable outlook, and broad
	stock indices reflect that.




	However, challenges dominate the rest of the global economy. China is struggling to boost its industrial output and
	Japans economic turnaround appears to have hit a setback after its sales tax increase in April. The eurozone economy is being held back by persistently high unemployment and dangerously low inflation, leading the European Central Bank to take
	more




	aggressive stimulus action. With robust corporate earnings, the markets greatest concerns relate to conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. In addition, speculation continues on when the
	U.S. Federal Reserve will begin tightening its monetary policy now that the U.S. economy has regained some traction.




	As always at
	MFS®, active risk management is integral to how we manage your investments. We use a collaborative process, sharing insights across asset classes, regions and economic sectors. Our global team of investment professionals uses a multidisciplined,
	long-term, diversified investment approach.




	We understand that these are challenging economic times. We believe we can serve you best by applying proven
	principles, such as asset allocation and diversification, over the long term. We are confident that this approach can help you as you work with your financial advisors to reach your goals in the years ahead.




	Respectfully,



	 







	Robert J. Manning





	Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

	Total returns as well as the current 7-day yield have been provided
	for the applicable time periods. Performance results reflect the percentage change in net asset value, including the reinvestment of any dividends and capital gains distributions. (See Notes to Performance Summary.)





	Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at
	$1.00 per share, you could lose money on your investment in the fund. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The performance
	shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes, if any, that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

	Yields quoted are based on the latest seven days ended as of August 31, 2014, with dividends annualized. The yield quotations more
	closely reflect the current earnings of the fund than the total return quotations. Shares of the fund can be purchased at net asset value without a sales charge.





	Notes to Performance Summary





	Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies, waivers and
	adjustments in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the funds performance results would be less favorable. Please see the prospectus and financial statements for complete details. All results are historical and
	assume the reinvestment of any dividends and capital gain distributions.

	EXPENSE TABLE






	Fund expenses borne by the shareholders during the period, March 1, 2014 through August 31, 2014





	As
	a shareholder of the fund, you incur ongoing costs, including fund expenses. This example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in
	other mutual funds.




	The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period March 1,
	2014 through August 31, 2014.





	Actual Expenses





	The first line of the following table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with
	the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first line
	under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During Period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

	The second line of the following table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical
	expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual
	ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that
	appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.




	Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only
	and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In
	addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	(1) Business and Organization





	MFS Institutional Money
	Market Portfolio (the fund) is a diversified series of MFS Series Trust XIV (the trust). The trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end management
	investment company. This fund is available only to investment companies managed by MFS. MFS does not receive a management fee from this fund.




	The fund
	is an investment company and accordingly follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946 Financial Services  Investment Companies.




	On July 23, 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted amendments to its money market fund regulations. At this time, management is
	evaluating the potential implications of the changes.





	(2) Significant Accounting Policies






	General

	 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In the preparation of these financial statements, management has evaluated subsequent events occurring after the date of the funds Statement of Assets and
	Liabilities through the date that the financial statements were issued.




	In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-11, Transfers and
	Servicing (Topic 860)  Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures (ASU 2014-11). ASU 2014-11 changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions (i.e., repurchase agreements that settle
	at the same time as the maturity of the transferred financial asset) and enhances the required disclosures for repurchase agreements and other similar transactions. Although still evaluating the potential impacts of ASU 2014-11 to the fund,
	management expects that the impact of the funds adoption will be limited to additional financial statement disclosures which would first be effective for interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015.





	Balance Sheet Offsetting

	 The funds accounting policy with respect to balance sheet offsetting is that, absent an event of default by the
	counterparty or a termination of the agreement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement does not result in an offset of reported amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities in the Statement of Assets and
	Liabilities across transactions between the fund and the applicable counterparty. The funds right to setoff may be restricted or prohibited by the bankruptcy or insolvency laws of the particular jurisdiction to which a specific master netting
	agreement counterparty is subject. Balance sheet offsetting disclosures, to the extent applicable to the fund, have been included in the funds Significant Accounting Policies note under the captions for each of the funds

	in-scope

	financial instruments and transactions.

	Table of Contents





	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 





	Investment Valuations

	 Pursuant to procedures approved by the Board of Trustees, investments held by the fund are generally
	valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Amortized cost involves valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its current market value. The amortized cost value of
	an instrument can be different from the market value of an instrument.




	Various inputs are used in determining the value of the funds assets or
	liabilities. These inputs are categorized into three broad levels. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investments level within the fair value
	hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The funds assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers
	factors specific to the investment. Level 1 includes unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 includes other significant observable market-based inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities,
	interest rates, prepayment speed, and credit risk). Level 3 includes unobservable inputs, which may include the advisers own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments. The following is a summary of the levels used as of
	August 31, 2014 in valuing the funds assets or liabilities:



	 










































	Investments at Value





	  





	Level 1

	For further information regarding security characteristics, see the Portfolio of Investments.





	Repurchase Agreements

	 The fund enters into repurchase agreements under the terms of Master Repurchase Agreements with approved counterparties. Each
	repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The fund requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to a custodian. The fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its value,
	including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the fund under each such repurchase agreement. Upon an event of default under a Master Repurchase Agreement, the

	non-defaulting

	party may close out
	all transactions traded under such agreement and net amounts owed under each transaction to one net amount payable by one party to the other. Absent an event of default, the Master Repurchase Agreement does not result in an offset of reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities across transactions between the fund and the applicable counterparty. At period end, the fund had investments in repurchase agreements with a gross value of $4,899,000
	included in Investments in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The value of the related collateral exceeded the value of the repurchase agreements at period end.





	Indemnifications

	 Under the funds organizational documents, its officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to
	the fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the fund enters into agreements with service providers that may contain




	 




	14







	Table of Contents





	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 




	indemnification clauses. The funds maximum exposure under these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the fund that have not yet occurred.





	Investment Transactions and Income

	 Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
	basis. All premium and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.





	Fees Paid Indirectly

	 The funds custody fee may be reduced according to an arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the fund. This amount, for the year ended
	August 31, 2014, is shown as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.





	Tax Matters and Distributions

	 The fund
	intends to qualify as a regulated investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, and to distribute all of its taxable income, including realized capital gains. As a result, no provision for federal income tax is
	required. The funds federal tax returns, when filed, will remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a three year period. Management has analyzed the funds tax positions taken on federal and state tax returns for
	all open tax years and does not believe that there are any uncertain tax positions that require recognition of a tax liability.




	Distributions to
	shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain capital accounts in the
	financial statements are periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain
	items of income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions for
	financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition or classification of income, expenses, or distributions for financial statement and tax purposes.




	During the year August 31, 2014, there were no significant adjustments due to differences between book and tax accounting.




	The tax character of distributions declared to shareholders for the last two fiscal years is as follows:



	 



























	 




	  





	8/31/14

	Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the Act), net capital losses recognized for fund fiscal
	years beginning after August 31, 2011 may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as short-term and/or

	long-term

	losses (post-enactment losses). Previously, net
	capital losses were carried forward for eight years and treated as short-term losses (pre-enactment losses). As a transition rule, the Act requires that all post-enactment net capital losses be used before pre-enactment net capital
	losses.




	As of August 31, 2014, the fund had capital loss carryforwards available to offset future realized gains. Such pre-enactment losses expire
	as follows:

	(3) Transactions with Affiliates






	Investment Adviser

	 The fund has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to provide overall investment management and related administrative services and facilities to the fund. MFS receives no
	compensation under this agreement.





	Shareholder Servicing Agent

	 MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, provides
	transfer agent and recordkeeping functions in connection with the issuance, transfer, and redemption of shares of the fund under a Shareholder Servicing Agent Agreement. MFSC is not paid a fee for providing these services. MFSC receives payment from
	the fund for out-of-pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the fund. For the year ended August 31, 2014, these costs amounted to $812. The fund may also pay shareholder servicing related costs to non-related parties.





	Administrator

	 MFS provides the fund with certain financial, legal, shareholder, and other administrative services under a Master Administrative
	Services Agreement between the fund and MFS. MFS is not paid a fee for providing these services.





	Trustees and Officers Compensation

	 The fund may pay compensation to independent Trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The fund does not pay compensation directly to Trustees or officers of the fund
	who are also officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the fund from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the fund are officers or directors of MFS, MFD, and MFSC. The independent Trustees do not
	currently receive compensation from the fund.





	Other

	 This fund and certain other funds managed by MFS (the funds) have entered into
	services agreements (the Agreements) which provide for payment of fees by the funds to Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC in return for the provision of services of an Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) and Assistant ICCO,
	respectively, for the funds. The funds can terminate the Agreements with Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC at any time under the terms of the Agreements. The ICCO is an officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. Prior to
	June 1, 2014, Robyn L. Griffin served as the Assistant ICCO and was an officer of the funds. Ms. Griffin is the sole member of Griffin Compliance LLC. Effective May 31, 2014, Ms. Griffin resigned as Assistant ICCO and the service
	agreement between the funds and Griffin Compliance LLC was terminated. For the year ended August 31, 2014, the aggregate fees paid by the fund to Tarantino LLC and Griffin Compliance LLC were

	Notes to Financial Statements  continued





	 




	$27,303. MFS has agreed to reimburse the fund for a portion of the payments made by the fund in the amount of $8,196, which is included in the reduction of total expenses in the Statement of
	Operations. Additionally, MFS has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office space, other administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO and Assistant ICCO.





	(4) Shares of Beneficial Interest





	The funds Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
	unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest.




	The fund is solely invested in by other MFS funds for the purpose of investing
	excess cash balances on a short-term basis. The MFS funds do not invest in this fund for the purpose of exercising management or control. At the end of the period, the MFS International Value Fund, the MFS Emerging Markets Debt Fund, the MFS Growth
	Fund, and the MFS Value Fund were the owners of record of approximately 19%, 13%, 7%, and 6%, respectively, of the value of outstanding voting shares of the fund. No other MFS fund owned more than 5% of the value of outstanding voting shares of the
	fund.





	(5) Line of Credit





	The fund and certain
	other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1.1 billion unsecured committed line of credit, subject to a $1 billion sublimit, provided by a syndication of banks under a credit agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs.
	Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the higher of the Federal Reserve funds rate or one month LIBOR plus an agreed upon spread. A commitment fee, based on the average daily, unused portion of the
	committed line of credit, is allocated among the participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. In addition, the fund and other funds managed by MFS have established unsecured uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks for
	temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds rate plus an agreed upon spread. For the year ended August 31, 2014, the funds commitment fee and interest
	expense were $21,397 and $0, respectively, and are included in Miscellaneous expense in the Statement of Operations.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	To the Board of Trustees of MFS Series Trust XIV and the Shareholders of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio:




	We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the portfolio of investments, of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio (one of
	the series of MFS Series Trust XIV) (the Fund) as of August 31, 2014, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
	the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
	statements and financial highlights based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund is not required to
	have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
	supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
	confirmation of securities owned as of August 31, 2014, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
	financial position of MFS Institutional Money Market Portfolio as of August 31, 2014, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
	highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT





	The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the full Board of Trustees and a majority of the non-interested (independent) Trustees, voting
	separately, annually approve the continuation of the Funds investment advisory agreement with MFS. The Trustees consider matters bearing on the Fund and its advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year, including a review of
	performance data at each regular meeting. In addition, the independent Trustees met several times over the course of three months beginning in May and ending in July, 2014 (contract review meetings) for the specific purpose of
	considering whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory agreement for the Fund and the other investment companies that the Board oversees (the MFS Funds). The independent Trustees were assisted in their evaluation of
	the Funds investment advisory agreement by independent legal counsel, from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from MFS during various contract review meetings. The independent Trustees were also assisted
	in this process by the MFS Funds Independent Chief Compliance Officer, a full-time senior officer appointed by and reporting to the independent Trustees.




	In connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees, including the independent Trustees, considered such information and factors as they believed, in
	light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. The investment advisory agreement for the Fund was considered separately, although the Trustees also took into account the common interests of all MFS Funds
	in their review. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality, and extent of the various investment advisory, administrative, and shareholder services performed by MFS under the existing investment advisory agreement and other
	arrangements with the Fund.




	As part of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account that the Fund was formed solely to act as a cash sweep
	vehicle for other MFS Funds, and that shares of the Fund are not distributed or sold to the public. The Trustees gave substantial consideration to the fact that MFS does not charge a separate advisory fee to the Fund under the investment advisory
	agreement or charge transfer agency fees, administrative services fees, sales loads or distribution and service fees to the Fund, but that MFS receives advisory and other fees from the MFS Funds that invest their cash balances in the Fund.




	In connection with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and relied upon materials that included, among other items:
	(i) information provided by Lipper Inc., an independent third party, on the investment performance of the Fund for various time periods ended December 31, 2013 and the investment performance of a group of funds with substantially similar
	investment classifications/objectives (the Lipper performance universe), (ii) information provided by Lipper Inc. on the Funds fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of comparable funds identified by Lipper Inc. (the
	Lipper expense group), (iii) information as to whether and to what extent applicable expense waivers and reimbursements are observed for the Fund, (iv) information regarding MFS financial results and financial condition,
	including MFS and certain of its affiliates estimated profitability from services performed for the Fund and the MFS Funds as a whole, and compared to MFS institutional business, (v) MFS views regarding the outlook for
	the mutual fund industry and the strategic business

	Table of Contents





	Board Review of Investment Advisory Agreement  continued





	 




	plans of MFS, (vi) descriptions of various functions performed by MFS for the Funds, such as compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and (vii) information regarding the
	overall organization of MFS, including information about MFS senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory, administrative and other services to the Fund and the other MFS Funds. The comparative performance, fee and
	expense information prepared and provided by Lipper Inc. was not independently verified and the independent Trustees did not independently verify any information provided to them by MFS.




	The Trustees conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the Trustees and not the result of any single
	factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the Trustees deliberations are described below, although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another, giving different weights to
	various factors. It is also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the Fund and other MFS Funds are the result of years of review and discussion between the independent Trustees and MFS, that certain aspects of such arrangements may
	receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others, and that the Trustees conclusions may be based, in part, on their consideration of these same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years.




	Based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS, the Trustees reviewed the Funds total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer
	groups of funds over various time periods. The Trustees placed particular emphasis on the total return performance of the Funds shares in comparison to the performance of funds in its Lipper performance universe over the three-year period
	ended December 31, 2013, which the Trustees believed was a long enough period to reflect differing market conditions. The total return performance of the Funds shares was in the 1st quintile relative to the other funds in the universe for
	this three-year period (the 1st quintile being the best performers and the 5th quintile being the worst performers). The total return performance of the Funds shares was in the 1st quintile for the one-year period and the 2nd quintile for the
	five-year period ended December 31, 2013 relative to the Lipper performance universe. Because of the passage of time, these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods, including those shown elsewhere in
	this report.




	In the course of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account information provided by MFS in connection with the contract review
	meetings, as well as during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management personnel during the course of the year regarding the Funds performance. After reviewing these and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the
	context of their overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement, that they were satisfied with MFS responses and efforts relating to investment performance.




	In assessing the reasonableness of the Funds expenses, the Trustees considered, among other information, the total expense ratio of the Funds shares as a percentage of average daily net assets and the
	total expense ratios of peer groups of funds based on information provided by Lipper Inc., noting that the Funds total expense ratio was expected to be relatively low because, as noted above, the Fund does not bear advisory expenses. The
	Trustees considered that, according to the Lipper data (which takes into




	 




	25







	Table of Contents





	Board Review of Investment Advisory Agreement  continued





	 




	account any expense limitations that were in effect during the Funds last fiscal year), the Funds total expense ratio was lower than the Lipper expense group median. Because the Fund
	does not pay an advisory fee, the Trustees did not consider the extent to which economies of scale would be realized due to the Funds growth of assets, whether fee levels reflect economies of scale for the Funds shareholders, or the fees
	paid by similar funds to other investment advisers or by similar clients of MFS.




	The Trustees also considered information prepared by MFS relating to
	MFS costs and profits with respect to the Fund, the MFS Funds considered as a group, and other investment companies and accounts advised by MFS, as well as MFS methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the MFS Funds, the
	Fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability.




	In addition, the Trustees considered MFS resources and related
	efforts to continue to retain, attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the Fund. The Trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial services industry, including the presence of large and well-capitalized
	companies which are spending, and appear to be prepared to continue to spend, substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services to competing investment companies. In this regard, the Trustees also considered the financial resources of MFS
	and its ultimate parent, Sun Life Financial Inc. The Trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the Fund of having an adviser that also serves other investment companies as well as other accounts.




	The Trustees also considered the nature, quality, cost, and extent of administrative, transfer agency, and distribution services provided to the Fund by MFS and its
	affiliates under agreements and plans other than the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also considered the nature, extent and quality of certain other services MFS performs or arranges for on the Funds behalf, which may include
	securities lending programs, directed expense payment programs, class action recovery programs, and MFS interaction with third-party service providers, principally custodians and

	sub-custodians.

	The
	Trustees concluded that the various non-advisory services provided by MFS and its affiliates on behalf of the Fund were satisfactory.




	The Trustees also
	considered benefits to MFS from the use of the Funds portfolio brokerage commissions, if applicable, to pay for investment research and various other factors. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called fall-out benefits to MFS
	such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager to the Fund.




	Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material,
	including those factors described above, the Board of Trustees, including the independent Trustees, concluded that the Funds investment advisory agreement with MFS should be continued for an additional one-year period, commencing
	August 1, 2014.

	AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.







	Messrs. Robert E. Butler, John P. Kavanaugh and Robert W. Uek and Meses. Maryanne L. Roepke and Laurie J. Thomsen, members of the Audit Committee, have
	been determined by the Board of Trustees in their reasonable business judgment to meet the definition of audit committee financial expert as such term is defined in Form N-CSR. In addition, Messrs. Butler, Kavanaugh and Uek, and Meses.
	Roepke and Thomsen are independent members of the Audit Committee (as such term has been defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in regulations implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). The Securities
	and Exchange Commission has stated that the designation of a person as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this Item 3 on the Form N-CSR does not impose on such a person any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the
	duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

	Item 4(e)(1):





	Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and non-audit related services:




	To the extent required by applicable law, pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the Board is needed for all audit and permissible non-audit services
	rendered to the Funds and all permissible non-audit services rendered to MFS or MFS Related Entities if the services relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant. Pre-approval is currently on an
	engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event pre-approval of such services is necessary between regular meetings of the Audit Committee and it is not practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the next regular meeting of the Audit Committee,
	pre-approval of such services may be referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval; provided that the Chair may not pre-approve any individual engagement for such services exceeding $50,000 or multiple engagements for such services in
	the aggregate exceeding $100,000 in each period between regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement pre-approved by the Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall be presented for ratification by the entire Audit

	None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees paid by the Fund and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating directly to the operations and financial reporting
	of the Registrant disclosed above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after the start of the engagement with respect to services other than
	audit, review or attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).

	The Registrants Audit Committee has considered whether the provision by a Registrants independent registered public
	accounting firm of non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved by the Committee (because such services did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant) was compatible with
	maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm as the Registrants principal auditors.

	Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officers





	Effective October 1, 2014




	 






	I.






	Policy Purpose and Summary







	Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that the each MFS Fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 adopt a
	code of ethics for senior financial officers, applicable to its principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.



	 






	II.






	Overview






	 





	 





	A.






	Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code







	This code of ethics (this Code) has been adopted by the funds (collectively, Funds and each, Fund) under supervision of the MFS Funds Board (the Board) and
	applies to the Funds Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the Covered Officers each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:



	 





	 




	




	 





	honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;






	 





	 




	




	 





	full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (SEC) and in other public communications made by the Funds;






	 





	 




	




	 





	compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	accountability for adherence to the Code.












	 





	B.






	Conduct Guidelines







	Each
	Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer should not place his or her personal
	interests ahead of the Funds interests and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Covered Officer must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting for any Fund
	whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit the Fund.







	The following activities, which could create the appearance of a conflict of interest, are permitted only
	with the approval of the Funds Chief Legal Officer (CLO):



	 





	 




	




	 





	service as a director on the board of any for profit company;






	 





	 




	




	 





	running for political office;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
	business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;






	 





	 




	




	 





	any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian banks, audit firms),
	other than the Funds investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for
	selling or redeeming shares, other than an interest arising from the Covered Officers employment or securities ownership.






	 





	 





	C.






	Disclosure and Compliance






	 





	 




	




	 





	Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;






	 





	 




	




	 





	each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within or outside the
	Fund, including to the Funds trustees and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;






	 





	 




	




	 





	each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
	Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the standards and
	restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.












	 





	D.






	Reporting and Accountability







	Each Covered Officer must:



	 





	 




	




	 





	upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he or she has received,
	read, and understands the Code;






	 





	 




	




	 





	annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied with the requirements of the Code;






	 





	 




	




	 





	annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the Covered
	Officers duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;






	 





	 




	




	 





	not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
	that are made in good faith; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.







	The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
	it, granting waivers upon consultation with the appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board
	(or a designee thereof) promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.




	The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has
	occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
	dismiss the Covered Officer.




	Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be disclosed as provided by
	SEC rules.



	 





	 





	E.






	Confidentiality







	All
	reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
	shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds Board, its counsel, counsel to the Boards independent trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Funds investment adviser and its counsel.









	 





	F.






	Internal Use







	The Code is
	intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.



	 






	III.






	Supervision







	The Board of
	Trustees of the Fund, including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, shall review no less frequently than annually, a report from the CLO regarding the affirmations of the
	principal executive officer and the principal financial officer as to compliance with this Code.



	 






	IV.






	Interpretation and Escalation







	Breaches of the Code are reviewed by the CLO and communicated to the Board of Trustees of the affected Fund(s). Interpretations of this Policy shall be made from time to time by the CLO, as needed, and
	questions regarding the application of this Policy to a specific set of facts are escalated to the CLO.



	 






	V.






	Authority







	Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



	 






	VI.






	Monitoring







	Adherence to
	this policy is monitored by the CLO.



	 






	VII.






	Related Policies







	This
	Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the
	Funds, the Funds adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
	overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds and their investment advisers codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their
	investment adviser or other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this Code.



	 






	VIII.






	Amendment







	Any amendments
	to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority of independent trustees.



	 






	IX.






	Recordkeeping







	All
	required books, records and other documentation shall be retained in accordance with MFS related record retention policy.





	Additional
	procedures may need to be implemented by departments to properly comply with this policy.

Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the fund's performance results would be less favorable. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		





Sales Charges
		





Class A shares ("A") results include the maximum sales charge.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, currency, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions.
		





Investments in the utilities sector can be very volatile because of supply and/or demand for services or fuel, financing costs, conservation efforts, the negative impact of regulation, and other factors.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

We've Got Answers


If you’re interested in opening a Yield Pledge Money Market Account but still have a question or two, we can help. Select from the frequently asked questions below, or call us at 1.855.242.7405 to learn more. Then open an account today so you can start earning top 5% yields2 with total peace of mind.





Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.

A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000.

Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice.

This includes data from the 5 largest banks and 5 largest thrifts in each market, except in markets without 5 banks and 5 thrifts.

EverBank promises that the yield on your Yield Pledge® Checking and/or Money Market Account will stay in the Top 5% of Competitive Accounts based on Bankrate Monitor National Index survey data from the last week of each month. "Competitive Accounts" are similar accounts from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 10 large U.S. banking markets. This includes data from the 5 largest banks and 5 largest thrifts in each market, except in markets without 5 banks and 5 thrifts. Each week Bankrate.com surveys these institutions and distributes its results on a paid subscription basis. Not all institutions report each week. EverBank reserves the right to change its Yield Pledge calculation method as necessary to accommodate changes in Bankrate's survey methodology at any time.

TIAA, FSB is an FDIC insured federal savings association. The standard FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. FDIC insurance covers against loss due to the failure of the institution, but not due to fluctuations in currency values. Due to the nature and volatility of the foreign exchange market, the values of currencies are subject to wide fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency denominated instruments will entail significant risk exposure to adverse movements of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The amount of deposit insurance available for products denominated in foreign currency will be determined and paid in the United States dollar equivalent of the foreign currency, as the value of such currency is determined by the FDIC under its regulations, on the institution's date of default. You can lose money, including principal, due to currency fluctuations. Please only deposit money that you can afford to risk, and as part of a broadly diversified strategy.
EverBank® Metals Select® products:


Are Not FDIC Insured
Are Not Bank or Government Guaranteed
Are Not Deposits
May Lose Value


 
Purchasing or owning metals involves degrees of risk that make them unsuitable for certain individuals. You should carefully consider the suitability of such metals before making any decision. Please refer to the Specific Terms - Metals Select Accounts section in your Account Terms, Disclosures and Agreements Booklet for additional information.

				Banking POV
			

                Flying in the face of the status quo
            


Our bank is the creation of a revolutionary energy similar to that of the 60s. We'd grown sick of the nickel and diming of other banks, so we stepped up. The result is something wholly different. It's about opportunity and the freedom to bank when and how you want. It's about a high yield promise.1 It's about believing the client comes first no matter what, then honoring that belief every single day.
For you, it starts now. It starts at EverBank.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
