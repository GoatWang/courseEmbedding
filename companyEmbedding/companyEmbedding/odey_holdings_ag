Odey


















To be a successful long term investor you must think like an owner - know when to take risk and when to preserve capital.

I launched Odey Asset Management in 1991 with this 'owners' approach and have worked hard to build an investment team and a client base who share these beliefs. Today we manage c. $6.0bn* for many of the world's leading investors and have an exceptional performance record across our conventional and hedge fund portfolios (* as at 30 June 2017).

If you would like to learn more about us, please do get in touch.

Information on this Site
In the United Kingdom, the Odey group operates a number of
regulated entities (collectively referred to as "Odey").
The information on this website ("Information") is issued by
Odey Asset Management LLP, a limited liability partnership
incorporated in England and Wales under number OC305952, authorised
and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA").
Information on this website about Odey Opportunity Fund is
issued by Odey Wealth Management (C.I.) Limited ("OWMCI"), a
limited company registered in Guernsey under number 48037. It is
licensed by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission ("GFSC"). It
has its registered office at PO Box 533, Level 3 (North), St
Julian's Court St Julian's Avenue, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1
6EY.
The Information is not directed at any person or entity.
The Information is intended only for use by users domiciled in the
United Kingdom and is not intended for distribution or use in any
jurisdiction or country where it is illegal or unlawful to access
and use such information. Non-UK investors should consider their
local regulations before considering investment. Odey disclaims all
responsibility if you access or download any Information in breach
of any law or regulation of the country in which you
reside.
The Information is not directed at any person or entity
in the United States, and this site is not intended for
distribution or to be used by any person or entity in the United
States unless those persons or entities are existing investors in
funds managed by Odey and they have applicable US
exemptions.
Accordingly, all persons who access this site are required to
inform themselves of and to comply with all applicable sales
restrictions in their home country. 
Sales Restrictions
United Kingdom: certain of the funds referred to in the
restricted part of this site (the "Restricted Area") more commonly
known as hedge funds are not recognised collective investment
schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 of the United Kingdom (the "Act"). The promotion of such funds
and the distribution of offering materials in relation to such
funds in the United Kingdom is accordingly restricted by law.
The information contained in the "Restricted Area" is only
available to and directed only at persons to whom such funds may
lawfully be promoted by a person authorised under the Act (an
"authorised person") by virtue of Section 238(5) of the Act and
Chapter 4 (Part 12) of the FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook.
Information must not be relied or acted upon by any other
persons.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not regulated under
the UK's financial services regulations and investors in those
funds will not benefit from the rules and regulations made under
the Act for the protection of investors or from the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme.
Shares in the hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not dealt
in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the
purposes of the Act, nor is there a market maker in such shares,
and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of his
shares.

it.
An application for shares in any of the funds referred to on
this site should only be made having read fully the relevant

performance. The value of investments and the income from them may
go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount

The hedge funds in the Restricted Area may be subject to higher
risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.
Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and
the income arising from them to rise or fall.
The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change.
Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their
value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor.
Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to

risk. The Information does not constitute an offer to buy or sell

incorporated in England and Wales under number OC305952 ("Odey"),
authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority
("FCA").
Information on this website about Odey Opportunity Fund is
issued by Odey Wealth Management (C.I.) Limited ("OWMCI"), a
limited company registered in Guernsey under number 48037. It is
licensed by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission ("GFSC"). It
has its registered office at PO Box 533, Level 3 (North), St

The Information is intended only for use by users domiciled in the
EU and is not intended for distribution or use in any jurisdiction
or country where it is illegal or unlawful to access and use such
information. Investors should consider their local regulations
before considering investment. Odey disclaims all responsibility if

regulation of the country in which you reside.
The Information is not directed at any person or entity
in the United States, and this site is not intended for
distribution or to be used by any person or entity in the United
States unless those persons or entities are existing investors in
funds managed by Odey and they have applicable US
exemptions.
Accordingly, all persons who access this site are
required to inform themselves of and to comply with all applicable
sales restrictions in their home country.
Sales Restrictions
Certain of the funds referred to in the restricted part of this
site (the "Restricted Area") more commonly known as hedge funds
 are not recognised collective investment schemes for the
purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the
United Kingdom (the "Act"). The promotion of such funds and the
distribution of offering materials in relation to such funds in the
United Kingdom are accordingly restricted by law.
The information contained in the "Restricted Area" is only
available to and directed only at persons to whom such funds may
lawfully be promoted by a person authorised under the Act (an
"authorised person") by virtue of Section 238(5) of the Act and
Chapter 4 (Part 12) of the FCA Conduct of Business Sourcebook.
Information must not be relied or acted upon by any other
persons.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not regulated under
the UK's financial services regulations and investors in those
funds will not benefit from the rules and regulations made under
the Act for the protection of investors or from the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme.
Shares in the hedge funds in the Restricted Area are not dealt
in or on a recognised or designated investment exchange for the
purposes of the Act, nor is there a market maker in such shares,
and it may therefore be difficult for an investor to dispose of his
shares.
Access to the Restricted Area requires possession of a valid
password and no other person should attempt to gain access to
it.
An application for shares in any of the funds referred to on
this site should only be made having read fully the relevant
prospectus.

Should you have any queries about the investment funds referred to
on this site, you should contact your financial adviser.
Risk Factors
Past performance is not an indication of future
performance. The value of investments and the income from them may
go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount
invested. Consequently, you are not certain to make a profit on
your investments and you may lose money.
The hedge funds in the Restricted Area may be subject to higher
risk and volatility than other funds and may not be suitable for
all investors. These funds are not regulated.
Exchange rates may cause the value of overseas investments and
the income arising from them to rise or fall.
The levels and bases of and reliefs from taxation may change.
Any tax reliefs referred to are those currently available and their
value depends on the circumstances of the individual investor.
Investors should consult their own tax adviser in order to
understand any applicable tax consequences.

forecast) has been obtained from, or is based on, sources believed

risk. The Information does not constitute an offer to buy or sell
or an invitation to make an offer to buy or sell shares in any
investment fund referred to herein.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.
      

        Pro subscription required to use hedging strategies
      
Hedging Strategy:

      

No Hedging

          Short-Exposure Hedge
        

          Moving Average Hedge
        

Moving Average Months:


Moving Average Target:
                   

Your backtested portfolio
S&P 500 TR Index
Russell 2K TR Index

the moving average that will determine when hedging is on or off

Hedging %:
      

25%
50%
75%
100%



Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
    
Starting Quarter:
      
All Available Dates


  Ending Quarter:
