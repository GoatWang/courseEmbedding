What We Do
Colonial Trust is an independent wealth management firm, providing investment, fiduciary, and advisory services to individuals, families, and institutions for over 100 years. We serve our clients from four locations across South Carolina.




Investment Management



Once we understand our client’s financial landscape and goals, we create a personalized solution, considering their objectives and constraints. The investment aspects include strategic asset allocation and portfolio construction consistent with our quality, long-term oriented investment philosophy.
  Current economic conditions and valuations are key when making strategic investment decisions. Developing a thesis on both requires research. We utilize resources from leading financial institutions, independent third party providers, and our own proprietary research.
  We typically manage individual securities complemented by low-cost passive strategies. We use discretion and objectivity to help our clients invest wisely. This allows for transparency and typically a lower fee structure than product based solutions.



Trust & Fiduciary Services



We are proud to be the only private trust company in South Carolina. We provide similar capabilities and infrastructure to a bank trust department with the family feel of a boutique firm. Our private ownership structure allows us to provide more consistent, multigenerational relationships and our independence gives our trust officers the flexibility to make the most objective decisions for their clients.
  We serve in professional fiduciary roles for all types of personal trusts including Testamentary, Living, Charitable, Special Needs, and Insurance Trusts. We also offer family office services, estate settlements, and other unique fiduciary roles.
  Each family is complex in their own way, and naming an individual to carry out an estate plan can put tremendous strain on relationships. As objective professionals, we’re used to playing the delicate role of balancing opposing interests. The relationships we develop can extend far beyond today, making our longevity an asset for our clients.



Financial Advisory Solutions



Our financial advisory solutions are not offered as stand-alone services, but are valuable complements to our client-centered philosophy. The more in-depth we understand a client’s financial program, the more effective we can be in serving them. We help clients create a comprehensive plan that provides a clear framework for our investment and fiduciary decisions. As a result, our clients find us focused on more than a short-term investment result. Success is achieved with a steady hand and a long-term perspective.
