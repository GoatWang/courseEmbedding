About Us









 


Our Story:
In 1997 Advanced Inhalation Revolution (AIR-2) established itself as the leading developer of premium vaporizers. These digital units offered a smokeless alternative that allowed users to enjoy the flavor of their favorite herbs and flowers without the risks associated with smoking. By removing the combustion element from the equation, our premium vaporizer invites users to indulge in flavor without the risk. As our success grew and our reputation reached far and wide, we identified the next step in our progress. By November of 2006, we incorporated Vapir, Inc. within the state of California.
 
What We Do:
Vapir, Inc. specializes in the revolutionary technology of digital vaporization. The process of vaporization extracts all of the therapeutically beneficial compounds from choice herbs and flowers into a vapor cloud. Vapor can be safely inhaled without irritation or negative side effects - unlike smoke (aka combustion), which results in carcinogens and other harmful compounds entering your lungs. We’ve mastered the craft of Digital Vaporization to ensure absolute flavor, incredible potency, and unrivaled freshness with every vapor cloud.
 
What We Create:
At Vapir, Inc., we invent, develop, and produce digital vaporizers in both desktop and portable varieties. All of our vaporizers offer precise temperature control, LCD displays, elegant design, and premium materials for a truly superior vapor experience.
Utilizing heat and convection air means our vaporizers use hot air instead of direct contact with a heating element. This guarantees smooth, well-balanced exposure that results in an incredibly flavorful and potent vapor cloud. Vapir Vaporizers extract the natural compounds found in your choice herbs, flowers, and oils without ever burning anything!
 
Our Mission
At Vapir Inc., our mission is to deliver the ultimate digital aromatherapy experience. We are committed to the development, production and perfection of world-class vaporizers at a price point that our customers can afford. We intend to revolutionize the field of vaporization all while providing the best-in-class customer support and service to our patrons.
We love our customers and we strive to be the best at what we do.

Why Vaporize











Vapir Vaporizers integrate elite technology with sophisticated design. Our scientific background gave us the insight necessary to create a cutting-edge convection system that gently massages the active compounds from any herb or essential oil into a delicious and healthy vapor cloud.
 We’ve employed clinical components like the stainless steel vapor path and brass or ceramic heating elements. Vapir believes quality construction delivers for exceptional purity and flavor – and Rise is another form of proof for this concept. All of our premium vaporizers are digitally controlled and designed to maximize the consistency, safety, and potency of your vapor sessions.
 To get a better understanding – imagine fresh-squeezed orange juice: you don’t want the seeds, the pulp, or any of the bitter stuff in your glass. You’re focused on experiencing 100% Orange Juice when you squeeze fresh oranges! Well, a Vapir Vaporizer works like a great juicer except, instead of extracting the juicy goodness from fruits and veggies, our vaporizers extract the therapeutic potency of your favorite herbs. In other words, our vapor technology provides 100% vapor-liciousness without the gross-tasting and unhealthy stuff found in smoke!
 Vapor doesn’t contain the contaminants and poisons found in smoke: it doesn’t matter what you’re smoking. The very act of burning causes a chemical reaction! These reactions may form new (and sometimes unhealthy) compounds. A vaporizer with an accurate thermostat, on the other hand, allows you to avoid many of the health risks associated with smoking while still capturing the instant health benefits of various medicinal herbs.
 Using a premium vaporizer means you’re choosing a healthy experience! If you need consistent relief – stop smoking and start vaporizing. Rid yourself of the downsides of smoking and start vaporizing with Vapir! Digital Vaporization is on the verge of revolutionizing the: Aromatherapy Industry Medicinal Vaporization contributes to the: Pharmaceutical Industry, Biotech Industry, and Dietary Supplement Industry.

What is a Vaporizer?
A vaporizer is a device which is used to vaporize active ingredients of plant material such as tobacco, or other herbs.

Its construction is fairly simple: a chamber, which can be heated, and a pipe to inhale the vaporized product.  Since there is no combustion occurring the efficiency is improved in the extraction process.  This reduces the harmful effects of direct smoking.

The temperature is important in the vaporizing process as too high of a temperature will result in the loss of the active ingredients.

There are various forms of vaporizers available.  Most are battery powered for portability and ease of use.  Vaporizers are generally used as a substitute for cigarettes or other types of smoking.

One of the primary reasons why people choose a vaporizer, as opposed to traditional modes of smoking, is that vapor appears to be safer.  There are not the noxious fumes that cigarettes may produce and the many carcinogens that are in cigarettes.  Though long term studies have yet to be performed, there is widespread thoughts that the effects on the lungs may be limited and less than smoking tobacco.

Vaporizers are also used, by many, as a method of quitting traditional cigarettes.

                                This vaporizer is portable and powerful. Heats up in no time.  The battery lasts long and recharges quickly. Also very easy to clean and maintain - much easier to clean than my NO2.  Absolutely worth the expense.                  (Posted on 9/4/2016)

                                such a great device. i have owned a variety of vaporizers over the years from the Majic Flite, to the heavy-duty tabletop vaporizers. this is by far the best vaporizer ive owned. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to transport. It is also one of the SAFEST devices as well. It has safeguards built into the design that help to prevent the user from environmental and recreational hazards from vaping. It is so versatile as well. I can use it for dried herb, oils, and other concentrates. It is the only device you will ever need.                 (Posted on 8/16/2016)


Best Portable Vaporizer On The Market Review by B' 






Overall

                                I just got the Prima 1 week ago and i LOVE it! It handles all substances perfectly well. The temp options are easy to use and offer all the temp options you will need. It is extremely easy to use and easy to clean. I got an extra battery and recommend that for extended use. Also i got the case and the bubbler. The case holds everything you would need, including the bubbler and is the only way to go to keep the unit and accessories all portable. Saved the best for last, the bubbler is well worth the extra $. It makes the largest difference for oil's and concentrates. It makes them SO SMOOTH it is a must. You don't "need" it for dry herb, but it does make everything better and you are cutting yourself short if you do not purchase a bubbler. All in all it is the best portable vape i have ever used and i have tried 7 portable vaporizors that i can recall. 

Get one or you are simply missing out! Happy Vaping!                (Posted on 8/3/2016)


Prima/Primo Review by Ed 






Overall







Performance







UserFriendliness

                                I have been using the Vapir product line for several years now. I am currently an advocate of the PRIMA system, I have consulted a biologic scientist as well as my Nuephrologist (Kidney Specialist) on the use of vaporizors for my condition(s). The information that I recieved was that Vapir has combined a rapid heat source within a controlled chamber. This rapid heating has the ability to destroy any foriegn microbiologic substance as well as fungus and or molds. This is an important quality for any individual who has a comprimised immune system, Microbiologic impurities and fungus if ingested can cause severe illness including death. The use of a Vaporizor also allows those who have undergone body cavity surgeries which can diminish the patients ability to inhale deeply. I also consulted with my Glaucoma specialist and been given the "OK" for use of a Vapir Vaporizor as it tends to negate the deep coughing that occures with other forms of ingestion. Severe coughing episodes have a tendency to create the blood vessels in the Eye to rupture and cause further damage. I as a patient applaud Vapir inc. in their continued pursuit of perfection with all of it's products.
 Thank you,

The flavor of your chosen herb depends on the temperature. If the temperature is too high, you will be inhaling a taste similar to burnt leaves. When too low, it wouldn’t have much of a taste at all. With the NO2.V2 you can depending on your personal preferences, choose the temperature which you think best suits your chosen herb. It is designed for use with numerous different herbs and heats up to your preferred set temperature in mere moments. The temperature is clearly displayed on an LCD in Celsius or Fahrenheit for your vaping convenience. Just remember the maximum temperature is 400 degrees Fahrenheit or 204 degrees Celsius. Temperatures higher than this should be avoided at all times, to ensure that you have only pleasurable vaping sessions.

                                Cons: it is a bit large and dinosaur looking
Pros: have had the product for over 10 years and not once has there been a problem with it. Truly a excellent vaporizer that does everything you need. It is very durable and a lot healthier alternative to smoke with. The price is very reasonable for what you get. it is a MUST BUY for novices and experts in the vape industry.

                                I've had the same No2 for 5 years (V1) and its been a wonderful charm. This is a vaporizer you get to learn and cherish very quickly. This year I had to open it up for maintenance and I have to applaude the build quality. It's built to last. 

The only thing that ever failed was the power. First the power cord poking bit, then the poking bit receptacle inside the unit later on. Ez repair for a dolla. That is, after 4 years and a half of daily abuse.                (Posted on 4/19/2017)

                                Have had three of these units for at least 5 years and their performance is great.  Easy to use except you do need some type of "pick" to be able to remove the used screens from the heating chamber.  I found one of those portable metal dental picks work great to grab the screen edge and pull it out of the chamber.  The reason I have had more than one is that the main switch on one quit working after the warranty period and the second units charging port malfunctioned and it would only work on battery mode so I needed a backup unit.  Otherwise this vaporizer is highly recommended by me.                (Posted on 3/3/2017)

                                I've had my Vapir NO2 since its inception & continue to be pleased with it. I have never had to replace any parts nor the battery. For most of these years, I naively overfilled it & heated it to the max. I had to call customer service once for clarification of use. They answered my questions promptly & courteously.                 (Posted on 2/4/2017)

I'd strongly recommend this product, if you are looking for a vape that can be used every day then this product is nothing short of durable.                  (Posted on 9/14/2016)

                                I am currently on my fourth NO2. It's not that they don't last, but rather I have used them for eight years and I mean I use this thing a bunch numerous times daily). I am a two time cancer survivor with some serious residual issues including severe neuropathy and I vaporize to stay off as much pain medicine as I can. I have tried several vaporizers but hands down, this has always been my favorite. The flavor that this thing produces is nothing short of spectacular. The only thing I would like to see is maybe a slightly smaller unit but this critique is a bit of a nitpick. I will soon be needing to purchase another one and I assure you, the NO2 will be the choice for me. Do yourself a favor and check the NO2 out. You will not be disappointed.
