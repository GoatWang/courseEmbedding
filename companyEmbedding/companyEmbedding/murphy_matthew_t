Employees







Murphy, Matthew T.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Sullivan County:













Does Murphy, Matthew T carry a valid contracting license?



Any person or business involved in a home improvement project more than $200 must get a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs to operate legally in New York.
Murphy, Matthew T currently holds license M-401 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Sullivan County?



New York City maintains high standards for licensing. To obtain a home improvement license, applicants must pass a written exam.











Your liability risk when hiring Murphy, Matthew T



Licensed contractors in NYC are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Murphy, Matthew T



Licensed contractors contribute $200 to DCA's Trust Fund at the time of application and each time they renew or post a bond. DCA's Trust Fund reimburses homeowners who hired a licensed contractor who subsequently damaged their home and went out of business or left town.











What else should I know before hiring Murphy, Matthew T



NYC home improvement contractors are required to submit a copy of their fingerprints to the DCA and pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
