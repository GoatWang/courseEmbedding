2016-2017 Master Classes
November 8, 2016: Isabel Leonard
“She’s the real deal and it shows,” says Philadelphia magazine of mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard. In repertoire ranging from Vivaldi to Mozart to Thomas Adès, she has graced the stages of such celebrated venues as the Paris Opera, Salzburg Festival, Lyric Opera of Chicago, and San Francisco Opera. A recipient of the Richard Tucker Award, she is featured on the Grammy-winning recording of Adès’s The Tempest. This season she appears as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia at the Vienna State Opera and as Charlotte in Werther at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna and the Metropolitan Opera, where she will also be seen as Zerlina in Don Giovanni.

January 18, 2017: Matthew Polenzani

The Boston Phoenix declares, “Matthew Polenzani has perhaps the finest tenor voice of his generation.” Winner of a 2004 Richard Tucker Award and the Metropolitan Opera’s 2008 Beverly Sills Artist Award, Polenzani appeared in 2015–16 at the Paris Opera in Don Giovanni, at the Bavarian and Vienna State Operas in Werther, and at the Metropolitan Opera in Les pêcheurs de perles and Roberto Devereux. Season highlights for 2016–17 include a return to the Bavarian State Opera for Die Zauberflöte, La Favorita, and La Bohème and to the Metropolitan Opera for Don Giovanni, Idomeneo,and Der Rosenkavalier, as well as Die Zauberflöte at Lyric Opera of Chicago.

April 20, 2017: Jake Heggie

This special Tichio Vocal Master Class features celebrated composer Jake Heggie at the piano, accompanying Bienen School students in performances of his songs. The Wall Street Journal calls Heggie “arguably the world’s most popular 21st-century opera and art song composer.” His operas Dead Man Walking, Moby-Dick, Great Scott, Three Decembers, To Hell and Back, Out of Darkness, At the Statue of Venus, and The Radio Hour: A Choral Opera have been produced on five continents. A Guggenheim Fellow and recipient of the Eddie Medora King Prize from the University of Texas-Austin’s Butler School of Music, he is a frequent guest artist and master teacher at universities, conservatories, and festivals throughout North America. He has collaborated as composer and pianist with such opera-world luminaries as Kiri Te Kanawa, Renée Fleming, Frederica von Stade, Joyce DiDonato, Susan Graham, Bryn Terfel, Nathan Gunn, and Robert Orth. His opera It’s A Wonderful Life, based on the classic Frank Capra movie and written with librettist Gene Scheer, is slated for a December 2016 premiere at Houston Grand Opera.
More Information



2015-2016 Master Classes
October 29, 2015: Lawrence Brownlee
The New Yorker’s Alex Ross raves, “With his sweet tone, fastidious pitch, and poetic phrasing, Brownlee made familiar fare sound intriguingly fresh, banishing, for a moment, the ghosts of Caruso and Pavarotti.” Brownlee has appeared on the stages of the Metropolitan Opera, Teatro alla Scala, Royal Opera Covent Garden, and Opéra national de Paris, among others. During the 2014–15 season he made his role debut as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni with Seattle Opera, appeared at the Met as Count Almaviva in Il barbiere di Siviglia, and played Don Ramiro opposite Cecilia Bartoli at Opernhaus Zürich in La Cenerentola. This summer he premiered the role of Charlie Parker in Yardbird at Opera Philadelphia.
Bienen students who participated in this master class were Chelsea Betz (mezzo-soprano), Nathan Ward (tenor), Regina Ceragioli (soprano), and Dimitri German (baritone). 
March 7, 2016: Susanna Phillips
Recipient of the Metropolitan Opera’s 2010 Beverly Sills Artist Award, soprano Susanna Phillips has established herself as one of today’s most sought-after vocalists. Anthony Tommassini of the New York Times observes, “She has the purity and bloom of a Mozart lyric soprano. Yet her voice can lift phrases with penetrating sound and deep richness.” During the 2014-15 season she returned to the Metropolitan Opera to star as Antonia in Les contes d’Hoffmann, in addition to appearances as the Countess in a Lisbon production of Le nozze di Figaro and the title role in Handel’s Agrippina with Boston Baroque. Her orchestral engagements included a performance of Fauré’s Requiem with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and a return to the San Francisco Symphony for Mahler’s Fourth Symphony.
Bienen sopranos who participated in this master class were Amanda Menzie, Jennie Moser, Kaileigh Riess, and Bahareh Poureslami. 
April 5, 2016: Marilyn Horne
Opera News declares, "Marilyn Horne--whose face and song have been the light--in so many places, in so many styles, through so many media, for so many years--may be the most influential singer in American history." The mezzo-soprano's numerous honors and awards include multiple Grammys, a National Medal of the Arts, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and as a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by France's Ministry of Culture. From regular engagements with the Metropolitan Opera and San Francisco Opera to recordings and recitals highlighting folk and popular music, her career has spanned an impressive variety of genres. Committed to excellence in vocal art, she is the voice program director at Santa Barbara's Music Academy of the West and holds residencies at the University of Oklahoma and Oberlin Conservatory.
Bienen students who participated in the master class were Rachel Girty (mezzo-soprano), Kevin Krasinski (baritone), Kaitlin Zardetto-Smith (mezzo-soprano), Alexander York (baritone), and Chelsea Lyons (mezzo-soprano). See photos from this event.
April 30, 2016: Matthew Polenzani
Steve Winn of the San Francisco Classical Voice praises tenor Matthew Polenzani’s “torrent of magnificent sound…from the sonorous, deep pedal points of his low notes to the glittering, high shine at the upper reaches.” He is the recipient of the 2004 Richard Tucker Award and the Metropolitan Opera’s 2008 Beverly Sills Award. His 2014-15 season included his return to London’s Royal Opera House for Idomeneo, productions of Les contes d’Hoffmann at the Metropolitan Opera, L’elisir d’amore and Die Zauberflöte at Munich’s Bayerische Staatsoper, and his Opernhaus Zurich debut in La traviata. 2015-16 season highlights include appearances in Don Giovanni at Opéra national de Paris, productions of Werther in Munich and Vienna, and Les pêcheurs de perles and Roberto Devereux at the Metropolitan Opera.
Bienen students who participated in the master class were Michael Powell (tenor), Alexandra Urquiola (mezzo-soprano), Eric McConnell (bass), and Sam Grosby (tenor). See photos from this event.



2014-2015 Master Classes


May 2, 2015: Frederica von Stade

Described by the New York Times as “one of America’s finest artists and singers,” mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade is one of the music world’s most beloved figures. Her more than 60 recordings for every major label—including complete operas, aria albums, symphonic works, solo recital programs, and popular crossover albums—have garnered six Grammy nominations, two Grand Prix du Disque awards, the Deutsche Schallplattenpreis, and “Best of the Year” citations by Stereo Review and Opera News.
Bienen students who participated in this master class were Jeanne Ireland (mezzo-soprano), Madison Leonard (soprano), Harrah Friedlander (soprano), and Kelsey Park (mezzo-soprano).

February 2, 2015: Eric Owens

Bass-baritone Eric Owens has earned international acclaim as both an esteemed interpreter of the classics and a champion of new music. His career highlights include Aida at Houston Grand Opera, his San Francisco Opera debut in Otello, and his Covent Garden debut in Norma. Owens’s 2014–15 season engagements include Bach’s St. Matthew Passion at the Lucerne Festival, Porgy and Bess at Lyric Opera of Chicago, where he is currently serving as community ambassador, and his debut in the title role of Der fliegende Holländer with the Washington National Opera.
Bienen students who participated in this master class were Kyle Sackett (baritone), Sanghun Han (baritone), Emily Barnash (soprano), Donovan Ott-Bales (tenor), and Cody Montá (baritone).

In February 2014 she became the first classical singer ever to perform the national anthem at the Super Bowl. Her 2014–15 season engagements include performances at Lyric Opera of Chicago, New York’s Metropolitan Opera, and Semperoper Dresden.

"Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?"



To prove. 
That faith is more important than fact. 
          That my church can be more empowering than a boardroom. 
          This is what I wish to prove with my one precious life. 
To become a father, son, brother and husband, not simply 
          be one. 
          That each and every life has purpose. 
          To elucidate that purpose to those who may despair or who are hopeless. 
          
          To find those people not on the other side of the globe, but in the 
          cubicle next door. 
That relationships will be my legacy. 
          That my life will be marked not by the content of my accomplishments 
          but rather by the breadth of my ambitions. 
That changing one person's life matters. 
          That I may make a difference in the community in which I live and with 
          the people that I know. And that will be an accomplishment satisfying 
          enough.
          That celebrating others is the noblest of all life's undertakings. 
That at the end of my days I may be called a witness. 
          
          A witness to the indomitable human spirit and the Hand that guides it.
