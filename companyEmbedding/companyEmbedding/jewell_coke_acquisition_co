History
50 years of cokemaking experience
SunCoke Energy has a rich history in coal mining and cokemaking. Our past successes give us the confidence and determination to prosper and grow our company.

Jewell Coke Plant in Vansant, Virginia
Starting in coal mining at our metallurgical coal mining operations, SunCoke Energy’s operations have grown over the years to include five coke plants in the Americas.
SunCoke Energy’s cokemaking process started when B. Ray Thompson built three test ovens in Vansant, Virginia in the early 1960’s. A four month test found that coke could be made from Virginia coal. Production was scaled up during the next ten years. In 1969, 450,000 tons of coke were produced per year at what is now our Jewell cokemaking facility.
Production continued to expand into the 1970’s when 16 large Jewell-Thompson ovens were built, increasing capacity by 80,000 tons per year. In the early 1980’s, SunCoke Energy improved its technology with enhanced combustion control and oven construction techniques, thereby enhancing coke quality. Then in the late 1980’s, we developed new technologies and processes to monitor and control oven temperatures increasing our coking cycles to 48 hours.
With a mature and robust coke oven technology, SunCoke Energy continued to improve its coke quality and coal-to-coke yield through the 1990's. During that time we also implemented our heat recovery/power generation technology.
As a result of the design improvements and extensive operational know-how developed since we began coke production in 1962, we believe that we possess the most advanced and environmentally sound cokemaking technology in the industry.  Our oven design and operational practices also allow us to produce more electricity from our heat recovery process than any competing heat recovery technology.
Today, SunCoke Energy currently operates metallurgical coke plants in Vansant, Virginia; East Chicago, Indiana; Haverhill, Ohio; Granite City, Illinois; Middletown, Ohio; and Vitória, Brazil . These facilities produce over 5 million tons of coke each year.

Memorandum Order that ArcelorMittals complaint has failed to allege facts that amount to more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. The fact that the illustration prepared by Jewell included the allegedly correct formula is consistent with Jewells liability, but, in light of the other facts alleged--as well as those facts not alleged--by ArcelorMittal in the complaint, the complaint stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief. Id. (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, Counts I and III of ArcelorMittals complaint are dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).

Before EDWARDS and CELEBREZZE, Circuit Judges, and ZIRPOLI,* Senior District Judge.
EDWARDS, Circuit Judge.


1
Plaintiff McLouth Steel Corporation, the tenth largest steel producer in the nation, filed this complaint under the diversity jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, against Jewell Coal and Coke Company, a Virginia corporation with principal offices in Knoxville, Tennessee, and its affiliated coal companies, seeking enforcement by injunctive relief of a contract for sale and purchase of coke used in McLouth's furnaces.  The contract was executed in 1961 with an initial term of 15 years and an option on McLouth's part to extend same for an additional 15 years.


2
The District Judge who heard this 54-day trial found all issues in favor of McLouth.  He held the contract to be "an unambiguous requirements contract" and that Jewell was obligated to supply all coke (over 59,000 tons a month supplied under another contract) which McLouth required and ordered.  He issued a mandatory injunction requiring Jewell to furnish coke as McLouth ordered it and to build replacement or new production facilities as needed to accomplish same.  He reserved for later adjudication any Jewell claims of production cost increases due to inflation or antipollution laws.  He also reserved computation of McLouth's claims for breach of contract damages and Jewell's counterclaims for similar damages.  He then certified that the judgment was a final one and that there was no just reason for delay of this appeal, under Rule 54(b).


3
This case reminds us of stories from the Klondike gold rush of partners who willingly shared danger, cold and starvation in the search for gold and then fought (sometimes to the death) for sole possession of the gold strike with which fortune favored them.


4
Here in the early 1960's, at a time when the coal industry was greatly depressed, McLouth Steel Co. contracted with Jewell Smokeless Coal Corp.1 for Jewell to build a coke plant and furnish coke to McLouth for 15 years, the contract being renewable at McLouth's option for another 15 years.  The unilateral nature of the option which is now the major source of controversy is explicable in that Jewell, in the midst of lean years, approached McLouth with the proposal that McLouth give it a binding contract for coke which would provide Jewell with the necessary cash flow to secure the capital required to build a coke plant.  The parties lived under the contract without major dispute until coal once more became king of the energy producers of the United States and its value went up in multiples.  Then, suddenly, McLouth wanted to buy more coke than it had ever bought and Jewell wanted to supply much less.  Each, as might be guessed, found reasons.  This bitter controversy resulted.


5
We find it impossible to describe the contract which is the center of this litigation without employing words which have interpretative shadings.  In view of its relative brevity, we quote it in full, with the paragraphs which we believe to be critical emphasized:


6
This Agreement, made and entered into this 21st day of August, 1961, by and between Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Virginia, with an office in Knoxville, Tennessee, hereinafter called the "Seller", and McLouth Steel Corporation, a corporation with an office in Detroit, Michigan, hereinafter called the "Buyer".

Witnesseth:

7
That the Seller hereby agrees to sell and the Buyer hereby agrees to buy and pay for, coke, under the terms and conditions, for the period hereinafter named, and the price hereinafter stated.


8
Term of Contract: This contract shall become effective as of the first day of May, 1963, and continue for a period of fifteen (15) years from that date with an option on the part of the Buyer to renew the contract for an additional term of fifteen (15) years by written notice to Seller on or before November 1, 1976, on the same terms and conditions as herein stated.


9
Quantity: The coke to be purchased and sold hereunder shall be Buyer's requirements of Blast Furnace Coke in excess of the amount which it is presently obligated to purchase from Semet-Solvay Division, Allied Chemical Corporation.  Buyer's contract with Semet-Solvay Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, is dated May 12, 1960, and requires that, after April 30, 1963, Buyer is obligated to purchase from them the first 59,000 CTM BRT 11/22/61 (handwritten changes underlined) net tons of coke per month.  It is estimated that Buyer's requirements in excess of said purchases from Semet-Solvay Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, will average approximately 18,000 net tons of coke per month, and Buyer agrees that in no case shall purchases from Seller hereunder average less than 9,000 net tons per month.


10
Quality: Coke to be delivered hereunder shall be of Blast Furnace Quality, sized 1  X 4 , with an average analysis as follows:

Fixed Carbon  94% with a plus or minus
1/2 of 1% tolerance

11
Ash           5.5
Volatile       .50
Sulphur        .65/.75
Stability     54 minimum
Porosity      50
Moisture       3% maximum


12
Price: $14.25 per net ton f. o. b. cars at ovens, Vansant, Virginia.


13
Basis for Escalation: The base price per ton of coke listed herein is based on the present cost of producing, processing, washing and delivering coal to the coke ovens in effect as of the date of this contract at the mines of Seller.  This present cost is $5.20 per ton.  Effective at the end of each six months' period ending November 30 and May 31 during the term of this contract, there shall be added to or deducted from the price per net ton of coke f. o. b. oven to Buyer any increase or decrease in this cost due to change in wage rates, cost of supplies, taxes, laws, or any other item affecting this cost (of producing coal) as follows: For each variation of 10cents in the cost (of producing coal), the price per ton of coke to Buyer shall be adjusted 15cents per ton up or down.  Coke plant labor shall also be escalated using as a base the wage scale in effect when the coke plant is placed in production.


14
Coal: The coal from which such coke is to be derived shall be from Seller's present miners to analyze approximately: 25.00 Volatile; 69.50 Fixed Carbon; 3.5 to 4.5 Ash; and .75 Sulphur.


15
Deliveries: Coke shall be delivered in approximately equal weekly quantities.  Each shipment must, however, be of not less than the 25-car minimum which is required to secure the best freight rate advantage.


16
Weights: Railroad track scale weights shall establish the quantities which are being shipped, but in no case should cars of coke be weighed within twelve (12) hours after quenching.


17
Payment: Buyer will pay Seller within fifteen (15) days after Buyer's billing, which shall be monthly.


18
Contingencies: It is understood that Seller's failure to deliver, or Buyer's failure to accept, said coke in the event, and during the continuance, of any action by governmental authority (whether now or hereafter effective) preventing performance of this agreement in accordance with its terms, or failure to make or accept deliveries hereunder when due, if occasioned by act of God or the public enemy, fire, explosion, flood, war, riots, sabotage, strike, action of any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises, or any circumstance beyond either party's reasonable control, shall not subject such party to any liability to the other party hereto.


19
Buyer shall have the right to purchase from other sources any part of Buyer's coke requirements which Seller shall fail to supply Buyer.


20
In Witness Whereof, the parties hereto have set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.


21
(Emphasis added.)

HISTORY OF THE 1961 CONTRACT

22
The record discloses that, prior to the signing of this contract, Jewell was in the business of processing, cleaning and selling high grade, low sulphur metallurgical coal from mines which it held under leases.  Prior to 1963 it had never been in the business of producing blast furnace coke, a material which plaintiff McLouth used in great quantity for firing its furnaces.


23
Faced with losses in 1959 and an excess of current liabilities over current assets in 1960, the Thompson family, which owned controlling interests in and ran Jewell and its affiliated coal companies, contacted McLouth and initiated discussions of Jewell's undertaking to build a coke plant and supply a portion of McLouth's needs for coke.  The contracting parties understood from these discussions that if Jewell built the plant, it would need to borrow capital therefor, and that the contract would have to contain a minimum take or pay monthly tonnage purchase guarantee from McLouth to Jewell.  All through the negotiations Jewell was informed and understood that McLouth already had a 10-year contract with Semet-Solvay Division of Allied Chemical Corporation, for McLouth to purchase 59,000 tons of the coke it used each month from Semet-Solvay.  When it developed that 9,000 tons take or pay would probably serve to provide sufficient cash flow for financing the necessary coke plant construction loan for Jewell, the last sentence of the contract paragraph labeled "Quantity" was drafted by McLouth.


24
McLouth drafted this in terms of "Buyer's requirements of Blast Furnace Coke in excess of the amount which it is presently obligated to purchase from Semet-Solvay Division," and concluded with its estimate: "Buyer's requirements in excess of said purchases from Semet-Solvay Division, Allied Chemical Corporation, will average approximately 18,000 net tons of coke per month, and Buyer agrees that in no case shall purchases from seller hereunder average less than 9,000 net tons per month."


25
With this contract in hand, Jewell proceeded to secure the necessary financing from Aetna Insurance Company and to build 210 "Mitchell"-type nonrecovery coke ovens at a site in Vansant, Virginia, which ovens had an approximate capacity of 20,000 to 22,000 tons of coke per month.2  Operations under the contract continued with both parties in reasonable accord as to its operation for some years.


26
In 1965 Jewell, without consulting McLouth or seeking any contract amendment, expanded its coke capacity to between 28,000 to 30,000 tons of coke per month by adding 44 ovens of a different type.  In 1966 McLouth ordered and Jewell supplied an average of 26,643 tons per month.


27
In 1967 and 1968, however, McLouth advised Thompson, of Jewell, that its monthly requirements would be substantially increased as a result of a changeover to a continuous casting process and discussed with him the expansion of Jewell's coke facilities so as to provide an estimated 36,000 tons per month.  McLouth and Jewell tentatively agreed to amend the 1961 contract by changing 9,000 to 18,000 tons and 18,000 to 36,000 tons, thus doubling the minimum take or pay and doubling the estimate in the old contract.  Although there were serious discussions about amendment of the contract to this purpose, they broke down on disagreements on other terms.  Meantime, relying on McLouth's commitment to amend the contract, Jewell proceeded to build additional capacity up to 45,000 tons a month without outside financing.  The 1961 contract was never formally amended, but McLouth exercised its option to extend it for the second 15-year period.


28
During the first six months of 1971, the District Judge found Jewell shipped to McLouth an average of 35,418 tons of coke per month, partly from the new ovens which it had built which were known as Plant No. 2.  Thereafter, the situation concerning this contract changed markedly in two important respects.  First, Jewell became acutely aware, partly as a result of consulting Stone & Webster, of the possibility that it could sell coke on the open market in excess of its contract price, plus escalation, with McLouth.  Second, McLouth, which had up to then recognized the need to amend the contract to secure Jewell's commitment to supply 36,000 tons per month, began to demand 40,000 tons per month as a matter of right under the 1961 contract.


29
Additionally, the air pollution laws of the State of Virginia and the federal government began to appear ominously upon the horizon.  The Virginia Air Pollution Control Board entered an order requiring Jewell to cease and desist operating Plant No. 1 by July 1975, and Jewell argued before this court that Plant No. 2 might be similarly affected by Virginia's air pollution standards.  With this outline of the history of this contract, we turn to the most important of the legal issues.


30
THE DISTRICT JUDGE'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS


31
The District Judge held that the contract we have printed above was a "requirements contract," that it was "unambiguous," that it was executed in Michigan and should be interpreted in accordance with Michigan law, and that under it Jewell was obligated to meet all of McLouth's increased requirements (which McLouth now estimates at 44,000 tons per month).  He also held that if the Virginia air pollution standards, or those of the federal government, require replacing old coke-making facilities and building new facilities, Jewell is required by its contract so to do.  In all these respects the District Judge held for McLouth, adding only that if after expansion of facilities it developed that higher construction costs demanded by the necessity of installing machinery to meet air pollution standards imposed "an unconscionable burden," Jewell could move under Paragraph 8 of the judgment entered by the District Court for a price adjustment to meet said situation.  Needless to say, appellee McLouth supports the District Judge in all of these respects.

APPELLANT'S CONTENTIONS

32
Jewell contends that in the first instance the District Judge erred in determining the contract to be a "requirements contract," and particularly erred in ignoring the 18,000 ton per month estimate contained therein, turning it into a total requirements contract which McLouth now estimates may ultimately mean 51,000 tons per month, which McLouth may need and Jewell, under terms of the judgment, would be obligated to supply.


33
Jewell contends the District Judge erred in interpreting the contract under Michigan law, arguing that it was finally executed in Connecticut where the last conditions were fulfilled by Aetna's agreement to provide the financing.


34
Jewell also argues that the District Court erred in ignoring the large mass of parol evidence and holding that the contract did not need explanation by parol evidence since it was unambiguous.


35
In addition, Jewell contends that the contract should be construed as an agreement for Jewell to supply McLouth from the production (20,000 to 22,000 tons) of the Mitchell ovens only, and that since these ovens can no longer be operated legally, the contract is terminated.


36
Additionally, Jewell argues that the District Judge has failed to give effect to the portion of the contract which exempted the seller from liability for failure to deliver, based upon "action by any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises, or any circumstance beyond either party's reasonable control," and cites in this regard the impact of the federal environmental protection laws and the Virginia air pollution control standards.


37
Finally, by motion for rehearing filed after the District Judge's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law had been entered, Jewell argues that the 1961 contract, as interpreted and proposed to be enforced by the District Judge, represented an "acquisition" of all of Jewell's assets by McLouth and thus violated §§ 3 and 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 14, 18 (1970), and § 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 (1970).


38
IS THIS CONTRACT SUBJECT TO MICHIGAN LAW?


39
Taking the issues of this case in logical sequence, and stating them as we see them, we note the District Judge's conclusions pertaining to the law which controls interpretation of this contract:


40
Michigan conflict of laws rules apply.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., 313 U.S. 487 (61 S. Ct. 1020, 85 L. Ed. 1477) (1941).  Under Michigan law, interpretation of contract provisions are governed by the law of the state in which the contract was entered into.  Chrysler Corporation v. Insurance Co. of No. America, 328 F. Supp. 445 (E.D.Mich.1971); Rubin v. Gallagher, 294 Mich. 124, 128 (292 N.W. 584) (1940).  In Michigan, a contract is deemed to be made in the state where the last act necessary to make it a binding agreement took place, State of Ohio v. Eubank, 295 Mich. 230 (294 N.W. 166) (1940).  The last necessary act for the formation of the 1961 agreement between these parties took place in the State of Michigan when Murphy of McLouth signed the agreement that had already been executed in the State of Tennessee.  Insertion of the words "the first" in the quantity clause of the contract by Murphy did not serve to modify the contract nor did it constitute a counter offer.  This is so because the parties thereafter, in writing and by their conduct, treated the insertion of these words as a "minor change" or a "slight change" which did not affect the substance of the provision and only served to clarify the words immediately following (DX 529, 530; Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts, Section 73, 78 (Jaeger Ed. 1975)).  Therefore, this agreement was consummated in Michigan (and) is governed by the laws of the State of Michigan.


41
We agree with the District Judge's conclusion on this point.  Under these facts it is clear to us that appellant's contention that the District Court had no jurisdiction over Jewell is erroneous.3


42
IS THE CONTRACT "UNAMBIGUOUS" AS VIEWED BY THE DISTRICT JUDGE?

On this issue the District Judge held:

43
The language in the contract binding upon these parties is unambiguous and, therefore, must be given its natural and ordinary meaning.  A court may not strain interpretation to find ambiguity where none exists.  Elston-Richards Storage Co. v. Indemnity Insurance Co., 194 F. Supp. 673 (W.D.Mich.1960); Muir v. Leonard Refrigerator Co., 269 Mich. 406, 408 (257 N.W. 723) (1934); New Amsterdam Co. v. Sokolowski, 374 Mich. 340, 342 (132 N.W.2d 66) (1965).  The parol evidence rule applies after it is established that the written contract is a complete and final expression of the agreement between the parties.  Such an agreement may not be varied or contradicted by proof of an antecedent agreement or prior negotiations.  The written contract supersedes and nullifies prior negotiations and antecedent agreements or understandings.  The sole purpose for allowing Jewell to submit parol evidence was to permit Jewell to prove its contention that the language in the written contract was latently ambiguous, Goodwin v. Coe Pontiac, 392 Mich. 195 (220 N.W.2d 664) (1974).  Such evidence did not establish an ambiguity and, therefore, may not now be considered to vary or contradict the plain meaning of the words used in the contract between these parties.


44
We do not agree.


45
The District Judge's entire Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Declaratory Judgment rely upon one sentence of the contract:


46
The coke to be purchased hereunder shall be Buyer's requirements of Blast Furnace Coke in excess of the amount which it is presently obligated to purchase from Semet-Solvay Division, Allied Chemical Corporation.


47
The District Judge construed this sentence to represent an undertaking on Jewell's part to furnish any and all coke over 59,000 tons required by McLouth for a period of 30 years in the event McLouth exercised its option.  Jewell's undertaking, according to the District Judge, was absolutely without limit.  He held that this sentence controlled, regardless of other provisions of the contract or the then existing relationships of the parties, or the then existing or foreseeable coke needs of McLouth's plants, or the nature and capacity of the coke production facilities which Jewell was to construct or constructed, or the amount of coal Jewell and its affiliates were capable of mining (or having mined), or owned or had under lease.  In fact, the District Judge construed the contract so broadly in McLouth's favor that he enjoined Jewell to "produce and sell to McLouth . . .  all of McLouth's blast furnace coke requirements in excess of 59,000 tons per month" and to "construct further additional coke producing facilities to satisfy such increase in McLouth's requirements."  He also ordered that Jewell (even if it had first exhausted its own production) satisfy McLouth's requirements by the alternative means of "the purchase of coke on the open market or the carbonization by others of coal from its reserves."


48
We cannot find the contract described by the Declaratory Judgment of the District Judge either in the four corners of the document itself, or in the actions, relationships, words, or writings of the parties.


49
Far from being unambiguous, the contract which we quoted at the outset is actually beyond understanding if interpretation be confined to the words of the document.  The simplest illustration of this is that it is dated "this 21st day of August, 1961," and contains as one critical sentence, "Price: $14.25 per net ton f. o. b. cars at ovens, Vansant, Virginia," even though no ovens existed in 1961.  It also says in the escalation clause: "Coke plant labor shall also be escalated, using as a base the wage scale in effect when the coke plant is placed in production."  The parties fully understood, although the contingency was nowhere expressed in the document, that the contract was not to be effective at all until and unless Jewell (with the McLouth 9,000 ton per month take or pay contract in hand) succeeded in arranging the necessary financing for the construction of a then nonexisting coke plant.  It is clear on this record that Jewell in 1961 could not have built any coke plant at all absent the McLouth 9,000 ton "take or pay" guarantee.


50
This is by no means the only gap or ambiguity in the contract which requires reference to the surrounding circumstances and the actions and positions of the parties.  The contract also provides: "The coal from which such coke is to be derived shall be from Seller's present mines . . . ."  The term "present mines" is not defined in any manner in the contract, and evidence on that score would have to be supplied from outside the contract itself.  This is particularly true here where Jewell's mine holdings were (and are) exercised through a considerable number of affiliated companies and leases.  This provision also directly contradicts the portion of the District Judge's declaratory judgment which makes Jewell responsible for purchasing coke or coal on the open market in order to supply whatever amount of coke McLouth might order.  Jewell has never been in the coke brokerage business.


51
The clause entitled "Contingencies" particularly the phrase "beyond either party's reasonable control" bristles with ambiguity.


52
Additionally, the contract includes as its last operative paragraph entitled "Contingencies," "Buyer shall have the right to purchase from other sources any part of Buyer's coke requirements which Seller shall fail to supply Buyer."  We find here an explicit recognition of McLouth's knowledge that the financing Jewell would be seeking would be based on the 9,000 ton take or pay guarantee and that the plant would be built to supply the 18,000 ton estimate and not all of the coke McLouth might need in the course of 30 years.  Reading this sentence together with the 9,000 ton take or pay provision and the 18,000 ton estimate of McLouth's requirements from Jewell in the Quantity clause (which we will deal with more fully in the next section of this opinion), the contract cannot be properly defined or interpreted under Michigan law without reference to the then existing and contemplated plant and equipment of both parties to the contract.


53
In short, we believe that the District Judge was right when he spent 54 days of trial listening to all the circumstances surrounding this contract, that he was likewise correct in relying on that mass of testimony in drawing his Findings of Fact, but that he fell into legal error when he purported to base his Conclusions of Law solely upon the limited and frequently ambiguous words of the contract itself.


54
In similar cases of ambiguity Michigan law clearly provides for the court's taking and considering evidence pertaining to the situation of the parties at the point of contract and to their contemporaneous and subsequent expressions and actions interpreting the document.  In Marx v. American Malting Co., 169 F. 582 (6th Cir. 1909), this court stated what we believe to be the Michigan law applicable then and now to the evidentiary question here involved:


55
But the court below took another view of the stipulations of this contract, and held that the words, "Amount of malt to be used will be between 15,000 and 20,000 bushels," constituted a limitation upon the words, "Quantity, all their requirements to December 31, 1907."  Accordingly all evidence given or offered to show the conditions and circumstances in which the contract was made, and in reference to which the parties were dealing, was, either directly or by the effect of instructions, put aside.  There could be no complaint of this if the view which the court took of the contract was correct.  The evidence referred to, however, was for the information of the court, and to enable it to rightly construe the agreement; and the effect of the ruling was to say that the language was clear and no aid was needed to interpret it.  As we have said, we reach a different conclusion.  We think such evidence was competent for the purpose for which it was offered.  It was not disputed, and it disclosed highly important facts in aid of the right construction of the agreement.  We do not say that all of the evidence offered was admissible for this purpose.  Mere words passing from one to another of the parties about matters which were subsequently reduced to writing were not admissible to alter, cut down, or enlarge the terms of the contract; but whatever had reference to the conditions and the probable requirements of the business which the vendee expected, and the knowledge of these conditions and expectations by the respective parties, was admissible.  Within the rule, we think it was competent to prove by parol evidence that the vendor was informed of the conditions of the vendee's business and of the enlargement of the plant, and of the probable increase of the requirements resulting therefrom.  Runkle v. Burnham, 153 U.S. 216, 224, 14 S. Ct. 837, 38 L. Ed. 694; Scott v. United States, 12 Wall. 443, 20 L. Ed. 438; Bell v. Bruen, 1 How. 169, 11 L. Ed. 89; Nash v. Towne, 5 Wall. 689, 699, 18 L. Ed. 527; 9 Cyc. 587, where it is said:


56
"To determine the intention of the parties, if the meaning is not clear, it is necessary that regard shall be had to the nature of the instrument itself, the condition of the parties executing it, and the objects which they had in view, for which purpose parol evidence is admissible."


57
Marx v. American Malting Co., supra at 585.  (Emphasis added.)


58
IS THIS AN ENFORCEABLE "REQUIREMENTS" CONTRACT UNDER MICHIGAN LAW?


59
We believe this contract in many ways is sui generis.  Two of the biggest law firms in Detroit have labored mightily to find Michigan law which can be regarded as controlling and neither has presented a case which comes close to approximating the fact situation presented here.  The typical "requirements" contracts cases of the early 1900's which were relied upon by the District Judge and are McLouth's primary reliance on this appeal, involved contracts for one party's requirements of a certain product for a specific period of time usually a year or less.  Most included an estimate of the amount of the product dealt in by the parties.


60
It is clear to us, as it was to the District Judge, that Michigan case law up to the effective date of the Michigan Uniform Commercial Code in 1964 has treated an estimate in a requirements contract as only that and not as a maximum figure or "cap."  Likewise, preceding case law varied from the underlined portion of Mich.Comp.Laws § 440.2306(1) (1967) (U.C.C. 2-306(1)):


61
Sec. 2306.  (1) Output, requirements.  A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.


62
(Emphasis added.)


63
Michigan case law prior to 1963 allowed enforcement of a good faith requirement which exceeded the contract estimate even if it could be termed "unreasonably disproportionate" to the estimate.  See Marx v. American Malting Co., 169 F. 582 (6th Cir. 1909); E. G. Dailey Co. v. Clark Can Co., 128 Mich. 591, 87 N.W. 761 (1901); F. B. Holmes & Co. v. City of Detroit, 158 Mich. 137, 122 N.W. 506 (1909); Menominee Lumber & Cedar Co. v. Thomson, 309 Mich. 263, 15 N.W.2d 155 (1944).


64
In each of these cases, however, the emphasis of the court was upon the known or foreseeable quantity required by the buyer or produced by the seller.  The court looked to what the parties knew at the time of contract about each other's plant or business, rather than to any stated estimate.


65
In F. B. Holmes v. City of Detroit, supra, the court said:


66
We find no difficulty in ascertaining the prime object and purpose of these parties as expressed in the writings considered.  They had in mind so many barrels of cement as the operations of this department would require during this period.  The exact amount of cement which would be required could not be known at the time of entering into the contract, as the first meeting of the board of estimates does not occur until in March.


67
F. B. Holmes v. City of Detroit, supra, 158 Mich. at 142, 122 N.W. at 507-08.


68
In Menominee Lumber & Cedar Co. v. Thomson, supra, the court said:


69
The necessity of harvesting and storage was imperative and known to defendant, who also knew that ice not requisitioned would be a total loss to plaintiff.


70
Menominee Lumber & Cedar Co. v. Thomson, supra, 309 Mich. at 268-69, 15 N.W.2d at 157.


71
In Marx v. American Malting Co., supra, this court said:


72
(I)t is a fundamental rule in the interpretation of agreements that we should ascertain the prime object and purpose of the parties, and, in case of ambiguity produced by its minor provisions, the latter should, if possible, be so construed as not to conflict with the main purpose.  It is clear enough that these parties had in mind, not the sale of a certain number of bushels of malt, but so much as the business of the vendee would require during the period mentioned.


73
Marx v. American Malting Co., supra at 584.


74
In E. G. Dailey Co. v. Clark Can Co., supra, the Supreme Court of Michigan said:


75
Many of the improvements now complained of were either then completed or were in progress at the time the contract was made.  There is evidence to show that Clark knew of these improvements; that he went through plaintiff's plant; that he congratulated plaintiff's manager, Dailey, upon the increase of business; that Dailey informed him that its business was growing; that he wanted a contract to deliver him just as many cans as were needed; and that Dailey told him the company contemplated building a new brick building, so as to further extend the business.


76
E. G. Dailey Co. v. Clark Can Co., supra, 128 Mich. at 597, 87 N.W. at 763.


77
We draw three legal principles from these cases.  The first is that in Michigan (prior to the Uniform Commercial Code) an estimate in a requirements contract did not control over the good faith needs of the ordering party.  The second is that good faith need would be judged by the courts on the basis of what each contracting party knew about the nature of the other's business at the point of contract.  The third principle is that requirements contracts were legally enforceable under Michigan law in 1961 and 1963 when the McLouth-Jewell contract came into being.


78
Finally, we observe that, although the McLouth-Jewell contract is poles apart from the contracts illustrated above in quantity and value and time of performance, we find no legal distinction which defeats its enforceability.


79
WHAT REQUIREMENTS ARE ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE CONTRACT?


80
The most difficult question we have to determine is the amount of coke which this contract requires Jewell to deliver on McLouth's demand.  In this regard we look to the contract itself, the parties' known or reasonably foreseeable needs or capabilities and the interpretation of the contract by the parties themselves in the course of its performance.


81
There were four definable stages of contract performance which require consideration.  They may be designated by the year concerned.

THE 1963 STAGE

82
Neither party to this dispute denies that the contract which we have quoted in full above was entered into freely and that it became enforceable at least by 1963 when the 210 Mitchell ovens were built and placed in operation.  As of then, Jewell could have required McLouth to take and pay for the minimum 9,000 tons per month of coke provided in the contract, and McLouth could have demanded that Jewell provide it with all of the coke the Mitchell ovens were capable of producing, a figure which this record establishes at between 20,000 and 22,000 tons per month.


83
The only basis on which Jewell now seeks to avoid its commitment to supply McLouth with the approximate tonnage referred to immediately above is because of Virginia air pollution controls.  This issue has yet to be tried, and we do not purport to make any disposition of it.  We do, however, agree with the District Judge that no facts currently before us serve to terminate Jewell's obligation to perform the contract absent future proofs of impossibility.


84
In short, to the extent that the District Judge's Declaratory Judgment applied to the originally developed production of 20,000 to 22,000 tons of coke per month, we regard the District Judge's order enforcing the contract as valid.  This tonnage is consistent with the specific wording of the contract.  It is in reasonable accord with the 18,000 ton estimate contained therein, although Michigan law in 1963 did not require such accord.  It is consistent with the foreseeable needs of the McLouth operation as of the time of the signing of the contract.  It is also consistent with the interpretation of the parties themselves in carrying the contract into effect.  The record is clear that Jewell readily complied with McLouth's orders up to (and exceeding) 22,000 tons.

THE 1966 STAGE

85
The critical feature of this contract dispute concerns whether or not the conduct of the parties between 1963 and 1967 shows that the parties themselves interpreted the contract as calling for additional tonnage up to 26,643 tons per month.  The District Judge's findings (which are fully supported by the evidence on this score) include these facts.  1) McLouth in 1966, without any basic change in plant, increased its orders to Jewell to an average of 26,643 tons per month; 2) Jewell, without consulting McLouth, built 44 additional Australian-type ovens at the Vansant site; 3) Jewell received and supplied McLouth's requirements for coke up to the 26,643 figure; and 4) both parties clearly relied on the 1961 contract for such important matters as price, quality, and delivery in the furnishing and receipt of the 26,643 tons of coke.


86
The Michigan Supreme Court provides this statement concerning the importance of the construction of a contract by the parties' actual performance under it:


87
"It is to be assumed that parties to a contract know best what was meant by its terms and are the least likely to be mistaken as to its intention; that each party is alert to protect his own interests and to insist on his rights; and that whatever is done by the parties during the period of the performance of the contract is done under its terms as they understood and intended it should be.  Parties are far less likely to have been mistaken as to the meaning of their contract during the period when they are in harmony and practical construction reflects that meaning than when subsequent differences have impelled them to resort to law and one of them then seeks a construction at variance with their earlier practical construction of its provisions."


88
Detroit Greyhound Employees Federal Credit Union v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 381 Mich. 683, 692, 167 N.W.2d 274, 279 (1969) (quoting 17 Am.Jur.2d, Contracts § 274, at 685 (1964)).


89
Since the parties themselves freely construed this contract to require delivery of 26,643 tons of coke, we hold the contract is also enforceable up to this quantity.

THE 1968 STAGE

90
Starting in 1967 McLouth launched a major change in its steelmaking processes.  It spent well over $100,000,000 to change over to a continuous casting system (concast), thus increasing its steelmaking capacity and increasing its need for coke.  In 1968 McLouth initiated discussions with Jewell to increase Jewell's productive capacity to 36,000 tons per month which McLouth felt it would need.  McLouth recognized, concurrently with the development of the continuous casting plan, that the additional tonnage which McLouth would want from Jewell as a result of the concast development would require a new or amended contract.  In contrast to the 44 Australian-type ovens which Jewell built on its own initiative, McLouth this time initiated discussion of Jewell's expansion.  What follows is 1968 correspondence between the principal negotiator for McLouth, G. E. Gann, and the principal negotiator for Jewell, B. R. Thompson, plus an internal memorandum from Gann to other McLouth executives, which demonstrate conclusively that both parties considered further tonnage expansion to be beyond the terms of the 1961 agreement.  Thus on April 26, 1968, in a McLouth internal memorandum, after discussing the possibility of increasing the 59,000 tons per month from Semet-Solvay by another 20,000 tons, Gann turned to consideration of Jewell as a prospective supplier for its increased needs and said as follows:


91
The balance of our coke requirements, up to 23,000 tons per month, comes from Jewell Smokeless Coal Company on a long term contract ending May 1, 1978.  The current price delivered is $20.18 also subject to escalation.  This contract covers all our requirements in excess of the 59,000 net tons presently obligated to Semet-Solvay, up to their plant capacity or their ability to produce.


92
Jewell Smokeless is faced with an air pollution problem that is synonymous with the small Mitchell Type Bee Hive oven that he now operates.  The best way and the cheapest way to lick this problem is to convert all his ovens to the large Australian Sole Flue type ovens which would simplify his smoke problem.  One hundred of these big ovens would permit him to increase his monthly production rate to above 40,000 net tons.  More than enough to take care of any foreseeable increase in requirements by us.


93
On May 15, 1968, Gann wrote Thompson the following letter:


94
As a result of our many conversations and discussions about our future coke requirements and the extent of Jewell Smokeless participation, we would like to confirm the following understanding.


95
(A) From now till June 30, 1970 McLouth will commit to Jewell Smokeless all of their coke requirements over and above the 59,000 tons monthly now committed to Semet Solvay.


96
(B) Beginning July 1, 1970 McLouth will commit to Jewell Smokeless all of their coke requirements over and above 65,000 tons monthly that will then be committed to Semet Solvay.


97
These commitments of course will be contingent on the ability of Jewell Smokeless to perform and assurance to this affect must be forthcoming as soon as possible.


98
Under the terms of our present contract we are committed for 9,000 to 18,000 tons per month.  We agree our new contract should read 18,000 to 36,000 tons per month.


99
It would be our intention to simply amend our present contract to cover these changes and to incorporate any other thinking that we might mutually agree upon.


100
In response to Gann's May 15 letter, on November 4, 1968, Thompson wrote Gann as follows:


101
Please be advised that Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation has begun construction of 30 coke ovens, size 50 x 11, to enable us to manufacture approximately 42 to 45,000 tons of coke per month and we anticipate now that production will begin twelve to fifteen months from this date.  Our exact target date will depend, as you know, on the availability of materials.


102
We are embarking on this construction program based on your assurance that our supply contract with you dated August 21, 1961, will be amended so as to increase the maximum tons to be purchased thereunder from 18,000 tons of coke per month to 36,000 tons of coke per month, and the minimum to be purchased from 9,000 tons per month to 18,000 tons per month.


103
We trust that the above is the assurance which you requested of this company in your letter of May 15, 1968.


104
While the letters we have quoted would seem to indicate that both parties were in mutual agreement concerning the new contract, the facts proved to be quite different.  McLouth wanted the contract to be increased to the new quantities at the original 1961 base price, plus escalation.  It also wanted to continue Semet-Solvay as the supplier of first choice from whom McLouth was obligated to buy the first 59,000 (or 65,000) tons of coke.  Jewell wanted an increase in the per ton price of coke and wanted to be on a parity with Semet-Solvay in the event McLouth again faced months or years of lower production and lower demand for coke.  These conflicts were never resolved and no amended contract, let alone new contract, was ever signed.  The fact that agreement was not reached does not, however, alter the mutual recognition in 1968 that the 1961 contract could not properly be construed to cover the McLouth needs produced by the concast system.

THE LITIGATION STAGE (1971 until Now)

105
The coke ovens, called Plant 2, which Jewell started to build in 1968 in reliance on McLouth's promise to amend the contract, were completed by 1970.  They were built with a technology aimed at compliance with environmental laws.  They increased Jewell's coke production by 21,000 tons.  For a time Jewell supplied McLouth's increased needs from Plant 2 also.  In the first six months of 1971, the District Judge found Jewell shipped an average of 35,418 tons of coke per month.


106
The parties were, however, moving farther apart in their interpretation of the contract.  Jewell, aware of higher prices for coke on the spot market, began selling coke to others (some on long-term contracts) and began telling McLouth it could not meet McLouth's needs.  McLouth began to take the position (regardless of the prior negotiations to amend the contract) that it was entitled to all the coke it ordered from Jewell.  On June 29, 1971, it wrote Jewell a letter ordering 40,000 tons of coke per month, "under the terms of our contract."  Jewell refused to supply this quantity, and after further unsuccessful negotiations, McLouth filed the instant complaint on December 1, 1972.


107
Pending this litigation, the parties continued in business together as a result of what they called a "tire patch" agreement negotiated May 31, 1972.  At least through 1974 Jewell has been supplying up to 28,000 tons of coke per month on McLouth's orders.  The "tire patch" agreement, however, was made "without prejudice" to the opposing claims of the parties in this dispute.


108
We have previously held that the McLouth-Jewell contract was an enforceable requirements contract under Michigan law.  We now add that the evidence concerning the needs of McLouth, as determined by its steelmaking processes in 1963, and the capability of Jewell, as determined at the same time, plus the evidence concerning how the parties themselves interpreted the contract in 1966 and 1968, necessitate the holding that the 26,643 average monthly tonnage found by the District Judge for 1966 is the maximum tonnage which, under Michigan law, is enforceable under this contract.

THE "CONTINGENCIES" CLAUSE

109
The District Judge found (and we agree) that the 1974 order of the Virginia Air Pollution Board (upon which appellant Jewell relies and which has been stayed pending this appeal) should not be regarded as excusing Jewell's performance of this contract because of the force majeure provisions contained therein.


110
The contract provision at issue reads as follows:


111
Contingencies: It is understood that Seller's failure to deliver, or Buyer's failure to accept, said coke in the event, and during the continuance, of any action by governmental authority (whether now or hereafter effective) preventing performance of this agreement in accordance with its terms, or failure to make or accept deliveries hereunder when due, if occasioned by act of God or the public enemy, fire, explosion, flood, war, riots, sabotage, strike, action of any governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises, or any circumstance beyond either party's reasonable control, shall not subject such party to any liability to the other party hereto.


112
Clearly to this date no final order by any "governmental authority having jurisdiction in the premises" has prevented Jewell's compliance with this contract.  Nor is there any certainty on this record that any governmental authority will in the future.

THE REMEDY

113
The District Judge found (and we agree) that the McLouth-Jewell contract did not contain any limitation of Jewell's supply of coke to McLouth to any particular plant.  Clearly Jewell did not construe the contract as limited to the Mitchell ovens.  It voluntarily and repeatedly shipped to McLouth from other of its coke plant facilities.


114
The District Judge's Declaratory Judgment presumably because it found this contract to be a requirements contract without any limit specifically orders Jewell to build new coke plant facilities in compliance with Virginia air pollution standards to replace the 210 Mitchell ovens or to purchase coke on the open market to fulfill this contract.


115
We see no need at this juncture to face all of the questions which this order would produce.  The court's Declaratory Judgment which we are affirming mandatorily enjoins Jewell and its officers and agents to continue to perform this contract.  We have now affirmed this judgment with a maximum which McLouth can demand under the contract of 26,643 tons per month.


116
We doubt that enforcement of this judgment as modified will prove to be a problem.  However, if it does, contempt proceedings and money damages should prove an adequate remedy.  Jewell surely is collectible.

DAMAGES

117
We also note the District Judge's extensive conclusions of law on past contract damage claims.  These claims have yet to be heard and we decline to review the legal conclusions submitted until the hearing record on damages is completed.

THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT

118
For the reasons stated above, the Declaratory Judgment is affirmed, but only to the extent set forth and as modified (see italics) below.  The balance of the Declaratory Judgment is vacated.  The Declaratory Judgment as modified is as follows:

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT (COUNT I)

119
Permanent Injunction Pursuant to Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law


120
(Entered August 28, 1975)


121
This cause came on to be heard for trial on the verified amended complaint of plaintiff McLouth Steel Corporation (McLouth), and the court having heard and considered oral and documentary evidence and having separately filed on May 1, 1975, its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law pursuant to 52 F.R.Civ.P. as to the issues of contract interpretation and liabilities under Count I of the Amended Complaint and the Amended Counter Claim herein;


122
Now, Therefore, It Adjudged and Decreed that:

DECLARATORY RELIEF

123
The 1961 Agreement (hereinafter the Agreement) is binding upon McLouth and defendants Jewell Coal and Coke Company and the present Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation, collectively referred to as "Jewell."


124
This Agreement between McLouth and Jewell is a requirements contract executed under the law of Michigan.  Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Jewell is obligated, upon reasonable advance notice from McLouth, to sell and McLouth is obligated to buy from Jewell until April 30, 1993, all of McLouth's requirements of blast furnace coke in excess of 59,000 tons per month, up to a maximum of 26,643 tons per month.  The Agreement neither expressly nor impliedly designates a specific battery of ovens nor any other specific asset of Jewell as the sole equipment from which Jewell is to fulfill McLouth's requirements.  Such blast furnace coke is to be of the quality specified in the Agreement and is to be sold under the terms of the Agreement pertaining to prices, escalation, duration, deliveries, weights, payments and contingencies.

PERMANENT INJUNCTION

125
Jewell shall, commencing on the date hereof and continuing through April 30, 1993, produce and sell to McLouth, and McLouth shall buy from Jewell all of McLouth's blast furnace coke requirements in excess of 59,000 tons per month, up to a maximum of 26,643 tons per month.  Such blast furnace coke is to be of the quality specified in the Agreement and it is to be sold under all of the terms of the Agreement pertaining to price, escalation, duration, deliveries, weights, payment and contingencies.


126
In the event that in any month Jewell shall be unable to perform its obligation as construed herein, McLouth shall have the right to obtain furnace coke from sources other than Jewell in sufficient quantity to make up the difference between the quantity shipped to McLouth in that month by Jewell and McLouth's requirements less 59,000 tons.  Any differential between the contract price and the delivered price paid for the coke purchased in accordance with this paragraph shall be adjusted between the parties in the following month by adding to or subtracting from the total payment to be made by McLouth to Jewell in that month.  McLouth shall make available for inspection by Jewell at McLouth's offices in Detroit, all invoices, freight bills, and shipping records relating to any such cover purchases.


127
In the event that Jewell asserts that the cost of compliance with its obligation to supply coke, as set forth herein, will cause an unconscionable burden upon it, Jewell shall be afforded an opportunity to introduce evidence to establish its costs to supply the coke required under the Agreement, Provided, However, that Jewell can first establish that it has in making such deliveries exhausted its entire production capacity from its existing facilities, and, Provided Further, that any additional coke which it supplied was in fact supplied by the least expensive means available.  If such cost for delivery, after compliance with these provisions, is so substantially disproportionate to the price then being paid under the Agreement as to create an unconscionable result, as asserted by Jewell, the court may adjust the price to be paid for such coke supplied to avoid such result.


128
During the remaining duration of the Agreement, the defendants, their directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys, and all other persons in active concert or active participation with them to whom knowledge of the order shall come shall absolutely desist and refrain from:


129
(a) Terminating, delaying, interrupting or otherwise failing the making of regular and timely sales to McLouth of the quantities of coke ordered by McLouth up to the maximum specified herein.


130
(b) In any way harassing, threatening and attempting to intimidate or economically coerce McLouth with respect to termination, delay or interruption of regular and timely deliveries of all coke required to be sold under the terms of the Agreement.


131
While we have already clearly implied rejection of appellant Jewell's remaining issues, we deal briefly with them below.

REMAINING ISSUES

132
We perceive no law or logic to support appellant Jewell's argument that the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board is a necessary party to this purely contractual dispute.


133
We find no merit to appellant's claim that this contract as interpreted above creates or tends to create any monopoly in the coke market.


134
The disposition we have indicated above also serves to moot appellant's contention that McLouth by this contract has violated the antitrust laws by "acquiring" Jewell.


135
We find no merit to appellant Jewell's contention that McLouth is barred from equitable relief by the fact that at times in the life of the instant contract it bought coke from other suppliers than Jewell.  The findings of fact of the District Judge on this issue are not clearly erroneous.


136
Further, the McLouth-Jewell contract guaranteed Jewell only 9,000 tons per month and did not exclude McLouth's purchases from others of coke which Jewell could not or did not supply.  Any claims that McLouth violated the contract to Jewell's damage by failing to order its actual requirements over 59,000 tons may be adjudicated in the hearing on damages.


137
The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.



*
 Honorable Alfonso J. Zirpoli, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation


1
 Jewell was originally Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation.  In 1970-1971, its name was changed to Jewell Coal and Coke Company and Jewell Smokeless Coal Corporation ("Smokeless") was formed.  Since then Jewell's business has been the production and sale of coke and Smokeless has held the coal leases, operated the coal cleaning and preparation equipment, and performed the coal sales


2
 Jewell also poured foundations for 44 other ovens for possible future expansion


3

Ramaco Resources, Inc. Announces Acquisition Of Southwestern Virginia Coal Properties






GlobeNewswire



Mar 29, 2017 5:00 PM EDT













 


















































 LEXINGTON, Ky., March 29, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RAMACO Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:METC) ("Ramaco") announced today that it has entered into various agreements acquiring, through its subsidiary RAMACO Resources Land Holdings, LLC, approximately 14,762 acres of coal properties in Tazewell and Buchanan Counties, Virginia and McDowell County, West Virginia, from Jewell Ridge Coal Corporation ("Jewell Ridge"), an indirect subsidiary of The Brink's Company.  As part of the transaction, Ramaco acquired several coal leaseholds adjacent to its Knox Creek operations. Among the assets acquired, Ramaco became the sublessor of Revelation Energy, LLC ("Revelation"), which now operates several underground coal mines formerly owned by a subsidiary of SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke"), and which still supply coal to SunCoke's nearby Jewell Coke Plant. However, Ramaco also acquired significant properties that are not subleased to Revelation in close proximity to Ramaco's Knox Creek preparation plant and Norfolk Southern loadout, which may be developed in the future. In addition to receiving royalty income from the acquired properties, Ramaco will immediately begin planning development of those portions of the properties not currently subleased to Revelation.  Ramaco's management estimates that the acquisition will yield approximately 10 million mineable tons of metallurgical coal once exploration and reserve analysis efforts are completed.  Ramaco intends to enter into additional subleases with neighboring coal operators as well as develop its own mid- and low-volatile metallurgical coal mines.  Ramaco will also explore the potential for re-mining two existing coal refuse areas which could contain saleable metallurgical-quality material which was a by-product of processing coal prior to the implementation of more modern coal processing technology. Michael Bauersachs, Ramaco's President and Chief Executive Officer, noted that "Ramaco's strong balance sheet was the key driver in completing this transaction.  We were able to provide proper assurance to both Jewell Ridge and our new lessors of our ability to perform in the future, which was critical given our posture as a relatively new coal producer.  This transaction meets our disciplined criteria of acquiring metallurgical coal reserves near existing operations at a low cost of entry."

(1)



Pursuant to
General Instruction II.D of Form S-3 and Rule 457(o) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities
Act ”), the registration fee is calculated on the
basis of the initial maximum aggregate offering price of
$500,000,000 for all of the securities listed and, therefore, the
table does not specify by each class information as to the amount
to be registered or the proposed maximum offering price per
security.





(2)



This
registration statement covers an indeterminate number or principal
amount of each identified class of securities that may be issued in
primary offerings, or upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any
securities registered hereunder that provide for exercise,
conversion or exchange, which shall have an initial maximum
aggregate offering price not to exceed $500,000,000, exclusive of
accrued interest and dividends, if any. Pursuant to Rule 416 under
the Securities Act, this registration statement also covers such
additional number of securities that may be issuable upon exercise,
conversion or exchange of other securities or that may become
issuable as a result of any stock splits, stock dividends or
similar transactions.





(3)



The
registration fee has been calculated in accordance with Rule 457(o)
under the Securities Act, and is exclusive of accrued interest and
dividends, if any.





(4)



With
respect to debt securities, excludes accrued interest and accrued
amortization of discount, if any, to the date of delivery. If any
debt securities are issued at an original issue discount, then the
offering price of such debt securities shall be equal to any such
greater principal amount due at maturity, such aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $500,000,000 less the value of any securities
previously issued hereunder.





(5)



Warrants
will represent rights to purchase the debt securities, common
stock, or preferred stock being registered hereby. Since the
warrants will provide a right only to purchase such securities
offered hereunder, no additional registration fee is
required.





(6)



Rights will
represent rights to purchase shares of common stock or shares of
preferred stock being registered hereby. Since the rights will
provide a right only to purchase such securities offered hereunder,
no additional registration fee is required.





(7)



Each unit
will be issued under a unit agreement and will represent an
interest in two or more other securities, which may or may not be
separable from one another.





(8)



If a series
of debt securities is guaranteed, such series will be guaranteed by
one or more of the subsidiaries of SunCoke Energy, Inc. No
additional consideration will be received for such guarantees.
Pursuant to Rule 457(n) of the Securities Act, no separate fee is
payable with respect to the guarantees of the debt securities being
registered.

  ABOUT
THIS PROSPECTUS

This
prospectus is part of a registration statement that we have filed
with the SEC using a “shelf” registration process.
Under this shelf process, we may sell different types of securities
described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. This
prospectus provides you with a general description of SunCoke
Energy, Inc. and the securities that are registered hereunder that
may be offered by us. This prospectus does not contain all of the
information that is in the registration statement. We omitted
certain parts of the registration statement from this prospectus as
permitted by the SEC. We refer you to the registration statement
and its exhibits for additional information about us and the
securities that may be sold under this prospectus.

Each time
we sell any securities offered by this prospectus, we will provide
a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information
about the terms of that offering and the securities being offered.
Any prospectus supplement also may add to, update or change
information contained in this prospectus. To the extent information
in this prospectus is inconsistent with the information contained
in a prospectus supplement, you should rely on the information in
the prospectus supplement.

The
information in this prospectus is accurate as of its date.
Additional information, including our financial statements and the
notes thereto, is incorporated in this prospectus by reference to
our reports filed with the SEC. Before you invest in our
securities, you should carefully read this prospectus, including
the information in the “Risk Factors” section, any
prospectus supplement, the information incorporated by reference in
this prospectus and any prospectus supplement (including the
documents described under the heading “Information We
Incorporate by Reference” in both this prospectus and
any prospectus supplement), and any additional information you may
need to make your investment decision. 

  WHERE
YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

We have
filed a registration statement with the SEC under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act
”), that registers the securities to be offered subsequently
by any prospectus supplement to this prospectus. The registration
statement, including the attached exhibits, contains additional
relevant information about us. In addition, we file annual,
quarterly and other reports, proxy statements and other information

  CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This
prospectus and any prospectus supplement and the documents we

operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive
position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating
performance, the effects of competition and the effects of future

forward-looking statements include known and unknown risks. These
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,
include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth under
“Risk Factors” and described in the documents

Historical data may not be reliable indicator of future results.
Except as may be required by applicable law, we undertake no

future events or otherwise.

  WHO
WE ARE

This
summary highlights important features of this offering and the
information included or incorporated by reference into this
prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information
that you should consider before investing in our securities. You
should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the risk
factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on
February 18, 2016 and is incorporated by reference herein, as
well as the risk factors and other information in any other
document incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the “
Company
,” “ we ,” “
our ,” “ us
,” or like terms refer to SunCoke Energy, Inc. and our
subsidiaries.

We are an
independent owner and operator of five cokemaking facilities in the
United States, the operator of a cokemaking facility in Brazil, and
owner of a joint venture interest in cokemaking operations in
India. We also provide coal handling and blending services to third
party customers as well as to our own cokemaking
facilities.

On
January 24, 2013, we completed the initial public offering of
SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., our master limited partnership (the
“ Partnership ”) subsidiary. Our
consolidated financial statements include the Partnership, which
currently owns all of our coal handling and blending operations,
and holds a 98 percent interest in each of our Gateway, Haverhill
and Middletown cokemaking operations. We currently own the general
partner of the Partnership (consisting of a 2.0 percent ownership
interest and incentive distribution rights), as well as a 56.1
percent limited partner interest in the Partnership. The remaining
41.9 percent interest in the Partnership is held by public
unitholders. We report our business results through the following
four business segments:

 




 



•



 



Domestic
Coke: consists
of our Jewell, Indiana Harbor, Haverhill, Granite City and
Middletown cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in
Vansant, Virginia; East Chicago, Indiana; Franklin Furnace, Ohio;
Granite City, Illinois; and Middletown, Ohio, respectively. Our
domestic cokemaking facilities have the collective nameplate
capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of coke per
year, and use a proprietary low-cost, heat-recovery cokemaking
technology that is environmentally superior to the chemical
by-product recovery technology currently used by most other coke
producers. Each of these facilities produces coke and all
facilities except Jewell and Indiana Harbor recover waste heat,
which is converted to steam or electricity through a similar
production process. Steam is sold to third party customers
primarily pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements.
Electricity is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel
pursuant to energy sales agreements. Coke sales at each of these
domestic cokemaking facilities are made pursuant to long-term
take-or-pay agreements with ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, and U.S.
Steel. Each of the coke sales agreements contains pass-through
provisions for costs incurred in the cokemaking process, including
coal procurement costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke
yields), operating and maintenance expense, costs related to the
transportation of coke to the customers, taxes (other than income
taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation, in addition
to containing a fixed fee.




 




 



•



 



Brazil
Coke: consists
of our operations in Vitória, Brazil, where we operate a
1.7 million tons-per year cokemaking facility for a project
company. The Brazil Coke segment earns income at this cokemaking
facility through (1) licensing and operating fees payable to
us under long-term contracts with the local project company that
will run through at least 2022; and (2) an annual preferred
dividend on our preferred stock investment from the project company
guaranteed by the Brazilian subsidiary of ArcelorMittal.




 




 



•



 



Coal
Logistics: consists
of coal handling and blending service operations owned and operated
through subsidiaries of the Partnership having the collective
capacity to blend and transload more than 40 million tons of
coal annually and has storage capacity of 3 million tons.
These operations are strategically located to reach Gulf Coast,
East Coast, Great Lakes and international ports, and are comprised
Raven Energy LLC, which owns Convent Marine Terminal, one of the
largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast, located in
Convent, Louisiana; Kanawha River Terminals, located in

Table of
Contents

 




 



Belle,
West Virginia and Catlettsburg, Kentucky; SunCoke Lake Terminal,
LLC, located in East Chicago, Indiana; and Ceredo Liquid Terminal
LLC, located in Ceredo, West Virginia. This business provides coal
handling and blending services to third party steel, electric
utility and coal mining customers, as well as to our own cokemaking
facilities.




 




 



•



 



Coal
Mining: historically
consisted of metallurgical coal mining operations near our Jewell
cokemaking facility, with mines located in Virginia and West
Virginia mined by contractors. On April 6, 2016, we
successfully disposed of substantially all of our coal mining
assets, mineral leases, real estate and a substantial portion of
our mining reclamation obligations to Revelation Energy, LLC
(“ Revelation ”). We retained certain
coal mining assets and liabilities, primarily coal inventory, which
continue to be included in the Coal Mining segment.




We also
own a 49 percent interest in a cokemaking joint venture with VISA
Steel, called VISA SunCoke. VISA SunCoke is comprised of a
440 thousand ton heat recovery cokemaking facility and the
facility’s associated steam generation units in Odisha,
India. In 2015 we impaired our 49 percent investment in VISA
SunCoke to zero, and consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2015, we no longer include our share of VISA SunCoke in our
financial results.

Our
principal executive offices are located at 1011 Warrenville Road,
Suite 600, Lisle, Illinois 60532, and our telephone number is
(630) 824-1000. Our website is located at

We have
computed the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing
earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings consists of
income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed
charges and amortization of capitalized interest, minus capitalized
interest and non-controlling interest in pre-tax income of
subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. Fixed charges
include interest expensed, amortization of capitalized expenses
related to indebtedness and estimates of interest within rental
expenses.

The ratio
of combined fixed charges and preference dividends for each of
these periods is the same as the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges, because we had no preferred securities outstanding during
the periods.

directors standing for election, if they should so
choose.

Liquidation
Rights. In the
event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of common stock are entitled

available for distribution, after payment of all debts and other
liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of
preferred stock then outstanding.




 




 



•



 



Preemptive
Rights. The
holders of our common stock do not have any preemptive right to
purchase our securities.




 




 



•



 



Conversion.
Shares of
our common stock are not convertible into shares of any other class
of capital stock.

registrar, transfer agent and cash dividend paying agent for our
common stock.




Preferred
Stock

Our board
of directors is authorized without further stockholder action to
provide for the issuance from time to time of preferred stock in
one or more series and to determine the designations, powers,
rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions
of the preferred stock of each such series, including, without
limitation, voting rights (if any), dividend rights, dissolution
rights, conversion rights, exchange rights and redemption rights
and such other provisions as may be determined by the board of
directors in accordance with Delaware law. The

issuance
of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with
possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among
other things, adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
our common stock.

We will
distribute a prospectus supplement with regard to each particular
series of preferred stock. Each prospectus supplement will describe
the designations, preferences, dividend rates, liquidation rights,
voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and such other
provisions determined by our board of directors to apply to the
particular series of preferred stock, including:

 




 



•



 



the
designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number,
letter or title;




 




 



•



 



the number
of shares of the series, which our board of directors may
thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the certificate of
designation applicable to the series) increase or decrease (but not
below the number of shares of the series then
outstanding);




 




 



•



 



the
amounts payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
series in respect of dividends, and whether such dividends, if any,
will be cumulative or noncumulative;




 




 



•



 



dates at
which dividends, if any, will be payable;




 




 



•



 



the
redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the
series;




 




 



•



 



the terms
and amount of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or
redemption of shares of the series;




 




 



•



 



the
amounts payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company;




 




 



•



 



whether
the shares of the series will be convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of
the Company or any other entity, and, if so, the specification of
such other class or series or such other security, the conversion
or exchange price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments
thereof, the date or dates at which such shares shall be
convertible or exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon
which such conversion or exchange may be made;




 




 



•



 



restrictions
on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other class
or series;




 




 



•



 



the voting
rights, if any, of the holders of shares of the series;
and




 




 



•



 



any other
rights and restrictions applicable to that series of preferred
stock.




The shares
of preferred stock will, when issued against full payment of their
purchase price, be fully paid and non-assessable. The following
description summarizes certain general terms and provisions of the
preferred stock, is not complete and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 




 



•



 



Ranking.
All shares
of the same series of preferred stock shall be identical in all
respects, except that each share of a series issued at different
times may differ as to the dates from which dividends on such
shares shall be cumulative. All series of preferred stock shall
rank equally with and be identical in all respects to each other
series, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our
preferred stock shall rank prior to our common stock as to
dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up.




 




 



•



 



Dividend
Rights. If you
purchase preferred stock being offered by use of this prospectus
and an applicable prospectus supplement, you will be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors,
dividends at the rates and on the dates set forth in the prospectus
supplement. Dividend rates may be fixed, variable or both. The
nature, amount, rates, timing and other details of dividend rights
for a series of preferred stock will be described in the applicable
prospectus supplement and will be payable in preference to, or in
such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or
classes or series of our stock, as described in the applicable
prospectus supplement.

Voting
Rights. The voting
rights of preferred stock of any series being offered will be
described in the applicable prospectus supplement.

Liquidation
Rights. In the
event that we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our affairs, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, holders of our preferred stock will
be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in the amount set
forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends, if any, before we make any distribution of assets
to the holders of our common stock or any other class of stock
ranking junior to our preferred stock. If we fail to pay in full
all amounts payable with respect to preferred stock being offered
by us and any stock having the same rank as that series of
preferred stock, the holders of the preferred stock and of that
other stock will share in any distribution of assets in proportion
to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are
entitled. After the holders of each series of preferred stock and
any stock having the same rank as the preferred stock are paid in
full, they will have no right or claim to any of our remaining
assets. For any series of preferred stock being offered by this
prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement, neither the
sale of all or substantially all of our property or business nor a
merger or consolidation by us with any other corporation will be
considered a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of our business
or affairs.

Redemption.
We may
redeem all or any part of any series of our preferred stock at the
times and redemption prices set forth in the resolutions adopted by
our board of directors providing for the issue of that series. In
the event of a partial redemption, the shares to be redeemed may be
selected by lot or by such other equitable method as our board of
directors in its discretion may determine. The terms, if any, on
which shares of a series of preferred stock being offered may be
redeemed will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
The preferred stock of a series may be redeemed in such amount or
amounts, and at such time or times, if any, as may be provided in
respect of that particular series of preferred stock. Preferred
stock may be redeemed by us only to the extent legally permissible.
Unless we default in making payment of the redemption price plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, upon redemption, the redeemed
preferred shares shall cease to be outstanding and the holders
thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares
and shall have no interest in or claim against us except the right
to receive the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
Conversion rights, if any, of preferred shares called for
redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the business
day prior to the redemption date.

Conversion
Rights. The
applicable prospectus supplement will state the terms, if any, on
which shares of a series of preferred stock being offered are
convertible into shares of our common stock or another series of
our preferred stock.




Annual
Stockholders Meeting

Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that annual stockholder
meetings will be held at a date, time and place, if any, as
exclusively selected by our board of directors. To the extent
permitted under applicable law, we may conduct meetings by remote
communications, including by webcast.

Voting

The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock
present, in person or by proxy, at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders and entitled to vote will decide all matters voted on
by stockholders, unless the question is one upon which, by express
provision of law, under our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, or under our amended and restated bylaws, a
different vote is required, in which case such provision will
control.

Anti-Takeover
Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws

The
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below
may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a
tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your
best interest, including an attempt that might result in

Table of
Contents

your
receipt of a premium over the market price for your shares. These
provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking
to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of
directors, which could result in an improvement of their
terms.

 




 



•



 



Special
Meetings of Stockholders. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,
subject to the requirements of applicable law and any special
rights of holders of preferred stock, a special meeting of
stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our board of
directors or by a resolution adopted by a majority of the number of
directors our Board of Directors would have if there were no
vacancies.




 




 



•



 



Stockholder
Action by Written Consent. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any
action that, under the DGCL, may be taken at any meeting of
stockholders may be taken in lieu of a meeting by written consent
of stockholders if the consent is signed by all of the persons who
would be entitled to vote upon such action at a meeting, or by
their duly authorized attorneys.




 




 



•



 



Removal of
Directors. Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of
the holders of any series of preferred stock, directors may be
removed with cause at any time upon the affirmative vote of holders
of at least 80 percent of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of voting stock, voting together as a single
class.




 




 



•



 



Stockholder
Advance Notice Procedure. Our
amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure
for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as
directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of
our stockholders. The amended and restated bylaws provide that any
stockholders wishing to nominate persons for election as directors
at, or bring other business before, an annual meeting must deliver
to our secretary a written notice of the stockholder’s
intention to do so. These provisions may have the effect of
precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the
proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions
also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a
solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of
directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our
company.




 




 



•



 



Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that it
may be amended by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our
board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock then
entitled to vote at any annual or special meeting of stockholders;
provided , however , that specified provisions of our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation may not be
amended, altered or repealed unless the amendment is approved by
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the
voting power of all of the voting stock, voting together as a
single class, including: the provisions governing the liability and
indemnification of directors; maintenance of certain insurance
coverage; and the requirement for supermajority approval of certain
amendments to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation.




In
addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that our amended
and restated bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed, or new
bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
board of directors, or by the affirmative vote at a meeting of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock; provided , however , that the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the
voting power of all of the voting stock, voting together as a
single class is required to alter, amend, repeal, or adopt
provisions relating to: the right to call a special meeting of
stockholders; advance notice of nominations or other business to be
properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders; required
vote and procedure for election of directors; setting of a record
date for stockholder action by consent; the number, tenure and
qualification of directors; the removal of directors and filling of
vacancies on the Board of Directors; indemnification of directors
and officers; and amendment of our amended and restated
bylaws.

These
provisions make it more difficult for any person to remove or amend
any provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that may have an
anti-takeover effect.

Table of
Contents

In
addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits certain
transactions between us and a stockholder who beneficially owns
(together with any affiliates or associates) at least 15 percent of
our outstanding voting shares. This provision could prevent certain
business combinations between such an interested stockholder and us
for a period of up to three years. In addition, our amended and
restated bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes of
directors serving staggered, three-year terms. Vacancies and
newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the size
of our board may be filled by our board until the next election of
the class for which such director shall have been chosen, even if
the directors then on the board do not constitute a quorum. Members
of our board of directors may only be removed from office by our
stockholders for cause. These provisions could delay or prevent a
change in control or removal of existing management.

Limitations
on Liability

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains
provisions permitted under the DGCL relating to the liability of
directors. These provisions eliminate a director’s personal
liability for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary
duty, except in circumstances involving: a breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty; acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of the law; Section 174 of the DGCL, pertaining to
unlawful dividends; or a transaction from which the director
derives an improper personal benefit. The principal effect of the
limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be
unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a
director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for
liability for which indemnification is not available under the
DGCL. These provisions, however, should not limit or eliminate our
rights or a stockholder’s right to seek non-monetary relief,
such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of
fiduciary duty by directors. These provisions do not alter a
director’s liability under federal securities laws. The
inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management
from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their
fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might
otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. 

Indemnification

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to
indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the
fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL and other applicable law,
except in the case of a proceeding instituted by the director or
officer without the approval of our board of directors. Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we are
required to indemnify our directors and executive officers, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, for all judgments, fines,
settlements, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection
with pending or threatened legal proceedings because of the
director’s or officer’s positions with us or another
entity that the director or officer serves at our request, subject
to various conditions, and to advance funds to our directors and
officers to enable them to defend against such
proceedings.

We have
entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our
directors. The indemnification agreements provide our directors
with contractual rights to the indemnification and expense
advancement rights provided under our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, as well as contractual rights to
additional indemnification as provided in the indemnification
agreement.

Exclusive
Forum for Adjudication of Disputes

Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our
stockholders by any of our directors, officers or employees; any
action asserting a claim against us, or any of our directors or
officers, arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting
a claim against us, or any of our directors or officers, that is
governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We may consent in
writing to alternative forums. By becoming a stockholder in our
company, you will be deemed to have notice of, and have consented
to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation related to choice of forum.

  DESCRIPTION
OF THE DEBT SECURITIES

The Debt
Securities will be either our senior debt securities (“
Senior Debt Securities ”) or our subordinated
debt securities (“ Subordinated Debt Securities
”). The Senior Debt Securities and the Subordinated Debt
Securities will be issued under separate indentures among us, the
Subsidiary Guarantors of such Debt Securities, if any, and a
trustee to be determined (the “ Trustee
”). Senior Debt Securities will be issued under a “
Senior Indenture ” and Subordinated Debt
Securities will be issued under a “ Subordinated
Indenture .” Together, the Senior Indenture and the
Subordinated Indenture are called “ Indentures
.”

The Debt
Securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
The particular terms of each series that are offered by a
prospectus supplement will be described in the prospectus
supplement.

Unless the
Debt Securities are guaranteed by our subsidiaries as described
below, the rights of the Company and our creditors, including
holders of the Debt Securities, to participate in the assets of any
subsidiary upon the latter’s liquidation or reorganization,
will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s
creditors, except to the extent that we may ourself be a creditor
with recognized claims against such subsidiary.

We have
summarized selected provisions of the Indentures below. The summary
is not complete. The form of each Indenture has been filed with the
SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part, and you should read the Indentures for
provisions that may be important to you. Capitalized terms used in
the summary have the meanings specified in the
Indentures.

General

The
Indentures provide that Debt Securities in separate series may be
issued thereunder from time to time without limitation as to
aggregate principal amount. We may specify a maximum aggregate
principal amount for the Debt Securities of any series. We will
determine the terms and conditions of the Debt Securities,
including the maturity, principal and interest, but those terms
must be consistent with the Indenture. The Debt Securities will be
our unsecured obligations.

The
Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all of our Senior Debt (as
defined) as described under “— Subordination of
Subordinated Debt Securities” and in the prospectus
supplement applicable to any Subordinated Debt Securities. If the
prospectus supplement so indicates, the Debt Securities will be
convertible into our common stock.

If
specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a particular
series of Debt Securities, one or more Subsidiary Guarantors
identified therein, will fully and unconditionally guarantee (the
“ Subsidiary Guarantee ”) that series as
described under “— Subsidiary Guarantee” and in
the prospectus supplement. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be an
unsecured obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor. A Subsidiary
Guarantee of Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated to
the Senior Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantor on the same basis as
the Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinated to our Senior
Debt.

The
applicable prospectus supplement will set forth the initial price
or prices at which the Debt Securities to be issued will be offered
for sale and will describe the following terms of such Debt
Securities:

(1) the
title of the Debt Securities;

(2)
whether the Debt Securities are Senior Debt Securities or
Subordinated Debt Securities and, if Subordinated Debt Securities,
the related subordination terms;

(3)
whether any Subsidiary Guarantor will provide a Subsidiary
Guarantee of the Debt Securities;

(4) any
limit on the aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Securities;

 

12


 


 


Table of
Contents

(5) each
date on which the principal of the Debt Securities will be
payable;

(6) the
interest rate that the Debt Securities will bear and the interest
payment dates for the Debt Securities;

(7) each
place where payments on the Debt Securities will be
payable;

(8) any
terms upon which the Debt Securities may be redeemed, in whole or
in part, at our option;

(9) any
sinking fund or other provisions that would obligate us to redeem
or otherwise repurchase the Debt Securities;

(10) the
portion of the principal amount, if less than all, of the Debt
Securities that will be payable upon declaration of acceleration of
the Maturity of the Debt Securities;

(11)
whether the Debt Securities are defeasible;

(12) any
addition to or change in the Events of Default;

(13)
whether the Debt Securities are convertible into our common stock
and, if so, the terms and conditions upon which conversion will be
effected, including the initial conversion price or conversion rate
and any adjustments thereto and the conversion period;

(14) any
addition to or change in the covenants in the Indenture applicable
to the Debt Securities; and

(15) any
other terms of the Debt Securities not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Indenture.

Debt
Securities, including any Debt Securities that provide for an
amount less than the principal amount thereof to be due and payable
upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof (“
Original Issue Discount Securities ”), may be
sold at a substantial discount below their principal amount.
Special U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to Debt
Securities sold at an original issue discount may be described in
the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition, special U.S.
federal income tax or other considerations applicable to any Debt
Securities that are denominated in a currency or currency unit
other than U.S. dollars may be described in the applicable
prospectus supplement.

Subordination
of Subordinated Debt Securities

The
indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Debt Securities will, to
the extent set forth in the Subordinated Indenture with respect to
each series of Subordinated Debt Securities, be subordinate in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of all of our Senior
Debt, including the Senior Debt Securities, and it may also be
senior in right of payment to all of our Subordinated Debt. The
prospectus supplement relating to any Subordinated Debt Securities
will summarize the subordination provisions of the Subordinated
Indenture applicable to that series including:

 




 



•



 



the
applicability and effect of such provisions upon any payment or
distribution respecting that series following any liquidation,
dissolution or other winding-up, or any assignment for the benefit
of creditors or other marshalling of assets or any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings;




 




 



•



 



the
applicability and effect of such provisions in the event of
specified defaults with respect to any Senior Debt, including the
circumstances under which and the periods during which we will be
prohibited from making payments on the Subordinated Debt
Securities; and




 




 



•



 



the
definition of Senior Debt applicable to the Subordinated Debt
Securities of that series and, if the series is issued on a senior
subordinated basis, the definition of Subordinated Debt applicable
to that series.




 

13


 


 


Table of
Contents

The
prospectus supplement will also describe as of a recent date the
approximate amount of Senior Debt to which the Subordinated Debt
Securities of that series will be subordinated.

The
failure to make any payment on any of the Subordinated Debt
Securities by reason of the subordination provisions of the
Subordinated Indenture described in the prospectus supplement will
not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of
Default with respect to the Subordinated Debt Securities arising
from any such failure to make payment.

The
subordination provisions described above will not be applicable to
payments in respect of the Subordinated Debt Securities from a
defeasance trust established in connection with any legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Subordinated Debt
Securities as described under “— Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance.”

Subsidiary
Guarantee

If
specified in the prospectus supplement, one or more Subsidiary
Guarantors will guarantee the Debt Securities of a series. Unless
otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the following
provisions will apply to the Subsidiary Guarantee of each
Subsidiary Guarantor.

Subject to
the limitations described below and in the prospectus supplement,
the Subsidiary Guarantors will jointly and severally, fully and
unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment when due, whether at
Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all our payment
obligations under the Indentures and the Debt Securities of a
series, whether for principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the Debt Securities or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed
by a Subsidiary Guarantor being herein called the “
Guaranteed Obligations ”). The Subsidiary
Guarantors will also pay all expenses (including reasonable counsel
fees and expenses) incurred by the applicable Trustee in enforcing
any rights under a Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to a
Subsidiary Guarantor.

In the
case of Subordinated Debt Securities, a Subsidiary
Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor on
the same basis as the Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinated
to our Senior Debt. No payment will be made by any Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee during any period in which
payments by us on the Subordinated Debt Securities are suspended by
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated
Indenture.

Each
Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Subsidiary
Guarantor without rendering such Subsidiary Guarantee voidable
under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

Each
Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and
will:

(1) remain
in full force and effect until either (a) payment in full of
all the applicable Debt Securities (or such Debt Securities are
otherwise satisfied and discharged in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Indenture) or (b) released as
described in the following paragraph;

(2) be
binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(3) inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the applicable Trustee, the
Holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

In the
event that (a) a Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a
Subsidiary, (b) either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance
occurs with respect to the series or (c) all or substantially
all of the assets or all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
Guarantor is sold, including by way of sale, merger, consolidation
or otherwise, such Subsidiary Guarantor will be released and
discharged of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee
and

the
Indenture without any further action required on the part of the
Trustee or any Holder, and no other Person acquiring or owning the
assets or Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor will be
required to enter into a Subsidiary Guarantee. In addition, the
prospectus supplement may specify additional circumstances under
which a Subsidiary Guarantor can be released from its Subsidiary
Guarantee.

Form,
Exchange and Transfer

The Debt
Securities of each series will be issuable only in fully registered
form, without coupons, and, unless otherwise specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement, only in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof.

At the
option of the Holder, subject to the terms of the applicable
Indenture and the limitations applicable to Global Securities, Debt
Securities of each series will be exchangeable for other Debt
Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination and of
a like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

Subject to
the terms of the applicable Indenture and the limitations
applicable to Global Securities, Debt Securities may be presented
for exchange as provided above or for registration of transfer
(duly endorsed or with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly
executed) at the office of the Security Registrar or at the office
of any transfer agent designated by us for such purpose. No service
charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Debt Securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in that
connection. Such transfer or exchange will be effected upon the
Security Registrar or such transfer agent, as the case may be,
being satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the
Person making the request. The Security Registrar and any other
transfer agent initially designated by us for any Debt Securities
will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We may at
any time designate additional transfer agents or rescind the
designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office
through which any transfer agent acts, except that we will be
required to maintain a transfer agent in each Place of Payment for
the Debt Securities of each series.

If the
Debt Securities of any series (or of any series and specified
tenor) are to be redeemed in part, we will not be required to
(1) issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Debt
Security of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as
the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of
redemption of any such Debt Security that may be selected for
redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such
mailing or (2) register the transfer of or exchange any Debt
Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except
the unredeemed portion of any such Debt Security being redeemed in
part.

Global
Securities

Some or
all of the Debt Securities of any series may be represented, in
whole or in part, by one or more Global Securities that will have
an aggregate principal amount equal to that of the Debt Securities
they represent. Each Global Security will be registered in the name
of a Depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable
prospectus supplement, will be deposited with such Depositary or
nominee or its custodian and will bear a legend regarding the
restrictions on exchanges and registration of transfer thereof
referred to below and any such other matters as may be provided for
pursuant to the applicable Indenture.

Notwithstanding
any provision of the Indentures or any Debt Security described in
this prospectus, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in
part for Debt Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global
Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any
Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or any
nominee of such Depositary unless:

(1) the
Depositary has notified us that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be
qualified to act as such as required by the applicable Indenture,
and in either case we fail to appoint a successor Depositary within
90 days;

(2) an
Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities represented by
such Global Security has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee
has received a written request from the Depositary to issue
certificated Debt Securities;

(3)
subject to the rules of the Depositary, we shall have elected to
terminate the book-entry system through the Depositary;
or

(4) other
circumstances exist, in addition to or in lieu of those described
above, as may be described in the applicable prospectus
supplement.

All
certificated Debt Securities issued in exchange for a Global
Security or any portion thereof will be registered in such names as
the Depositary may direct.

As long as
the Depositary, or its nominee, is the registered holder of a
Global Security, the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may
be, will be considered the sole owner and Holder of such Global
Security and the Debt Securities that it represents for all
purposes under the Debt Securities and the applicable Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances referred to above, owners of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to
have such Global Security or any Debt Securities that it represents
registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to
receive physical delivery of certificated Debt Securities in
exchange for those interests and will not be considered to be the
owners or Holders of such Global Security or any Debt Securities
that is represents for any purpose under the Debt Securities or the
applicable Indenture. All payments on a Global Security will be
made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the
Holder of the security. The laws of some jurisdictions may require
that some purchasers of Debt Securities take physical delivery of
such Debt Securities in certificated form. These laws may impair
the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global
Security.

Ownership
of beneficial interests in a Global Security will be limited to
institutions that have accounts with the Depositary or its nominee
(“ participants ”) and to Persons that
may hold beneficial interests through participants. In connection
with the issuance of any Global Security, the Depositary will
credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the
respective principal amounts of Debt Securities represented by the
Global Security to the accounts of its participants. Ownership of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will be shown only on,
and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only
through, records maintained by the Depositary (with respect to
participants’ interests) or any such participant (with
respect to interests of Persons held by such participants on their
behalf). Payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating
to beneficial interests in a Global Security may be subject to
various policies and procedures adopted by the Depositary from time
to time. None of us, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustees or the
agents of us, the Subsidiary Guarantors or the Trustees will have
any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
Depositary’s or any participant’s records relating to,
or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a
Global Security, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial interests.

Payment
and Paying Agents

Unless
otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement,
payment of interest on a Debt Security on any Interest Payment Date
will be made to the Person in whose name such Debt Security (or one
or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.

Unless
otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement,
principal of and any premium and interest on the Debt Securities of
a particular series will be payable at the office of such Paying
Agent or Paying Agents as we may designate for such purpose from
time to time, except that at our option payment of any interest on
Debt Securities in certificated form may be made by check mailed to
the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears
in the Security Register. Unless otherwise indicated in the
applicable prospectus supplement, the corporate trust office of the
Trustee under the Senior Indenture in The City of New York will
be

designated
as sole Paying Agent for payments with respect to Senior Debt
Securities of each series, and the corporate trust office of the
Trustee under the Subordinated Indenture in The City of New York
will be designated as the sole Paying Agent for payment with
respect to Subordinated Debt Securities of each series. Any other
Paying Agents initially designated by us for the Debt Securities of
a particular series will be named in the applicable prospectus
supplement. We may at any time designate additional Paying Agents
or rescind the designation of any Paying Agent or approve a change
in the office through which any Paying Agent acts, except that we
will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in each Place of
Payment for the Debt Securities of a particular series.

All money
paid by us to a Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of or
any premium or interest on any Debt Security which remains
unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, premium or
interest has become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the
Holder of such Debt Security thereafter may look only to us for
payment.

Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets

Unless
otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, we may not
consolidate with or merge into, or transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, any Person (a
“ successor Person ”), and may not permit
any Person to consolidate with or merge into us, unless:

(1) the
successor Person (if not us) is a corporation, partnership, trust
or other entity organized and validly existing under the laws of
any domestic jurisdiction and assumes our obligations on the Debt
Securities and under the Indentures;

(2)
immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to the
transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, has
occurred and is continuing; and

(3)
several other conditions, including any additional conditions with
respect to any particular Debt Securities specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement, are met.

The
successor Person (if not us) will be substituted for us under the
applicable Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an
original party to such Indenture, and, except in the case of a
lease, we will be relieved from any further obligations under such
Indenture and the Debt Securities.

Events of
Default

Unless
otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, each of the
following will constitute an Event of Default under the applicable
Indenture with respec
