For over forty years, Greenblock has provided high performance building envelope solutions to the residential and commercial construction industry. Known as "The Original ICF", Greenblock has a proven track record and a history of exceptional design, quality and service.
A Greenblock wall consists of 4”-12” of reinforced concrete, sandwiched between over 5 1/2” of insulating industrialstrength foam. As a result, the Greenblock building envelope provides occupants with a safe, clean, healthy and comfortable environment in which to live and work.
Structures built with Greenblock provide significant reduction in utility costs throughout its useful life by requiring less energy to heat and cool than structures built with conventional materials. The reinforced concrete walls can withstand Mother Nature’s fury. Moisture does not penetrate making the building virtually mold free. In short, a Greenblock building is stronger, healthier and cheaper to maintain.
With an extensive ICF product line and an expansive manufacturing network, Greenblock is the solution for your next building project.
