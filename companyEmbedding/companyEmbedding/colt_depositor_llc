About Colt Pistols










Colt pistols have long represented the gold standard in magazine-fed semi-automatic handguns.
Modern semi-automatic pistols all trace their roots to the famed Colt M1911 pistol, designed by John Browning and the standard-issue U.S. military sidearm from 1911 to 1985. Colt 1911 pistols and their descendants were in the hands of confident World War I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam-era servicemen. Colt customers today can purchase reproductions of these weapons, each faithfully manufactured to the original specifications from factory blueprints.
Despite Colt’s storied history, we know that our legacy for the 21st Century will rest on our continuing responsiveness to customer needs and the same inventiveness, innovation and commitment to quality and excellence that made Colt firearms famous 150 years ago. Accordingly, while we continue to offer classic model Colt pistols, we are proud to offer new pistol models designed to meet all the needs and to exceed the highest expectations of the most demanding customers.

About Colt Rifles










Colt rifle customers want the genuine article. They know that the story of today’s Colt commercial and sporting rifles began with the Stoner AR-15® design that Colt transformed into a military-grade rifle -- the Colt M16 automatic rifle. First deployed in the early days of the Vietnam War, the M16 followed in the footsteps of its Colt ancestors, establishing the quality, reliability and performance benchmarks by which all tactical military rifles have since been measured.
Nearly half a century has elapsed since the United States Government first fielded the Colt M16. Since that time Colt has never surrendered its position as manufacturer of the world’s preeminent combat rifles. During the War on Terror that followed September 11, 2001, American troops have increasingly been outfitted with the Colt M4 carbine, successor to the Colt M16 and proud bearer of the American and Colt military tradition.
Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

About Colt Revolvers










The Colt legend dates to 1836, when the United States Government issued Sam Colt a patent for the world’s first commercially viable revolving cylinder firearm. Since that time no firearm has been more intimately associated with the Colt name and story than the revolver.
From Sam Colt’s original revolver, to the Walker Colt made famous during the Mexican War, to the 1873 Single Action Army®, to the modern day classic Colt Python®, Colt has defined the standard of excellence that others strive to match.
No Colt revolver has earned greater acclaim than the 1873 Single Action Army revolving cylinder firearm (SAA). SAA owners have included the most famous and infamous of America’s frontier past: Theodore Roosevelt, Buffalo Bill Cody, Wyatt Earp, Pat Garrett, Billy the Kid, and countless others who, with the support of Colt revolvers, created the American West of history and legend.
Colt’s Manufacturing Company is proud to offer the 1873 Single Action Army revolving cylinder firearm in an array of calibers, barrel lengths and styles that will appeal to every enthusiast of heirloom quality handguns.

Colt Firearms










The story of Colt® firearms is written indelibly across the pages of history. The Colt legacy consists of more than four hundred distinct models of handguns and longarms, together with thousands of variations and subtypes, including such renowned guns as:




Richly gold inlaid and engraved, the "Last Colt Made in Hartford" Single Action Army was selected by coauthors Robert M. Lee and R.L. Wilson to be featured as the front cover gun for Volume II of their landmark publication, Magnificent Colts Selections from the Robert M. Lee Collection. This 600-page work celebrates the 175th Anniversary of Colt with the most elaborate firearms book ever published. Preface to the 14- x 11-inch tome was written by Donald E. Zilkha, Chairman, Colt's Manufacturing Co., Inc.




The Walker and Dragoon Percussion black powder models, the 1860 Army and 1861 Navy.
The 1873 Single Action Army® (or Peacemaker®), the most famous revolver ever, that heralded Colt’s move into the metallic-cartridge era. 
The Model 1911 Automatic Pistol that still defines the standard for modern day .45 semiautomatic pistols. 
The Python®, often referred to as the Rolls Royce of double action revolvers. 

Suffice it to say that no other name has contributed more to the history of American firearms than Colt. That’s what makes Colt the most revered and collectible name in the history of firearms to this very day.
The legendary company founded by Sam Colt in 1847 continues to produce the world’s most prized firearms, just minutes away from Colt’s original armory. The commitment to quality and excellence that made the Colt name world famous reveals itself in every revolver, pistol and rifle that leaves the Colt factory today. Colt commercial and sporting rifles are made to the same exacting standards as the Colt M4 Carbines that Colt Defense LLC produces for the U.S. Armed Forces and military customers throughout the world. Colt revolvers and pistols continue to be expertly machined from custom-forged blanks, hand-polished with proprietary tools and precisely assembled by highly skilled craftsmen and craftswomen. At every step in the manufacturing process, our guns are subjected to the most rigorous quality standards in the industry, assuring that every Colt firearm that leaves the factory today lives up to the proud tradition represented by the Colt name.
GET A LEGEND, GET A COLT.

About Black Rifle, LLC
Black Rifle opened its doors in November of 2008. We started out as a store that primarily focused on CMMG rifles, but soon started carrying more tactical, hunting, and self-defense firearms. With the endless support of our customers and community, we continue to grow. By June of 2013 we had to move to a new bigger location on the north side of the Parkade Center in Columbia, Missouri. With a full line of Firearms, Ammo, Accessories, and more, we look forward to providing our community and customers with quality service and products for years to come!

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
