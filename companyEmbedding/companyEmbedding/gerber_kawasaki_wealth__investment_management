Life Insurance


The life insurance process can be very confusing, yet it is an integral part of your overall financial plan. Due to the fact many life insurance companies have their own sales agents, it is difficult to truly compare which policy is best for you.
As independent financial advisors who specialize in life insurance planning, we offer a comprehensive review of your situation and provide you with objective solutions to meet your family needs. We hold your hand through every step of the insurance process from choosing a life insurance company, picking an affordable premium and benefit, deciding which type of policy is best suited for you. Contact us for a complimentary consultation with one of our advisors.


Have questions about protecting your family?
Speak to an Advisor


Try our Insurance Calculator to find out how much life insurance you need.





How much Life Insurance do I need?
This question is unique to each family. We determine the amount of insurance each family needs based off many factors including your current income, liabilities and the number of children you have. We know that cost is one of the most important factors in picking a life insurance policy and benefit amount. With that in mind, we will customize a plan that will not only fit into your budget, but also provide the benefit you need to protect your family.


What type of Life Insurance should I get?
Navigating through a sea of insurance policies and the agents that come with them is a daunting task. Let us simplify the process and explain to you exactly what you need to know. There are two main types of life insurance: temporary, or term, insurance and permanent insurance. We will help you choose the policy that is right for you.

Gerber Kawasaki | Business Owners

Business Owners


Business owners have many challenges in building a sustainable and successful business. Oftentimes business owners don't have the time or inclination to try to understand retirement and employee benefits. We are well versed in the different tools and retirement plans you can use to potentially build your wealth, lower your taxes, help protect your business as well as build employee loyalty. A Gerber Kawasaki advisor can help you implement a well rounded strategy to help protect and grow your business while maximizing your tax and financial benefits.


Questions about your business?
Speak to an Advisor







Retirement plans and employee benefits

Whether you are a family owned small business, a startup or an established corporation, offering competitive benefits is often the key to attracting and retaining good employees. It is also a great way to build your wealth, save on taxes and protect your assets. As a business owner, you want to develop a benefits strategy that fits you and your employees' needs.


At Gerber Kawasaki, we can help you craft and implement your benefits strategy. We are experienced in setting up and managing your retirement and health plans to help maximize the benefits while minimizing the costs.



Business insurance and protection
A critical aspect of building your business is protecting it with insurance. We specialize in key man insurance and risk assessment. There are many approaches to dealing with the risks that business owners face and we will craft an overall insurance plan that will deal with your unique needs. Our advisors can help determine the types of insurances you need and help you develop a protection plan in the event of a disruption, such as the departure or disability of an owner or key employee.


Business succession planning
Someday you may want to sell your business or pass it on to a family member, employee or another organization. Business Succession Planning is essential for anyone who owns a small business because typically the business is the largest asset in the owner’s estate. Without proper business succession planning, it’s unlikely that your business will survive to the next generation or sell for its true value. We can help you develop a detailed succession plan that meets your business and personal needs.
As a business owner, your personal life and business life are practically inseparable. That’s why it’s important for your personal financial planning to take into account the unique considerations and opportunities of owning and operating a business. Our advisors can help you seamlessly manage both aspects of your life and find the most adequate tools to help maximize your benefits and address your needs.

Our Story

      supports HTML5 video





A new generation of financial advisors
In the wake of the financial crisis, many brand-name financial institutions had destroyed the trust and squandered the savings of millions of Americans.  In 2010, it was clear to Ross Gerber and Danilo Kawasaki, industry veterans and long time friends, that a new paradigm for wealth and investment management was not only needed, but that they were the people to do it.
Headquartered in Santa Monica, CA, and with over $585 Million in assets under management, Gerber Kawasaki is an independent investment advisor committed to building long-standing relationships throughout every phase in a clients' life.





We have an investment Program for you
Unlike many advisors and managers who only seek out the high net worth investor, Gerber Kawasaki offers two financial planning programs, wealth building and wealth management.  Wealth building is most often geared at younger individuals and their families, aged 25-45, who are seeking advice and investments which will grow their wealth and help them pursue their unique investment goals. Wealth Management is aimed at more affluent clients and investors.  The firm serves more than 4000 families across the country.
A new model for how investment companies conduct business.
The firm has a mobile app available on all iOS devices that enables its clients access to their financial plan, news, customized portfolios and advisor team, 24/7, from their laptop, phone or tablet.  The firm has an advanced technology platform and utilizes social media to enhance the client experience.  Serving a large, national clientele, the firms' highly mobile financial advisors conduct a constant dialogue with over 30,000 Facebook friends and 30,000 Twitter followers, and meet often with our national clients and family via Skype/Facetime.
We are the opinion and news makers of our industry
Our CEO Ross Gerber is a frequent guest on CNN, Bloomberg TV, CNBC, Fox Business News, and Reuters, as well as a contributing writer for Forbes.com.  Publications such as The New York Times, The LA Times, The Wall Street Journal, Wealth Management, RIA Biz, Financial Planning, Reuters, Yahoo! Finance and many others have sought out the founders of Gerber Kawasaki, not only for their investment acumen and market insight, but to profile the unique experience and level of innovation this company offers the families it works with.







Diversity is our Strength
Gerber Kawasaki believes that diversity is one of our strengths. Being based in Los Angeles, one of the most diverse cities in the world, we believe that to effectively serve the community, we must represent it. We know that many of our clients feel more comfortable communicating in their first language, expecially when it comes to discussing money. Feel free to contact us to review your financial situation in your home language. The following representatives fluently speak these languages:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
