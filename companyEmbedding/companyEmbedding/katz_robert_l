Robert L. Katz







Social psychologist Robert L. Katz in 1974, in his article,” Skills of an Effective Administrator“ in Harvard Business thought about the relationship of managerial skills (competences) and hierarchical management levels. The result was the setting of the three areas of managerial skills and determination, for which level they are characterized:

Technical skills - competencies important, particularly for lower management
Human skills - competencies needed for all levels of management
Conceptual skills - competencies with a substantial importance, particularly for top management

A similar method of determining managerial skills is defined as the eye of competencies ICB (IPMA Competence Baseline) in the standard of project management competencies. Relationship of individual skills for hierarchical level of management is illustrated in a figure:

Based upon my readings and use of this text book for both academic and later business research, I strongly believe that this structurally detailed, powerful and insightful book is a required core, basic studies reading for High School, College, University, Graduate Students and Post Graduate Studies.The Key Stone to this book is the concept of the Ying, Yang, the polarized interaction,interrelationship(s) of both the Formal and the Informal Organizations within both Public and Private Economy Sector Organizations."The formal Goals of the Formal Organization are not necessarily those of the Informal Organization and vice a versa."This landmark research work by Katz & Kahan, greatly enhances, sensitizes and helps the reader to conceptually organize, catalogue organizations and individuals by both types of organizational hierarchy and types of individuals' characterietics, so that we may more easily deal with both Formal and Informal Organizations and Individuals in a smoother, more rational, less emotional manner.I teach an Executive Project Managment course in both the Public and Private sectors of the Economy. When teaching Project Management to the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NAVSEA, I have always recommended the supplemental research use of The Social Psychology of Organizations by Daniel Kats, Robert Louis Kahn, as I do when teaching and consulting within the private sector of the economy.Katz & Kahan's, The Social Psychology of Organizations, provides the reader with a rich, detailed, structured framework,indeed a structured compartmentalized baseline, against which we can compare multiple types of diversified organizations and multiple types of diversified individuals, as we meet them throughout the lifetime course our public and private lives.Since a corporation is indeed a Formal Organization, and the corporation is a "Living Entity", then this work allows the reader to understand the diversified (sometimes disfunctional) personalities of the Formal Organization vs. the Informal Organization, corporate culture as they relate to us as the individual having to work and live wihtin their corporate contexts, paramaters and according to their unique set of corporate cultural rules and their respective formal and informal regulations.From a Psychological perspective, The Social Psychology of Organizations by Katz & Kahan, both fore-warns and fore-arms individuals vis a vis their interactions and inter-relationships with, within large corporations, large social structures and one on one with individuals.What a true treasure-trove of organizational knowledge, behavior, insights this organizational research really is. This is a timeless piece of organizational research work, as relevent today in 2002, as it was in 1968, 1973 and will be in 2013 and on.Thank you for the opportunity to review thie fine piece of work.Read more0Comment|

Proven to be a primary resource for my doctoral dissertation.  Katz and Kahn provide a precedential resource on the attributes of leadership, impacts of external causal factors on development and health, and key organizational theories which form the foundation on my study.  Discussion of open system theory is of particular importance to my research in the area of leadership attributes, development, influences of stress, and the requirements to sustain well-being.Read more0Comment|

Katz was involved in a criminal-libel issued by the Pacelli family in Italy over the contents of his book Death in Rome, in which he was charged with "defaming the memory of the Pope" Pius XII regarding the Ardeatine Massacre of 335 Italians, including 70 Jews, at the Ardeatine Caves in 1944. The case ended with the charges being ruled inconclusive,[5] although this was regarded as a defeat for Katz and he remained bitter over it until the end of his life.[6] The book was made into the 1973 film Massacre in Rome.
Katz lived for many years in Tuscany, Italy. He died October 20, 2010, in Montevarchi, Italy, as a result of complications from cancer surgery.[7]

The three management skills that mentioned by Robert Katz are conceptual, interpersonal and technical skills. In order to be a successful manager, containing these three skills will give him a strong impact to his career and also the success of the organization. Conceptual skills are skills that utilize the ability of a human to form concepts. Such skills include thinking creatively, formulating abstractions, analyzing complex situations, and solving problems. A manager have such ability can understand the organization as a whole and develop creative strategies. He is also able to examine a complex issue and formulate specific, effective courses of action.  Examples of situations that require conceptual skills include the passage of laws that affect hiring patterns in an organization, a competitor’s change in marketing strategy, or the reorganization of one department which ultimately affects the activities of other departments in the organization. Interpersonal skills involve the ability to work with, motivate, and direct individuals or groups in the organization whether they are subordinates, peers, or superiors. For a manager, interpersonal skills relate to the interacting of the manager with others in the way to enhance the successful of completion of the task. In order to display such ability, the manager required effective communication (in both speaking and writing), creation of the work setting, positive attitude maintenance, development of cooperation among group members and motivate the other members as a leader.  Beside the communication within an organization, how success a manager communicate with the other organization is also very important. For example, the manager maybe required to represent the organization to those outside the company. Thus, the manager acts as a liaison of the organization.  Technical skill involves process or technique knowledge and proficiency. Managers use the processes, techniques and tools of a specific area. Technical...

...identified a range of views on what constitutes a management and the different roles of managers. However, the most significant objective of management is the process by which the efforts of people in the organization are coordinated towards the achievement of the organization’s targets. It involves the clarification of the objective, planning, organizing, directing and controlling other peoples’ work (Mullins, 2004). (Appendix 1).
 A manager’s job is always
 complex and varies depending on the type of the business, its capacity, size as well as its position. Managers need certain skills to perform the duties and activities associated with being a manager (Sarfraz, 2011). In order to perform management functions and assume multiple roles, managers must be accomplished and fully capable as demonstrated by Richard Branson (Virgin Group) (Appendix 2), Bill Gates (Microsoft Corporation) (Appendix 3), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop) (Appendix 4). Robert Katz identified those skills necessary for successful performance in managerial roles(Peterson &amp; Fleet, 2004). Those are technical skills, human skills and conceptual skills. (Appendix 5)
Effective and efficient skills will always lead to the success of the organization. Katz found that the relative importance of these skills varied according to...

What is more, these three skills are relatively essential to managers who are at different levels that include first-line, middle, top management positions.

 all levels, especially by top level of managers.

 Skills and Political Skills.  Let us try to discuss this topics as below.

...Katz, Robert L. “Skills of an Effective Administrator,” Harvard Business Review: 1955. Retrieved from: McMahon, Timothy, J. Leaderships Classics. pp. 22-35.

	Robert Katz identifies the selection and training of good administration as one of American industry’s most pressing problems. Katz tells us that at the root of the problem is the industry’s search for the traits and qualities that will identify the
 “ideal executive.” In spending so much time looking at personality and one’s value set, companies are in danger of losing sight of what should be their main concern - what a man can accomplish. We believe that this is definitely still a relevant concern today as well. We see business executives with loads of personality and great people skills, but little to offer the companies in terms of quantifiable work. Even on the basic managerial level, each of us has worked for someone who was very polite and honest and trustworthy, but they were useless when it came to doing their job. We all agree that there must be a better way to select leadership and administration than simply picking out their most attractive qualities.
What makes up a great executive has long been speculated and disputed, but here we see a more practical and useful approach to the selection and development of administrators. What is described for us here is the Three-Skill...

...In general there are three different types of managers, first line managers, middle managers and top managers. Each of the three managers has different specific ability required. This essay focuses on top-level managers and what are the skills necessary for top-level manager or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). This thesis will also identifies the three types of managerial skill and compares Katz theory of
 Managerial Skills with Minzberg theory of Managerial Roles. Chief executives officers (CEOs) are certainly responsible enough for their position in the firm. 

“Top managers are managers at or near the top level of the organisation who are responsible for making organisation-wide decisions and establishing the goals and plans that affect the entire organisation.” (Robbins, Bergman Stagg & Coulter, 2009, p. 9). According to Mintzberg theory, there are 10 managerial roles for managers. Afterward, in the 20th century, Henri Fayol approached with the supposition of five categories of management functions. In 1955, Katz came up with a straightforward idea called management skills. Robert L.Katz discovered that managers need three very important skills or capabilities.
