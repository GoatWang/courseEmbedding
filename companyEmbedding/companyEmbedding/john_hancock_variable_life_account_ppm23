Why Do You Need Life Insurance?



Life insurance can be one of the most important purchases you will make. You want your family or business to be financially secure, to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and even leave a legacy for your children and grandchildren. No matter what your goals are, the unique tax benefits and features of life insurance can help you to achieve them. 


Types of Life Insurance
Choosing the right type of life insurance depends on your circumstances and financial goals. Life insurance policies are designed to pay a death benefit when someone dies, but there are usually two basic categories to meet your different needs - term and permanent. 
Term life insurance in general, provides death benefit protection for a specific period of time.
Permanent life insurance offers lifetime death benefit protection with a cash value component. This can mean lifetime peace of mind for you and your family.
Different types of permanent life insurance are usually categorized as follows: Universal Life Insurance, Indexed Universal Life Insurance, and Variable Universal Life Insurance. To find out what life insurance solution best meets your needs, visit JohnHancockInsurance.com.



















We believe that life insurance should reward you for healthy living. That's why we introduced life insurance with the John Hancock Vitality Program. It's an innovative solution that gives you the protection you need, along with premium savings up to 15% and rewards from national brands for the everyday things you do to stay healthy, like exercising, walking, and eating well.

Prospectus:   John Hancock Variable Insurance Trust
This material is authorized for distribution only when preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. The prospectus contains complete details on investment objectives, risks, fees, charges and expenses as well as other information about the investment company. Please read the prospectus carefully containing this and other information on the product and the underlying portfolios and consider these factors carefully before investing.
Insurance policies and/or associated riders and features may not be available in all states.
Variable universal life insurance has annual fees and expenses associated with it in addition to life insurance related charges (which differ with the product chosen), including surrender charges and investment management fees. Variable universal life insurance products are long-term contracts and are sold by prospectus.  They are subject to market risk due to the underlying sub-accounts, and are unsuitable as a short term savings vehicle. The primary purpose of variable universal life insurance is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person.  Cash values are not guaranteed if the client is invested in the investment accounts.  There are risks associated with each investment option, and the policy may lose value.

The portfolios in John Hancock Variable Insurance Trust described above are not retail mutual funds and are only available under variable annuity contracts, variable life policies or through participation in tax qualified retirement plans.  Although the portfolios' investment adviser or subadvisers may manage retail mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives, no representation is made, and no assurance is given, that any portfolio's investment results will be comparable to the investment results of any other fund, including other funds with the same investment adviser or subadviser.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Portfolios that invest in high-yield securities are subject to greater credit risk and price fluctuation than portfolios that invest in higher-quality securities. Some portfolios invest primarily in the securities of small companies. The risks associated with investments in small companies include shorter operating histories, less publicly available information, reduced liquidity and increased price volatility.
The securities markets of many of the emerging markets in which the portfolio may invest are substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the United States and other more developed countries. REITs involve risks such as refinancing, economic conditions in the real estate industry, changes in property values, dependency on real estate management, and other risks associated with a portfolio that concentrates its investments in one sector or geographic region. Foreign investments involve risks and opportunities different from domestic investments such as currency rate fluctuations and differences in financial reporting as well as risks associated with exposure to possible economic, political and social instability.
