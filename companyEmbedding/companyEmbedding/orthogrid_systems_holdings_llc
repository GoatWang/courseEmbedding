 Cost-effective

  






        	 
        

 








How Does HipGrid Work?


HipGrid attaches to a 12" C-arm image intensifier. Once in place and covered by a sterile drape, the surgeon positions the grid pattern over the appropriate anatomical landmarks to visualize and assess implant positioning, leg length and hip offset.










Failing to restore anatomic alignment can be costly.Finding a solution doesn't have to be. 







Optimize Outcomes
Ensure proper implant positioning and anatomic alignment in direct anterior total hip arthroplasty with visual references provided by HipGrid.





Save Money
Avoid large capital expenditures and recurring sterilization costs with HipGrid.





Minimize Risk
HipGrid is surgeon operated, reducing the need for additional OR personnel.  Additionally, surgeons can expect to become proficient with the technology after 1-2 cases.
