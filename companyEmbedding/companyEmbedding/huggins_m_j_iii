This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

                                    1997 - Current                


CresCom Bank


                  CresCom Bank’s origins were derived from the consolidation of Crescent Bank and Community FirstBank. The firm's roots run deep along the South Carolina coast.Both Community FirstBank (Charleston) and Crescent Bank (Myrtle Beach) were founded by local business leaders committed to building successful banks in both cities under the umbrella of parent holding company Carolina Financial Corporation. The reason for both banks forming was the same: as a response to several large bank mergers that left few community banking choices for area residents and businesses.Carolina Financial Corporation was founded in 1997 in Charleston and quickly introduced Community FirstBank. Expanding over the course of 15 years, the bank grew to six locations throughout the area, providing banking products and exceptional service to the Greater Charleston market.In order to bring the community banking atmosphere back to Myrtle Beach, Carolina Financial Corporation partnered with business leaders in the Myrtle Beach area to form another community bank – Crescent Bank. Through the years, Crescent Bank grew to four full-service locations to meet the banking needs of Grand Strand residents and businesses. After 11 years of operating the banks as two independent banks, the Board of Directors and management recognized consolidating the two banks into one would create more opportunities and better service to their customers.As a result, on March 26, 2012, the firm's sister banks consolidated to become one bank – CresCom Bank. The name and the logo pay tribute to its former brands by using elements from both Crescent and Community FirstBank, along with the Crescent Moon, which is such an iconic brand element of the state.Consolidated, now CresCom Bank has 14 locations along the coast of South Carolina. Offering a strong core of banking products and services and a committed group of community leaders, management and personnel, CresCom Bank remains committed to warm, exceptional service and a strong knowledge of local businesses and economic trends.It’s this dedication that makes \"\"Have a nice bank.\"\" more than just a slogan, but a commitment to service. This, combined with the years of experience and unique understanding of financial opportunities along coastal South Carolina, makes CresCom Bank the perfect fit for customers' personal or business financial needs.The company believes that community involvement is a vital key to understanding the needs of both the Grand Strand and the Charleston markets. They strive to know customers by customers' name and not just a number. And, as always, we strive to understand and assist customers' with their specific banking needs. The firm's main goal is to provide the best possible financial products and services, exceptional customer service and a unique a personal touch.
