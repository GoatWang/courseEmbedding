Technology






CrimpFin™ Heat Sink
Thermal Management is critical to ensure long life of LED’s and electronics. The  new Z series of products utilizes a CrimpFin™ design that dramatically increases the surface area and the thermal transfer efficiency. As shown in this illustration, this technique allows for a cooler product that is much lighter than the aluminum die cast designs often seen in the marketplace. The New ZPAR has the ultimate combination of patented thermal management and LED efficacy – and a benefit of this is the reduction in heat sink surface necessary to cool the ZPAR – resulting in a staggering 44% reduction in overall weight of the product. At 236g, the ZPAR is the lightest LED PAR lamp available today.




Custom Optics
The custom optics in MSi lamps are specifically designed and engineered for accent and spot lighting applications. These optics feature high CBCP to spot merchandise without loss of peripheral light or wide beam angles, and smooth lambertian patterns to meet the general lighting needs without any watermarks, shadows or lines.






Electronics
At the heart of all MSi products are electronics that are built to deliver maximum efficiency while supporting an aggressive warranty program of five years with a life of 50,000 hours. The dimmable versions of the products use a two stage regulator that allow for Power Factor that is greater than 0.95 while providing more efficient control of LEDs. A microcontroller in the product identifies the dimmer type and implements algorithms that ensure proper operation in applications using multiple dimmers.





Performance LED Chip
MSi features the highest quality custom binned LED’s in their products. MSi only uses the highest quality LED’s available today in both brightness and reliability with efficient, environmentally friendly LED’s. The new ZPAR’s feature the industry’s brightest, highest-performance lighting-class LED., with breakthrough light output and lumens per watt efficacy, MSi and our LED chip partners have designed a line of commercial grade performance products tailor-made for very high-lumen indoor commercial applications.





Custom PCB
MSi creates only custom PCB’s in house. We use all of the latest proprietary conductive materials and conduct extensive optical and electrical tests and inspections with 100% production traceability. We use the latest high temperature long life capacitors in all of our commercial grade products.









History







MSi started more than a decade ago in the mining industry, and today is the world leader in solid-state lighting technology for miner’s cap-lights. MSI has provided hundreds of thousands of LED mine lighting products to the gold and platinum mines throughout the world. We created the solution for thousands of miners who daily found themselves two miles underground, in dark, harsh conditions with a heavy battery attached to a hot halogen light inches from their heads. Today, these miners sport a brighter, clearer, longer-lasting LED cap light that gives off virtually no heat and performs consistently for an entire 24-hour shift – and BEYOND. MSi’s cap lamp is the most sought-after light under the world – but now we’re also one of the most sought after brands on top of the world! Since 2005, MSi has remained focused in one core area – accent spot and flood lighting – and focused on a select group of target trade channels – particularly in the areas of retail, hospitality, furniture, museum and commercial, with the strategy of garnering sales through the re-lamping of existing targets with simple screw-in opportunities with our portfolio of products.
MSi has secondary targets of collaborating with designers and architects, securing Military and Government contracts through our GSA schedule, introducing MSi products to International distributors and bringing the products to small and mid-size businesses through our extensive distributor network. In 2012, MSi won the prestigious INC 500 award as one of the 500 fastest growing companies in America, and in 2013 received an equity investment from 3M.
We have carefully cultivated a brand that speaks to quality, performance, patented features including our optic, heat sink and all-in-one T8 tube, and commitment to commercial grade performance lighting. We translate best to the end user who requires optimum lighting to sell products. Whether it is a mannequin, a furniture piece or a display of merchandise, if the end user relies on lighting to enhance and accent their products – no LED light outperforms MSi. Our message is focused and consistent. Our product is superior and patented, and our strategy is to be considered the leader in this category – and we believe we are well on our way to achieving this objective.

 
























Testimonials




“I am amazed by the color and crispness of the MSi products. They have made a huge difference in our showroom.”
-National Furniture retailer
“We have converted every one of our stores to LED with MSi. The stores are brighter and the merchandise looks fabulous. Thank you MSi. We’re delighted.”
–Retail store executive
“Thank you, Thank You, Thank you!. WOW. I never knew my restaurant could look so good. Your LED lights have made all the difference.”
-Restaurant Chain COO


“ Believe me, we tested ALL of the LED lamps, and then chose MSi. They have a smoother light and no shadows or watermarks. The quality of the light seems to be superior to everyone else’s.”
–World renowned Museum Curator
“I don’t know why anyone is still undecided on LED. Our stores are brighter, cooler and our power bill has been cut in half. It’s been a no-brainer.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
