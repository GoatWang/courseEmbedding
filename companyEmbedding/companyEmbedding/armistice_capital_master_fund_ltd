What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

The funds for the purchase of the Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons came from working capital of the Master Fund, which is the direct owner of the Shares.  The net investment costs (including commissions, if any) of the Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons is approximately $28,733,265.  No borrowed funds were used to purchase the Shares, other than any borrowed funds used for working capital purposes (including certain leverage arrangements) in the ordinary course of business.

 


 
 
 












Item 4.


Purpose of Transaction.


 



 
 
 



 


On June 2, 2015, Armistice Capital sent a second letter (the "Letter") to the Issuer's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rajesh C. Shrotriya, MD, and its Board of Directors (the "Board"). In the Letter, Armistice Capital reiterates several of the points made in its prior letter sent to Dr. Shrotriya and the Board on May 11, 2015, which is attached as Exhibit B to the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons on May 12, 2015, and discusses an indifference to execution on the part of the Issuer's management.  Specifically, Armistice Capital again requests that the Board disclose any offers it has received related to the sale of the Issuer and questions the Board's criteria for determining which offers to consider and disclose and its ability to execute a sale.  Armistice Capital offers to assist the Issuer in facilitating a sale.  The Letter uses comparable companies to identify excessive Board compensation.  The Letter also specifically describes how Armistice Capital believes the Issuer has mismanaged six specific drugs: Folotyn, Marqibo, Fusilev, Zevalin, RenaZorb and apaziquone.  Further, the Letter states that Armistice Capital prefers a complete sale of the Issuer.  The Letter describes the advantages that certain acquirers may have over the Issuer.  Armistice Capital also states in the Letter that it welcomes discussing all of the points outlined in the Letter in more detail with Dr. Shrotriya and the Board.
 
The foregoing description of the Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Letter, which is filed as Exhibit B, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Reporting Persons purchased the Shares based on the Reporting Persons' belief that the Shares, when purchased, were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity. Depending upon overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the Reporting Persons, and the availability of Shares at prices that would make the purchase or sale of Shares desirable, the Reporting Persons may endeavor to increase or decrease their position in the Issuer through, among other things, the purchase or sale of Shares on the open market or in private transactions or otherwise, on such terms and at such times as the Reporting Persons may deem advisable.
 
The Reporting Persons intend to review their investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Depending on various factors including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position and investment strategy, the price levels of the Shares, conditions in the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions, the Reporting Persons may in the future take such actions with respect to their investment in the Issuer as they deem appropriate including, without limitation, engaging in communications with management and the Board, engaging in discussions with stockholders of the Issuer and others about the Issuer and the Reporting Persons' investment, making proposals to the Issuer concerning changes to the capitalization, ownership structure, board structure (including board composition) or operations of the Issuer, purchasing additional Shares, selling some or all of their Shares, engaging in short selling of or any hedging or similar transaction with respect to the Shares, or changing their intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in subparagraphs (a) - (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
 
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Reporting Persons do not have any present plans or proposals which would relate to, or result in, the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) – (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
 
The Reporting Persons reserve the right, at a later date, to effect one or more of such changes or transactions in the number of Shares they may be deemed to beneficially own.
 


 



 
 

 










Item 5.


Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


 




 


 


 




 


(a) - (d)


As of the date hereof, each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 4,424,000 Shares, constituting 6.6% of the Shares, based upon 66,995,054 Shares outstanding as of the date hereof.  Each of the Reporting Persons has the sole power to vote or direct the vote of 0 Shares and the shared power to vote or direct the vote of 4,424,000 Shares.  Each of the Reporting Persons has the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of 0 Shares and the shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of 4,424,000 Shares.  All of the Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons were acquired in open market transactions.

Exhibit B

June 2, 2015



Rajesh C. Shrotriya, MD
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
11500 South Eastern Avenue, Suite 240
Henderson, NV 89052


cc: Board of Directors


Dr. Shrotriya:
I appreciate you traveling to New York to meet with me on Tuesday, May 19th. And I appreciate our subsequent phone conversations. However, saying that the Board takes its fiduciary responsibility "seriously" and that the Company will evaluate "any serious offer it receives" is not good enough.
How does the Board of Directors define a "serious offer"? After losing the Sandoz litigation and deferring Fusilev revenue in the first quarter earnings release, the market said SPPI was worth $5.68 per share. Even at that price 1/3 of the shares were sold short.  In our meetings it became clear that you believe my reference to a 40% premium, or $8 per share, is too low a purchase price for the Company. Why should your biased view outweigh an efficient market? As a long-term shareholder, I am positively biased, too. And I believe that the Company will fetch more than $8. But I recognize that the market is the ultimate weighing machine. To ignore it is both irresponsible and indefensible.
Your bias extends beyond share ownership. As discussed, executive compensation at Spectrum has been deplorable for more than ten years. Your Board has ignored two consecutive negative shareholder votes on the annual "Say on Pay." Not coincidentally, they are overpaid, too. The average board member at Spectrum earns nearly the same compensation as board members of Eli Lilly ("LLY") and Merck & Co ("MRK"), companies greater than 100x the size of SPPI. Over the last three years, Spectrum board members have earned 2x the compensation of board members of truly comparable hematology/oncology companies such as AMAG Pharmaceuticals ("AMAG"), Array Biopharma ("ARRY"), Infinity Pharmaceuticals ("INFI"), and TG Therapeutics ("TGTX"). Each of these companies has a market capitalization twice as large as SPPI. Of the seven board members at Spectrum, three have at one point or another had their primary income come from the Company. We believe all but one have worked with you in some capacity in the past. Two have had family members employed at the Company.
Beyond bias, not one of your Board members has valuation expertise. Not one of your Board members has shepherded an exit greater than $125 million. In fact, from the dates your Board members have become affiliated with public companies (not including SPPI) through the end of May 2015, the median share price performance of those companies is -49%. Not surprisingly, they are unwilling to engage in a conversation with me about creating shareholder value.
Armistice reiterates our request for Spectrum to immediately disclose any formal or informal expressions of interest and/or non-binding offers to acquire the Company. We are aware of multiple parties interested in acquiring SPPI. Some of these companies have an outward strategy to make and integrate acquisitions and have completed purchases significantly larger than SPPI. We request that the Board of Directors immediately engage a top-tier investment bank and initiate a formal process to sell the Company. We are happy to provide any bank a list of potential suitors or to make the introductions personally.
I want to be clear. Our interest in selling the Company is not driven by short-term thinking. It is the logical conclusion to years of unfulfilled promises. To your credit, you have amassed a collection of valuable assets. However, you have demonstrated an indifference to execution that puts the value of these assets at risk.
Take Folotyn, as an example. You made a tremendous bargain purchase of Allos Therapeutics ("ALTH") in 2012. At the time you projected Folotyn sales could eventually reach $100 million. ALTH had given guidance of $50-55 million of sales for 2012. In Spectrum's hands, Folotyn has yet to achieve $50 million of annual sales. You referenced combination studies with Fusilev. Those have been cancelled due to patient preference for an oral rinse, like MuGard. You referenced label expansion into indications like breast, lung, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ("ALL"). No work has been done. Not pursuing non-small cell lung cancer is most disappointing given the positive proof-of-concept data generated by ALTH.
Look at Marqibo. Once again, you made a tremendous bargain purchase of Talon Therapeutics ("TLON"). Once again, you touted the benefits of the drug – the ability to give higher doses and the reduction of peripheral neuropathy. You talked about twenty indications of use for traditional vincristine. Yet you have not taken any concrete steps to capture the opportunity. We believe the ALL trial is enrolling slowly and the German non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ("NHL") trial is years from completion. The Company seems barely aware of the 2004 FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting to discuss the Marqibo data then generated by Inex and Enzon Pharmaceuticals. Armistice believes there is an accelerated path to NCCN Compendium listing. Your indifference to execution impairs Marqibo's value.
The elephant in the room is Fusilev. On February 27, 2013, you stated, "our product revenue will grow and operating income will grow…we expect year-over-year Fusilev sales to continue to grow." Thirteen days later, on March 12th, the Company lowered its annual revenue guidance to an estimated decline of -33% to -40%. You ended up delivering less than the bottom end of the range. Fusilev sales, which you said would grow, declined from $204 million in 2012 to $68 million in 2013, a decline of -67%.
In early 2013, you touted Zevalin's growth and said you expect sales of the drug to eventually reach $300 million. In 2014, sales of Zevalin were $22 million, a -25% decline from the previous year. Nine months ago you said you would out-license RenaZorb. More than two years ago you said you were planning its Phase II program. Nothing has happened. The apaziquone Phase III studies failed in 2012. Three years later you released the data. Upon re-acquiring the rights to apaziquone from Allergan, you announced you would submit a New Drug Application in 2013. More than two years later nothing has happened.
The list goes on and on. Trials are announced and never completed. Drugs like Ozarelix and SPI-1620 are highlighted and then never spoken of again. The recent patent litigation on Fusilev was mismanaged and immediately swept under the rug. The Company recently uploaded a new investor presentation in which there is no mention of SPPI's revenue, financial position, or commercial operations. These are the Company's most valuable assets. Your indifference puts their value at risk.
In the right hands, Spectrum could be transformed into an exciting, pure play specialty oncology company. Potential acquirers have greater access to capital, manufacturing / distributor synergies, tax advantaged corporate structures, demonstrated abilities to capture overhead synergies, track records of R&D success, and finally, investor trust. They give guidance, which Spectrum has not done since 2Q 2013; and most importantly, they execute against it.
Armistice is committed to affecting change at Spectrum. We encourage fellow shareholders to make their voices heard. We will not hesitate to nominate qualified directors to the SPPI board. And we are evaluating all options to ensure our requests are met.
For the avoidance of doubt, Armistice does not support a potential spin-off of the Company's development stage assets. Nor do we support the Company's commercial infrastructure being dismantled. We are steadfast in our belief that the Company needs to be sold immediately.
I welcome further discussion with you and the Board.


Sincerely,

Steve Boyd
Managing Member

					Opalesque Industry Update - Hedge Funds Review and BarclayHedge recognized the best performing hedge funds and funds of hedge funds in the Americas at the second Hedge Funds Review Americas Awards (at an event on July 25) in New York City. 

“The depth and breadth of the funds receiving awards is proof positive that selecting the right managers is crucial to putting together a hedge fund portfolio that delivers significant risk adjusted returns,” said Margie Lindsay, editor of Hedge Funds Review, adding, “The list of winners should help convince doubters that hedge funds are more than capable of producing double digit returns on a consistent basis.” 

A portfolio consisting of the winning funds in the one-year single manager performance categories would have returned nearly 25% in the 12 months to the end of March 2013 – the period under consideration for the awards – with volatility of only 2.37% and a Sharpe ratio above 10. 

The Hildene Opportunities Fund, winner of the hedge fund of the year award, had its best year so far in 2012 with gains of over 45% and has returned around 30% annually since inception in 2008. 

The list of winners includes many hedge funds that posted high double-digit returns in 2012 including: KSA Capital Partners, named best long/short equity hedge fund; Crabel Multi-Product, winner of the best CTA/managed futures hedge fund; and 400 Capital Credit Opportunities Fund, best fixed income/credit hedge fund. 

“The range of funds and funds of hedge funds winning awards reflects the wide variety of hedge fund strategies available to investors. The presence of emerging managers in the awards is another sign of the growth and health of the hedge fund industry,” said Sol Waksman, founder and President of BarclayHedge, Ltd. “From our perspective at BarclayHedge, the range of strategies offered by the winning funds display some of the very best characteristics of the industry and should encourage even more investment by pension funds and others.” 

The awards also recognise the performance of funds of hedge funds (FoHFs). SkyBridge Capital picked up the award for FoHF of the year. Titan Advisors, Magnitude Capital, Gapstow Capital Partners, DGAM and Ssaris were among the other FoHFs collecting accolades. 

Says Margie Lindsay, “The strong showing by some top funds of hedge funds also shows this sector of the industry still has a vital role to play.” 

The industry's rising stars were also recognised in a series of qualitative awards. Credit specialist Prosiris Capital Management, led by former Goldman Sachs proprietary trader Reza Ali, was named the best emerging hedge fund manager. Prosiris has posted annualised returns of nearly 25% since inception in mid-2011 and already manages close to $1 billion. 

Steven Boyd's Armistice Capital was named the best new hedge fund. A long/short equity manager with a clear thesis on how to beat the markets, Armistice's 48% return since inception in July 2012 makes it one to watch for the future. 

The awards also rewarded some of the industry's biggest and best-known names. 

AQR Capital Management was named the most innovative hedge fund, while Blackstone Alternative Asset Management won the best overall FoHF group category. Millennium Management was recognised for its excellent investor relations team. 

Citadel claimed the award for best overall hedge fund group. The Chicago-based asset manager is coming off one of its best-ever years, with industry-leading returns across a wide range of strategies and products. The group has steadily expanded its product range in recent years, launching a series of single-strategy funds alongside its longstanding multi-strategy offering, while maintaining its relentless focus on performance. 
Hedge Funds Review's lifetime achievement award was presented to Donald Sussman of Paloma Partners, one of the most respected and well-liked figures in the industry. Sussman has been at the cutting edge of the financial markets for more than three decades. Paloma was one of the first hedge funds to use computer technology and quantitative techniques to invest in the 1980s and has a long history of backing talented managers with fresh ideas. 

Sussman remains as enthusiastic as ever about hedge fund investing, telling Hedge Funds Review, "Quality hedge funds do generally generate alpha and that is the key to preserving capital." 

Another qualitative award recognised the industry's most important participants: end investors. 

The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTTP) received the award for outstanding contribution to the industry by an institutional investor. OTTP, which manages the retirement assets of more than 300,000 teachers in the province of Ontario, is a trailblazer and pioneer among institutional investors. 

The plan was an early adopter of hedge funds in the 1990s and has continued to evolve its approach to alternative investing over the years. OTTP looks for unique and innovative alternative strategies that offer diversification benefits and improve its risk-adjusted returns. It has built strong relationships with hedge fund managers and works tirelessly to promote best practices in the industry. 

The September issue of Hedge Funds Review will feature a special interview with Ron Mock, senior vice-president of fixed income and alternative investments at OTTP, who will take over as the plan's CEO next year. Citadel and AQR will also be profiled in the magazine. 

The winners of the Americas Awards 2013 were selected based on a rigorous methodology that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis. The process started with running a quantitative screen over all funds reporting to the BarclayHedge database to extract raw performance figures as well as other important metrics. Information on non-reporting funds was independently sourced. 

Funds that met the qualification criteria and had top-quartile returns in their category were ranked based on returns, Sharpe ratio and downside deviation. An independent panel of judges reviewed all the risk and return metrics on the top-ranked funds and selected the winners. 

In selecting the winning funds, the judges took into account the quantitative analysis as well as their qualitative experience and expertise. 

Where judges were conflicted in an award category, they stood aside from judging. The winners of the qualitative awards were selected at the discretion of the judges. 

HFIM also helped prepare the quantitative analysis from the performance data. 

BarclayHedge provided performance data and ran the quantitative screens. 

Winners were recognised at a reception attended by 150 people at the Rooftop of the Roosevelt Hotel, New York City.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Winners announced for second Hedge Funds Review Americas Awards 2013
Fairfield, July 26, 2013  – Hedge Funds Review and BarclayHedge recognized the best performing hedge funds and funds of hedge funds in the Americas at the second Hedge Funds Review Americas Awards (at an event on July 25) in New York City.  


�The depth and breadth of the funds receiving awards is proof positive that selecting the right managers is crucial to putting together a hedge fund portfolio that delivers significant risk adjusted returns,� said Margie Lindsay, editor of Hedge Funds Review, adding, �The list of winners should help convince doubters that hedge funds are more than capable of producing double digit returns on a consistent basis.�  


A portfolio consisting of the winning funds in the one-year single manager performance categories would have returned nearly 25% in the 12 months to the end of March 2013 � the period under consideration for the awards � with volatility of only 2.37% and a Sharpe ratio above 10.


The Hildene Opportunities Fund, winner of the hedge fund of the year award, had its best year so far in 2012 with gains of over 45% and has returned around 30% annually since inception in 2008.


The list of winners includes many hedge funds that posted high double-digit returns in 2012 including: KSA Capital Partners, named best long/short equity hedge fund; Crabel Multi-Product, winner of the best CTA/managed futures hedge fund; and 400 Capital Credit Opportunities Fund, best fixed income/credit hedge fund.


�The range of funds and funds of hedge funds winning awards reflects the wide variety of hedge fund strategies available to investors. The presence of emerging managers in the awards is another sign of the growth and health of the hedge fund industry,� said Sol Waksman, founder and President of BarclayHedge, Ltd. �From our perspective at BarclayHedge, the range of strategies offered by the winning funds display some of the very best characteristics of the industry and should encourage even more investment by pension funds and others.�


The awards also recognise the performance of funds of hedge funds (FoHFs). SkyBridge Capital picked up the award for FoHF of the year. Titan Advisors, Magnitude Capital, Gapstow Capital Partners, DGAM and Ssaris were among the other FoHFs collecting accolades.


Says Margie Lindsay, �The strong showing by some top funds of hedge funds also shows this sector of the industry still has a vital role to play.�


The industry's rising stars were also recognised in a series of qualitative awards.
Credit specialist Prosiris Capital Management, led by former Goldman Sachs proprietary trader Reza Ali, was named the best emerging hedge fund manager. Prosiris has posted annualised returns of nearly 25% since inception in mid-2011 and already manages close to $1 billion.


Steven Boyd's Armistice Capital was named the best new hedge fund. A long/short equity manager with a clear thesis on how to beat the markets, Armistice's 48% return since inception in July 2012 makes it one to watch for the future.


The awards also rewarded some of the industry's biggest and best-known names.


AQR Capital Management was named the most innovative hedge fund, while Blackstone Alternative Asset Management won the best overall FoHF group category. Millennium Management was recognised for its excellent investor relations team.


Citadel claimed the award for best overall hedge fund group. The Chicago-based asset manager is coming off one of its best-ever years, with industry-leading returns across a wide range of strategies and products. The group has steadily expanded its product range in recent years, launching a series of single-strategy funds alongside its longstanding multi-strategy offering, while maintaining its relentless focus on performance.


Hedge Funds Review's lifetime achievement award was presented to Donald Sussman of Paloma Partners, one of the most respected and well-liked figures in the industry. Sussman has been at the cutting edge of the financial markets for more than three decades. Paloma was one of the first hedge funds to use computer technology and quantitative techniques to invest in the 1980s and has a long history of backing talented managers with fresh ideas.


Sussman remains as enthusiastic as ever about hedge fund investing, telling  Hedge Funds Review, "Quality hedge funds do generally generate alpha and that is the key to preserving capital."


Another qualitative award recognised the industry's most important participants: end investors.


The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTTP) received the award for outstanding contribution to the industry by an institutional investor. OTTP, which manages the retirement assets of more than 300,000 teachers in the province of Ontario, is a trailblazer and pioneer among institutional investors.


The plan was an early adopter of hedge funds in the 1990s and has continued to evolve its approach to alternative investing over the years. OTTP looks for unique and innovative alternative strategies that offer diversification benefits and improve its risk-adjusted returns. It has built strong relationships with hedge fund managers and works tirelessly to promote best practices in the industry.


The September issue of  Hedge Funds Review will feature a special interview with Ron Mock, senior vice-president of fixed income and alternative investments at OTTP, who will take over as the plan's CEO next year. Citadel and AQR will also be profiled in the magazine.


The winners of the Americas Awards 2013 were selected based on a rigorous methodology that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis. The process started with running a quantitative screen over all funds reporting to the BarclayHedge database to extract raw performance figures as well as other important metrics. Information on non-reporting funds was independently sourced.


Funds that met the qualification criteria and had top-quartile returns in their category were ranked based on returns, Sharpe ratio and downside deviation. An independent panel of judges reviewed all the risk and return metrics on the top-ranked funds and selected the winners.


In selecting the winning funds, the judges took into account the quantitative analysis as well as their qualitative experience and expertise.


Where judges were conflicted in an award category, they stood aside from judging. The winners of the qualitative awards were selected at the discretion of the judges.


HFIM also helped prepare the quantitative analysis from the performance data.


BarclayHedge provided performance data and ran the quantitative screens.


Winners were recognised at a reception attended by 150 people at the Rooftop of the Roosevelt Hotel, New York City.
