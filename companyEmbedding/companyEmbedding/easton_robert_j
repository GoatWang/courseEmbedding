Trust Bibliography
Welcome to our "living bibliography" on trust.
This original bibliography is provided courtesy of Bob Easton, an essay contributor to our book, Trust Inc., Strategies for Building Your Company's Most Valuable Asset.
Robert (Bob) Easton is a Senior Managing Director at Accenture, where he has been for the past 15 years.  Bob has worked and lived throughout the world including: New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Germany, London and currently, the United States.  He is well known for the contributions he has made to building trust based relationships.  Bob's specific research interest is in the relationship between  trust and well-being and the implications for trust models and flourishing institutions.   He calls for a positive deviance of trust and proposes a new conceptualization of trust to achieve this deviance -appreciative trusting or 'the deliberate and intentional pursuit of maximal trust in others-even to the limits of prudence'.  Bob can be contacted at robert.j.easton@accenture.com.
The bibliography will be updated monthly as we receive new references and resources. Please send your suggestions to Barbara Kimmel. E-mail: barbara@trustacrossamerica.com
