Invest in Niveau Smart Energy




We're disrupting the beverage industry by putting a new twist on a lucrative category. The market for alternatives to soft drinks is projected to grow due to increasingly health conscious consumers. More than ever, adults in the United States are attracted to products that are compatible with an active lifestyle and promote health and wellness. The team at Niveau Brands will work to improve market penetration of our flagship product and develop additional product lines and flavors to capitalize off of growing consumer demand.  If you share our vision, please join the us and help make it a reality!A letter from the founders:"Now is a great time to be a health and wellness brand. Niveau Smart Energy is disrupting the energy drink market with an approach that is focused on health and social consciousness.Initially we launched a product that would provide people with nonalcoholic options in their social lives at restaurants, bars and clubs. Non-drinkers would have an option to make them feel healthy and included among their (perhaps partying) peers.Our idea has since evolved into what we believe is the most versatile energy product on the market. There is no right or wrong way to drink Niveau Smart Energy. Drink it straight, over ice, or mixed in any beverage. Drink Smart Energy in the morning before going to the gym, in the afternoon at work, in the evening while out and about with friends, or the next day to help re-hydrate after a long night.Thank you for taking the time to learn about our company. We hope you will join us on the next chapter of our story."Founders Elliott & Marielle

People Love Smart Energy!






"I ordered this product because I am on a diet and need to lose 20 lbs by summer. This one appealed to me because it has zero calories and it has no sugars or artificial flavors. I like that this gives you energy while enhancing your mood. I feel that a bad mood is such a waste of time and not fair to my family and friends. I drink a health smoothie for lunch everyday and I added this to it. I thought it made my smoothie taste amazing. It counteracted the taste of spinach in it." -Nicole

The Energy Drink Market Today






The non-alcoholic beverage industry in US Markets is currently estimated by the NY Times to have a market cap of $135.4B. Consumers are demanding healthier brands in response to obesity rates and scrutiny of the sugar industry. Research suggest that the non-alcoholic beverage industry will be driven by growth in smaller, emerging "Better-for-you brands."The Energy drink category leaders have not responded to consumer demand for health and wellness space brands beyond sugar-free and reduced calorie versions. Niveau Smart Energy is well positioned to capture health and wellness customers in the energy drink market.








Year by Year Growth




This timeline according to Statista depicts the dollar sales of energy drink beverages and shots in the United States in 2011 and provides a forecast for 2012 to 2015. In 2011, dollar sales of energy drink beverages and shots in the United States amounted to about 8.1 billion U.S. dollars. According to the source, it is estimated that category sales will increase to 13.5 billion US dollars by 2015.

THE BUZZ ABOUT NIVEAU SMART ENERGY




These energy shots are calorie-free and sugar-free, and they only contain 10mg of caffeine per serving (which is one 2oz bottle).I felt that these shots gave me roughly the same amount of energy as a 5-Hour Energy shot, but without the nauseating aftertaste or jittery feeling. As far as price, these shots are roughly the same cost as the 5-Hour Energy shots (and even cheaper if purchased in the larger bulk quantities). I really enjoyed these shots and prefer them 200% over other energy shots.


GatorDO17

Amazon Customer




What I love about the Smart Energy  is that they provide more than your standard energy shot, 2 oz. to be exact. It’s nice to actually get what you pay for instead of the container being half empty. I get a lot more value with Smart Energy than the top leading brand. There is savings of cost and volume.
These babies have worked well in helping me to wake up in the morning and get focused on my work. It provides a clear-headed mild energy boost both mentally and physically.

A New Kind of Energy Drink
We occupy the intersection of health-consciousness and image-consciousness.

Niveau Smart Energy is a healthy, natural and great tasting drink formula that offers a fresh citrus flavor, zero calories and positive health benefits. It is designed to help improve your mood and focus, increase your physical energy, and give you the alertness you need without adverse side effects.    

In addition to being a healthy alternative to soft drinks and those "other" energy drinks, our formula is designed to drink alone or mix into your favorite beverage. Smart Energy is a very flexible product for restaurants, bars, and your home kitchen!
  





















 Create New Vitamin-Boosted Drinks 
Our customers love to drink our shots straight or mix them like pros.

Drink it or mix it! Niveau Smart Energy is designed to hydrate and increase alertness and focus. Smart Energy is flexible -- enjoy it chilled over ice or mixed into any beverage. You can add Smart Energy to your favorite juice, smoothie, or cocktail! Check out some of our popular recipes below!    
























 The Energy Drink Market is Booming
People are looking for energy boosts and are more health conscious than ever.

The non-alcoholic beverage industry in US Markets
is currently estimated by the NY Times to have a market cap of $135.4B.

Consumers are demanding healthier brands in response to obesity rates and scrutiny of the sugar industry.
Research suggest that the non-alcoholic beverage industry will be driven by growth in smaller, emerging
"Better-for-you brands."
    

    The Energy drink category leaders have not responded to consumer demand for health and wellness space brands
beyond sugar-free and reduced calorie versions.  Niveau Smart Energy is well positioned to capture
health and wellness customers in the energy drink market.
  







And We're Growing, Too

We've increased our monthly sales by 1628% year over year since October 2015! We’ve also added approximately 400 brick and mortar locations in Q3 2016. There are multiple potential retail channels for distribution of both our 750 ML and 2 oz mini bottles.

Our Sales Partners






















Your Investment Will Help Us Ramp Up Production

We are excited to work with Wefunder to raise capital to increase our production capabilities, employ a sales force, and execute marketing strategies in targeted cities. We are also excited to introduce Niveau Smart Energy to new fans across the United States and World through this platform!
    



Inventory

Increasing inventory capabilities will help us grow at a faster rate. While adding new customers we must invest in raw materials necessary to stay ahead of the growth curve.
            



Sales

Although we like to believe Niveau Smart Energy sells itself, we need to grow our sales team to close deals and manage accounts.

            



Promotions

In-store giveaways and tastings are one of the major keys to success in the our industry. We look to increase our spend in this area which has proven to have a direct impact on our sales growth.            




Let's Have a Toast!


Now is a great time to be a health and wellness brand. Niveau Smart Energy is disrupting the energy drink market with an approach that is focused on health and social consciousness.

      

Initially we launched a product that would provide people with nonalcoholic options in their social lives at restaurants, bars and clubs. Non-drinkers would have an option to make them feel healthy and included among their (perhaps partying) peers.
        

     Our idea has since evolved into the most versatile energy product on the market. There is no right or wrong way to drink Niveau Smart Energy. Drink it straight, over ice, or mixed in any beverage. Drink Smart Energy in the morning before going to the gym, in the afternoon at work, in the evening while out and about with friends, or the next day to help re-hydrate after a long night.
      

We are very excited for the opportunity to utilize the Wefunder platform to expand our company and reach a wider audience. Thank you for taking the time to learn about our company. We hope you will join us on the next chapter of our story.

                  Why Niveau Smart Energy?
                  



Maintaining a healthy lifestyle in social settings is often challenging. Elliott Johnson was inspired to create Niveau Smart Energy during his 100 lb weight-loss journey. During this time period, Elliott wanted to participate in social activities at bars and clubs, but did not want to sacrifice his morning work out by drinking alcohol the night before. Elliott thought, "What if I could hang out with my friends and be healthy, all while having fun?" The concept of Niveau Smart Energy was born.




                  What’s on the horizon?
                  



Niveau Smart Energy is available in one flavor -- our citrus blend -- and two bottle sizes. The 2 oz mini bottle is ideal for a single serving on the go. The 750ML bottle is perfect for home kitchens, bars and restaurants. We plan to expand our product line by offering new flavors and products in 2017, so stay tuned!




                  What's new about what you're making? How is it different?
                  



Niveau Smart Energy is a part of a new category of beverages called "alternative energy drinks".  Smart Energy is not your typical energy drink loaded with caffeine and sugar.  These drinks are designed to spike your energy levels.  Our product is designed to give you focus and natural energy,  while improving your health and memory.



                  How big is the market?
                  



The energy drink market remains huge and is projected to continue growing. The global leader of the market sold 5.96 billion units, up 6%, across 169 countries in 2015.




                  What do you understand about your business that others don't get?
                  



Niveau Smart Energy is not just another energy drink. Niveau Smart Energy is poised to take advantage of two relevant major consumer trends in the US grocery industry. One is the emergence of the mixology culture and the popularity of craft beers and cocktails; the other is the increasing buying power of Millennials. Niveau Smart Energy is in direct alignment with both movements.




                  How did you develop the product?
                  



Our final formula was the culmination of 2 years of research and development to perfect the taste, ingredients, and effectiveness. We knew we were on to something special after participating in various events across the country. Our concept was embraced not only in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we launched, but in other cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and Philadelphia.While we had the vision for our product, we relied on beverage architects for their superior technical expertise and cutting-edge technology to help us to streamline the process. Our food science partner's mission is to never take shortcuts and to produce the best products for discerning clients like us.




                  How is Niveau Smart Energy different from traditional energy drinks?
                  



Our initial concept was to provide a healthy and fun alternative to alcohol in social settings. We wanted to offer a solution that provided health benefits and energy to motivate social behavior. Finally, we wanted to alleviate the peer pressure our customers might feel to drink alcohol at social gatherings.

Packaging Niveau Smart Energy in a 750ML bottle and creating mocktails allowed our customers to "fit in" without drinking.Today Niveau Smart Energy has moved beyond the nightlife space. Our mini bottle provides a perfect healthy boost for the office or the gym. For these reasons, our product is the most flexible energy beverage on the market.




                  Who owns the formula?
                  



Niveau Brands Inc. owns the formula. We've partnered with a large co-packer that has over 50 years of experience to manufacture the finished product. Our intellectual property is protected by sending our partner a blended compound of ingredients.




                  Who are your competitors?
                  



Although we are not a traditional energy drink, we are competing with the category.  We aim to take a piece of the energy drink market, in addition to the functional beverage market, and alternative alcohol market.



                  What advantages do you have over potential competitors?
                  



One of our biggest advantages is our taste.  The average consumer finds our taste profile pleasantly refreshing and non-offensive.  Another advantage is the flexibility of Smart Energy.  Our formula is designed to drink straight or mix in any beverage.



                  How did you come up with the name Niveau Brands?
                  



Niveau, of French origin, translates to a level, stage, standard or plane. The name represents our commitment to set the standards in our industry for quality. English-speaking customers may also recall "nouveau" -- a similar-sounding French word that means "new" -- when they encounter our product and associate our brand with modernity and trendsetting.




                  What are your sales channels?
                  



Currently Niveau Smart Energy is available via e-commerce and through traditional brick and mortar distribution. Our 750 ML cases and 2 ounce bottle packs are flexible for various retailers including convenience stores, grocery stores, bars and restaurants, cafes, gyms and health clubs.




                  Do you have any repeat customers?
                  



Yes! Going back ninety days, approximately 14% of our Amazon buyers are repeat customers. This is a conservative estimate of our overall repeat buyer percentage because we have observed many buyers “stock up” and order bulk amounts on a cycle larger than ninety days and this does not include any sales to our brick and mortar retailers where individual customer buying behavior is much more difficult to track. There is a pattern of customers ordering our 4 pack on Amazon to try the product. Those customers then place follow up recurring orders of 12 or 24 packs on varying cycles specific to individuals. We look forward to analyzing our costumer data in more detail as we grow and capturing more repeat buyers.






                  What are your margins?
                  



Our margins vary depending on the product SKU (750ML, 4pk, 12pk, 24pk) and the retail channel. Gross margins can range from 45% - 70%. We expect margins to improve as we grow. We have not yet reached economies of scale available with larger order quantities for raw ingredients and packaging materials.




                  Why is the timing right to invest?
                  



We've put a lot of sweat equity into the company over the years. Through trial and error we have mitigated some of the risks associated with start-up companies. We realize that there is a huge challenge ahead, but we have the tools to break into this market in a big way! Our vision is clear and we have the traction and dedication to make Niveau Brands a success.

                                        This is a fantastic product, and the small bottles are so convenient. Before the small bottles I had to make my Pre workout drink before work and carry it with me. Now I can stash these little bottles in my desk and mix my drink right before leaving the office and drink it fresh on the way to the gym. Thanks for the small bottles, they are a godsend! Here's hoping that in the near future you add other flavors to the line up.

                                        I never have energy and wanted to try something new in hope of not breaking out in hives or only having high blood pressure when drinking the other energy drink.I was worried when I drank this one and 5 minutes later no hives figured is not going to work but surprise it did is smooth energy and no crash or feeling like I want o fight someone in a ring for a boxing match..
The taste is okay too The other thing I really like I dont have to keep it in the refrigerator I can put it in my purse. We go fly our Inspire 1 drone and lately you can see me jump up and down on video full of energy!

                                        I ordered this product because I am on a diet and need to lose 20 lbs by summer. This one appealed to me because it has zero calories and it has no sugars or artificial flavors. I like that this gives you energy while enhancing your mood. I feel that a bad mood is such a waste of time and not fair to my family and friends. I drink a health smoothie for lunch everyday and I added this to it. I thought it made my smoothie taste amazing. It counteracted the taste of spinach in it.
