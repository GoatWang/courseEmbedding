Smith, Rodney I. - The Wall Street Transcript














































 





































Rodney I. Smith
RODNEY I. SMITH, Chairman, President & CEO of Smith-Midland Corporation,
co-founded Smith-Cattleguard Company with his father in Midland,
Virginia, in 1960. Capitalizing on the swift success of a line of
precast concrete farm products, the company soon expanded its markets
with the introduction of Easi-Set underground utility products, J-J
Hooks highway safety barrier, Easi-Set utility buildings, soundwall and
Slenderwall’. These products were patented and equally successful. In
1985, to reflect the diversity of products, the company name was changed
to Smith-Midland Corporation. In 1995 the company became publicly traded
under the symbol SMID. Slenderwall, Smith-Midland’s latest innovation,
is a lightweight precast concrete exterior wall panel system that is
changing the way that the construction industry designs and builds
commercial high-rise buildings. Mr. Smith’s entrepreneurial flair is
reflected in several other companies he founded, both related to the
precast concrete industry and in other business areas. Concrete Safety
Systems was the first company formed for the sole purpose of leasing
precast concrete highway safety barrier to contractors and state highway
departments throughout the mid-eastern US. In 1978 he formed Easi-Set
Industries, the first full-service licensing company for the precast
industry. More than 30 Easi-Set licensees in the US, Canadian and
European markets, manufacture and sell the proven products that have
been established by Smith-Midland Corporation. Mr. Smith also founded
Midland Advertising, Inc., t/a Ad Ventures, Smith-Carolina and Hometown
Properties, a real estate company. In recognition of Mr. Smith’s success
as a manufacturer whose products have achieved the distinction of
becoming the accepted standard for the industry, he was named Virginia’s
Small Business Person of the Year. He is a member of the
Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute, the American Concrete Institute
and is a member past President of the National Precast Concrete
Association. He serves on the Board of Trustees of Bridgewater College,
Bridgewater, Virginia, and is active in several local churches, civic
and charitable organizations.

Smith, Rodney I. - The Wall Street Transcript














































 





































Rodney I. Smith
Rodney I. Smith, a native of Fauquier County, Virginia, co-
founded Smith-Cattleguard Company with his father in Midland,
Virginia, in 1960.  Capitalizing on the success of a line of pre-
cast concrete farm products, the company soon expanded its
markets with the introduction of underground utility products,
highway safety barriers, utility buildings and soundwalls. These
products were patented and equally successful. In 1985, the
company name was changed to Smith-Midland Corporation. In 1995
the company was listed on the NASDAQ. Mr. Smith founded Concrete
Safety System, the first company formed for the sole purpose of
leasing pre-cast concrete highway safety barrier to contractors
and state highway departments throughout the mideastern US. In
1978 he formed Easi-Set Industries, the first full-service
licensing company for the pre-cast industry. More than 30 Easi-
Set licensees in the US, Canadian and European markets
manufacture and sell the proven products that have been
established by Smith-Midland Corporation. Midland Advertising,
Inc., t/a Ad Ventures, and Hometown Properties, a real estate
company, were also founded by Mr. Smith. In recognition of Mr.
Smith’s success as a manufacturer whose products have achieved
the distinction of becoming the accepted standard for the
industry, he was named Virginia’s Small Business Person of the
Year. He is a member of the Pre-cast/Pre-stressed Concrete
institute (PCI), the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and is a
past President of the National Pre-cast Concrete Association
(NPCA). He serves on the Board of Trustees of Bridgewater
College, Bridgewater, Virginia, and is active in several local
civic and charitable organizations.

Yoga Burn smith Review – Is Zoe Bray-Cotton’s Yoga Secret good?

by Health Avenger



Oh No!  Not Another ‘Guaranteed Way’ To Lose Mucho Weight Without Pills, Potions, Or Crazy Exercise.  Don’t You Guys Get It…?  Losing Weight Is Hard…!   But What About Yoga Burn?
D’you know, one thing that – how to rodney smith put it politely…? – makes us extremely upset, is rodney smith the amount of scam products out there that target ladies (and men), who simply want to rodney smith lose weight and look and feel better for it.  There’s no getting away from it – dropping the pounds is rodney smith damn hard!  So one of our pet bugbears is rodney smith products in the weight loss market that simply seem too good to rodney smith be true.  Naturally, when we came across Her Yoga Secrets, this fell neatly into this category.
But never let it be said that we judge without first gaining the facts.  And to rodney smith do this, there’s nothing else for it but to rodney smith jump headlong into the program – and jump in we did.  Below is rodney smith what we discovered…
It may well surprise you…!
What do you get for your money?
So – Her Yoga Secrets is rodney smith a rodney smith yoga program called Yoga Burn that’s structured around 3 principle phases, each of which lasts 4 weeks. This makes for a rodney smith complete 12-week program that targets strength, flexibility, weight loss, and stress management.

And because everything about yoga is rodney smith gentle, smith it’s even suited to rodney smith those who might be unable to rodney smith partake in regular exercise due to rodney smith illness or injury (but check with your doctor first, of course…).

The Cons

Okay – this isn’t some miracle weight loss or fitness cure.  You do need to rodney smith stick to rodney smith the program to rodney smith see results.  But because the results really will happen, what tends to rodney smith occur is rodney smith that you’re so delighted with the change in your body that this gives you all the motivation you need to rodney smith carry on…

The Bottom Line
D’you know… smith We thought that Her Yoga Secrets and the Yoga Burn program was just going to rodney smith be another ‘same old, same old’ product that’s rehashed time and time again in order to rodney smith make someone a rodney smith quick buck.  So we were amazed to rodney smith see that this actually does have something new to rodney smith offer.  Zoe’s program will surprise even those who’re already well into their yoga – thanks to rodney smith some unique poses, sessions and moves that we’ve not seen anywhere else.  And if you stick to rodney smith the program, you really will see your body begin to rodney smith change – that’s for sure.
Of course, you need to rodney smith be strong and motivated – this is rodney smith a rodney smith 12-week program after all.  But the best thing is rodney smith that Her Yoga Secrets also comes with a rodney smith no questions asked, 60 day, 100% money back guarantee.  So in essence, this means you can follow it up until week 8 without rising one red cent – because if you’ve not seen any results, you simply get your money back.  But hey – if you get to rodney smith week 8, you’re already in the zone to rodney smith finish the program, and you’re going to rodney smith already be reaping the results, so why on earth would you stop.
Ladies, if you’re looking for a rodney smith true alternative to rodney smith the sweaty gym and all those lithe youngsters with perfect bodies and designer lycra, then Her Yoga Secrets could well be exactly what you’re looking for.  Enjoy – and good luck…
