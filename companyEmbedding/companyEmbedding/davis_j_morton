Morty Davis with President-elect Trump











A
great picture of Morty Davis and his grandson Jamie with President-elect Donald
Trump, who praised Morty’s universally admired book From Hard Rocks to Hot
Stocks saying, “Morty Davis has written a chronicle of great triumphs….full
of intriguing speculation and clear insights, provocative, challenging and
enlightening and written by a unique man who really knows the score. A must
read!”



Not
as concise as Larry King’s endorsement, “This is the best book I’ve ever read
on making it big. You’re in the hands of a master. Enjoy.”



In
addition, President Reagan profusely praised Morty’s earlier book Making
America Work Again, whose name President-elect Trump obviously appreciated since
he adopted and paraphrased the title of that brilliant book almost word for
word by using the slogan, “Making America Great Again” in his winning campaign.

J. Morton Davis is a member of the Board of Directors of
Research!America.
Board of
Directors / Research!America
"'His professional ethics have been scrutinized since 1989 by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and repeatedly have been criticized
by Forbes magazine, the Wall Street Journal, and other leading
financial publications,' reported the Orlando Sentinel Tribune
(7/31/93). D.H. Blair & Co., Inc., has on five occasions paid
$15,000 or more in fines by regulators. According to a 1993 Miami Daily
Business Review article, the company was also censured in 1992 by the
National Association of Securities Dealers (Village Voice, 1/31/95)."
(Mother Jones).

Davis' son-in-law Lindsay A. Rosenwald was number one in the 2002
edition of Genetic Engineering News' 100 Molecular Millionaires, with
$617,421,671. Several directors of ImClone, another company under
investigation, made the list as well: Samuel D. Waksal, $122,943,676;
Harlan W. Waksal, $98,714,317, and John Mendelsohn, $12,356,531.
Mendelsohn is Charles A. LeMaistre's successor as President of the MD
Anderson Cancer Center, and a former director of Enron. Gilbert S.
Omenn made the list with $18,977,709.

Campaign contributions
"The owner of D.H. Blair Investment, J. Morton Davis, and his wife
Rosalind, made more than $83,000 in individual contributions in the
1996 election cycle -- including $10,000 to Gingrich's leadership PAC,
the Monday Morning PAC. Rosalind Davis gave the Monday Morning PAC
$5,000 on Oct. 25, 1996, around the same time that Marianne Gingrich
was buying and selling stock underwritten by Davis' husband. According
to a list by Mother Jones, J. Morton Davis was also a charter member of
GOPAC when it was in Gingrich's control and gave the group $20,000.
Recently, Davis successfully lobbied Congress to include a provision in
the tax bill benefiting investors who help support the type of
companies D.H. Blair Investment often underwrites. The Davis family is
no stranger to the campaign finance world. In 1996, D.H. Blair &
Co., a brokerage firm partly owned by Davis' children, paid a $100,000
penalty to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which alleged the
company illegally used contributor lists to solicit clients. One of the
lists requested from the FEC by D.H. Blair & Co.? Newt Gingrich's."

National Association of Securities Dealers Fines
"NASD Rgulation, Inc., today announced that D.H. Blair & Co.
Inc., has been fined $2 million, and will repay almost $2.4 million to
investors who were overcharged as a result of excessive mark-ups in 16
securities, and of other fraudulent conduct," affecting more than 3,100
retail customers in 43 states. "NASD Regulation also found that D.H.
Blair fraudulently increased the price of two of the 16 securities...
shortly after trading began without sufficient purchase orders to
support those increases. As a result, D.H. Blair created an artificial
'profit' in the securities that allowed the preferred customers of one
of the firm's senior managers to benefit by selling their stock back to
the firm. Thereafter, D.H. Blair's brokers used the artificial increase
to solicit new investors to purchase these securities, without
disclosing the circumstances of the price increase." (D.H. Blair And

The Dreyfus Funds
"Upon discovering Mr. Schonberg's fraudulent activities related to
his Chromatics stock purchases Asensio & Company initiated an
investigation of the Dreyfus Funds' other holdings. We received reports
on a total of 19 companies that are highly suspicious. Each of these
companies is or has been overvalued as a result of stock promotions. We
also found two companies where Mr. Schonberg purchased shares in
private transactions before he used Dreyfus Funds' money to buy stock
in the open market... Mr. Schonberg bought 135,000 shares of Cytoclonal
Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the Dreyfus Funds. Kinder Investments L.P., a
fund established for the children and grandchildren of J. Morton Davis
head of D.H. Blair, controlled 9.0% of Cytoclonal's voting power as of
March 19, 1997. Kinder also participated in the private placement for
Chromatics. Peter Janssen controlled 8.9% of Cytoclonal and Bruce
Meyers controlled 9.0% of the voting rights. Both Mr. Janssen and Mr.
Meyers are former employees of D.H. Blair." There were "widespread
comments in the investment community that Mr. Schonberg had personally
received secret payments in return for buying fraudulent stocks with
the Dreyfus Funds." (Dreyfus fund manager engaged in fraudulent
activities. Asensio & Co., June 12, 1998.)

DH Blair & Co. indictment for racketeering
A New York grand jury indicted executives and employees of DH Blair
& Co. on 173 counts that the firm "defrauded its own customers,
other investors, other brokerage firms and securities regulators from
1989 through 1998. The charges include manipulating the prices of IPOs
and engaging in illegal sales tactics, including dodging customers'
orders to sell stocks." The executives charged include Chairman Kenton
Wood and Vice Chairmen Alan Stahler and Kalman Renov, who are
sons-in-law of J. Morton Davis. "J. Morton Davis, who joined Blair in
1961 and bought a majority stake seven years later, was not named in
the indictments. Davis gave the retail brokerage arm of the company to
his family in 1992, retaining control of the investment banking
division, D.H. Blair Investment Banking, which continues to operate
today." (D.H. Blair & Co. Indicted for Racketeering. By Michael
Brick. TheStreet.com Jul 27, 2000.)
DH
Blair & Co. / TheStreet.com
News Communications Inc.
"In the News Communications case, a clique of company insiders --
including the former head of D.H. Blair & Company, J. Morton Davis,
along with bond-market bottom-fisher Wilbur Ross, class-action
mega-lawyer Melvyn Weiss and the family of New York publisher Jerry
Finkelstein -- has come up with a scheme to help themselves to maybe as
much as $12 million of money that the company's outside investors might
assume belongs at least partly to them.... From the point of view of
the insiders, the terms are really quite brilliant. Unable, it would
appear, to find any bond shop craven or shameless enough to underwrite
a placement of notes to buy up the outsiders (what assets could
collateralize the dreck, anyway?), the insiders simply formed
themselves into a group dominated by the aforementioned Mr. Davis -- a
group large enough to command 50.1 percent outright control of the
voting rights in NCOM's stock. The insiders then announced that they
intend to set up a separate shell company to be called Newco, headed by
Jerry's other son (and Andy's brother), Jimmy Finkelstein.... In short,
all that's really happening here is that the outsiders are being forced
to sell to the insiders, who are paying $1.47 million to buy them out.
Where will the money come from? Why, from News Communications' own
balance sheet, where else! Jimmy Finkelstein will pony up $310,000 from
his own pocket (or that of a rich and aging relative -- and we know who
that will be). As for the $1.16 million that remains to be covered,
well, there's the aforementioned $387,000 of News Communications'
remaining cash, which brings us down to $773,000 -- all of which can be
covered simply by selling the company's receivables to a factoring
company." (Going-Private-Itis: Ross, Finkelstein Buy Papers Cheap. By
Christopher Byron. The New York Observer June 25, 2001.)
Byron / New
York Observer 2001
News Communications, Inc., also publishes The Hill, a free weekly
that competes with Roll Call in reporting Congressional news.
Meanwhile, "some of the chain's New York papers have taken heat for
blatant editorializing in favor of certain Democratic candidates,
including Andy Stein, [Chairman] Jerry Finkelstein's son. 'Seems to me
that this is an enterprise that's become a play toy for people, none of
whom have demonstrated a legitimate interest in journalism,' says Carl
Bernstein, the Watergate reporter who was briefly on the board of News
Communications in 1996." (Over the Hill? Adrianne Appel and Madeline

"In September of 1995, JoAnn Manson and her colleagues at the
Harvard Medical School issued a press release regarding the results of
a study of the health risks associated with being fat. The press
release claimed that the data the authors had collected from the Nurses
Health Study provided compelling evidence for the proposition that
'even mild to moderate overweight is associated with a substantial
increase of premature death.' This claim drew an enormous amount of
attention. Indeed over the next five years, the Nurses Health Study
became the most commonly cited piece of evidence in the mass media for
the claim that fat kills. The most charitable way of characterizing
this statement is that it was a gross distortion of the data the study
had collected. A more accurate characterization would be that it was a
lie. In fact, Manson's study had found no statistically significant
increased risk of mortality associated with (let alone caused by) mild
to moderate obesity, as she herself later admitted when pressed on the
point....
"In one of those shocking coincidences that tend to pop up all the
time in the world of obesity research, JoAnn Manson turned out to be a
paid consultant to Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, the company that
developed and patented dexfenfluramine. The failure to note this little
detail is par for the course when it comes to the American media's
eagerness to reprint the propaganda of the diet industry. At the time
that dexfenfluramine and its cousin Fen-Phen were being approved, MIT
professor Richard Wurtman was quoted even more extensively than Manson
on the wonderful fat-free vistas these drugs were opening up, without
it ever being noted that he was a founder and major stockholder in
Interveuron Pharmaceuticals itself...." (The diet industry's dangerous
lies, by Paul Campos. The Rocky Mountain News 2002 May 7.)
