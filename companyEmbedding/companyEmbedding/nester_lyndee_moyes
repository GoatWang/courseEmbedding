the Chris Moyes Trust dated April 27, 2007, the Lyndee Moyes Nester Trust dated April 27, 2007, the
Marti Lyn Moyes Trust dated April 27, 2007 and the Michael J. Moyes Trust dated April 27, 2007
(each a Childs Trust, and collectively, the Childrens Trusts), are Filing Persons as a result
of the distribution of the shares of Companys common stock by The Moyes Childrens Limited
Partnership described in Item 15. As a result of the Merger (defined below), Saint Acquisition
Corporation, a Nevada corporation (MergerCo), which has signed prior Amendments to this Rule
13e-3 Transaction Statement, ceased to exist and consequently is not filing this Final Amendment.

This Final Amendment is being filed pursuant to Rule 13e-3(d)(3) to report the results of the
transaction that is the subject of this Transaction Statement.

All information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Final Amendment concerning
each Filing Person was supplied by such Filing Person, and no other Filing Person, including the
Company, takes responsibility for the accuracy of such information as it relates to any other
Filing Person.

The filing of this Final Amendment shall not be construed as an admission by any of the Filing
Persons or by any affiliate of a Filing Person that any Filing Person is an affiliate of the
Company within the meaning of Rule 13e-3.



Item 10. Source and Amounts of Funds or Other Consideration

Item 10 (a)-(d) is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

     On May 10, 2007, in connection with the consummation of the Merger (as defined below), Swift
entered into a $2.17 billion senior secured credit agreement (Credit Agreement) consisting of
$1.72 billion first lien term loan b and a $300 million revolving credit facility and a $150
million synthetic letter of credit facility. Also in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, Swift issued (in a private transaction pursuant to Rule 144A) $835 million of second
priority senior secured notes (Notes) in two tranches ($595 million of 12.5% fixed rate notes due
2017 and $240 million of floating rate notes due 2015) under separate indentures (Indentures).
The proceeds of the Credit Agreement and the Notes offering will be used to fund the payment of the
merger consideration under the Merger Agreement, pay fees and expenses, refinance existing
corporate and personal debt, and for ongoing working capital and general corporate needs for the
operation of Swift following the Merger.

     The foregoing summary of the Credit Agreement and the Notes does not purport to be complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement and the Indentures, which are
attached as Exhibits hereto and incorporated by reference in their entirety into this Item 10.

Item 15. Additional Information

Item 15(b) is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

     On April 27, 2007, at a special meeting of the Companys shareholders, the Companys
shareholders voted to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), dated as
of January 19, 2007, by and among the Company, Parent and MergerCo.

     On May 9, 2007, the Moyes Childrens Limited Partnership distributed all of its shares of the
Companys common stock to the Childrens Trusts and entered into an assignment agreement, dated May
9, 2007, pursuant to which the Moyes Childrens Limited Partnership assigned to the Childrens
Trusts its rights and obligations under the Rollover Equity Commitment Letter, dated as of January
19, 2007. Immediately thereafter, in furtherance of the Merger and in accordance with the
Assignment Agreement, each Childrens Trust contributed its shares of the Companys common stock to
Parent in exchange for shares of Parent common stock. Accordingly, the Childrens Trusts were
added as Filing Persons to this Final Amendment. Also on May 9, 2007, VJM Investments, L.L.C.
distributed all of its shares of the Companys common stock pro-rata to its members: (i) the Family
Trust, (ii) an irrevocable trust for the children of Jerry and Vickie Moyes, the sole trustee of
which is Gerald F. Ehrlich (the Ehrlich Trust), (iii) the Kylie Hope Sorma Irrevocable Trust and
(iv) the Tyler Chase Irrevocable Trust. As a result of the Merger, the shares of the Companys
common stock held by the Ehrlich Trust, the Kylie Hope Sorma Irrevocable Trust and the Tyler Chase
Irrevocable Trust, were automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(defined below). The shares of the Companys common stock held by the Family Trust were prior to
the effective time of the Merger contributed to Parent in exchange for shares of Parent common
stock, and, as a result of the Merger, such shares of the Companys common stock were cancelled and
ceased to exist.

     On May 10, 2007, the Company filed a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada, pursuant to which MergerCo was merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of MergerCo ceased and the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, other
than shares held in the treasury of the Company and shares owned by Parent immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, was automatically converted into the right to receive $31.55 in cash,
without interest (Merger Consideration). On May 10, 2007, the Company announced the consummation
of the above described transaction in a press release, which is attached hereto as an Exhibit and
is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 15.



     As a result of the Merger, the Companys common stock will cease to trade on NASDAQ as of the
close of trading on May 10, 2007. On May 10, 2007, NASDAQ filed a Form 25 to delist
the Companys common stock. The Company expects to file a Form 15 on or about May 21, 2007, thus
suspending the Companys reporting obligations under Sections 12 and 15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.
