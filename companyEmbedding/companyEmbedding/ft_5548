Johnson, G.P. Landis, A.H. Hofstra, P. Emsbo, C.A. Stricker, A.G. Hunt, and B.G. RuskSuggested Citation: Rye, R.O., C.A. Johnson, G.P. Landis, A.H. Hofstra, P. Emsbo, C.A. Stricker, A.G. Hunt, and B.G. Rusk. 2010. Evolution of ore deposits and technology transfer project—isotope and chemical methods in support of the U.S. Geological Survey Science Strategy, 2003–2008. Circular 1343. U.S. Geological Survey. 43 p. Principal functions of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Resources Program are providing assessments of the location, quantity, and quality of undiscovered mineral deposits, and predicting the environmental impacts of exploration and mine development. The mineral and environmental assessments of domestic deposits are used by planners and decisionmakers to improve the stewardship of public lands and public resources. Assessments of undiscovered mineral deposits on a global scale reveal the potential availability of minerals to the United States and other countries that manufacture goods imported to the United States. These resources are of fundamental relevance to national and international economic and security policy in our globalized world economy...

Leesburg, Fl.


                    
                    Leesburg is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,956 at the 2000 census. As of 2005, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was...

                    Leesburg is a city in Lake County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,956 at the 2000 census. As of 2005, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 19,086. Leesburg is located in central Florida, between Lake Harris and Lake Griffin, at the head of the Oklawaha River system. It is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area. Leesburg is the home of Lake-Sumter State College (LSSC) with campuses also in Clermont, Florida and Sumterville. It is also the home of Beacon College.
Leesburg was first settled in 1857 by Evander McIver Lee. Several of Evander Lee's brothers followed him to the area. One of these brothers, Calvin Lee, was credited with giving the town its name.

The city of Leesburg was first incorporated in 1875, and was the county seat of Sumter County for a time until Lake County was formed in 1887.

In the early 20th century, Leesburg was an important center for watermelon production. In 1930, Leesburg held its first Watermelon Festival, an annual tradition that would last until watermelon production in the area dwindled to the point that watermelons for the last festival in 1957 had to be brought in from outside the area.

In 1938, the WPA began work on the Venetian Gardens waterside park, on the shores of Lake Harris. The canals and gardens of this park have been a centerpiece of the community ever since.

Lake Square Mall, now known as ViaPort, the city's major shopping mall, opened in 1980.

On March 19, 1982, Ozzy Osbourne's guitarist Randy Rhoads, as well as the band's cook and bus driver, were killed in a plane crash at Flying Baron Estates.[4]

The citrus industry was the principal business in Leesburg for many years, until devastating freezes in December 1983 and February 1985 persuaded growers to move their groves further down the Florida peninsula.

In 1997, Leesburg Bikefest started. It has since become an annual spring tradition, with upwards of 250,000 people visiting the motorcycle festival.

Today, most of Leesburg's growth and economic development is the result of the increasing popularity of the area as a retirement destination and the rapid growth of nearby Orlando.

The last scene in the 2009 film "Away We Go" was filmed here.

In 2011 and 2017, the Leesburg High School boys basketball team won the 4A state championship.

                    The city of Leesburg was founded in 1875 and is the biggest city in northern Lake County with a population of 20,117.

In the early years, the city was famous for his large watermelon production.  As a result, Leesburg began holding an annual watermelon festival.  The festival ended once the production of watermelons came down.

Today the town still holds multiple festivals and cultural events throughout the year, most notably the Bikefest during the spring.  This annual event attracts more than 250,000 visitors each year.

Leesburg Venetian Gardens Waterside Park

There are numerous parks throughout the city where locals can enjoy different leisure activities.  The centerpiece of the community is the 64-acre Venetian Gardens Waterside Park on the shores of Lake Harris.  With its canals and gardens it is one of Lake County's most beautiful parks.  The Venetian Cove Marina is a winner of the Florida's Clean Marina and Clean Boatyard certificate.
