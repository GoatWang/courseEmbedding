ABOUT US


      




        Providing energy is about much more than increasing megawatts -
        it's
          about empowering progress.
Sithe Global strives to be among the best in the world
        at implementing large scale, socially responsible power generation projects,
        often in places where success has proven challenging. We believe that
        developing energy projects with a major economic impact while mitigating
        the ecological footprint is the key to sustainable development.

Sithe Global Power, LLC is an international development
        company engaged in the development, construction, acquisition and operation
      of electric generation facilities in attractive markets around the world.
Sithe Global’s management team has extensive industry
        experience and has worked together on numerous greenfield project developments
        and acquisitions. The management team includes many of the former senior
        management and project development team of Sithe Energies, Inc. as well
        as other experienced industry personnel. Sithe Global carries out its
        development and acquisition activities with much of the same strategic
        initiative and focus that helped build Sithe Energies into one of the
        most successful independent power producers in the world. 

We believe that cost-effective electricity, fuel source
      diversification and environmental
      stewardship are all key elements of a socially responsible international
      energy company.
