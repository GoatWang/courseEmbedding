Keysight Labs Historical Contribution

Timeline of Success
Throughout its history, Keysight Laboratories and its predecessors, HP Labs and Agilent Labs, have had a heritage of inventing a long and broad line of successful new technologies. Many of these innovations have been the starting points for major businesses. 
The following are some of the technical and commercialization milestones that mark the accomplishments of what is now Keysight Laboratories. 
2010's
2014
With the launch of Keysight Technologies, the Measurement Research Laboratory (MRL) of Agilent's Electronic Measurement's group becomes Keysight Laboratories.
Agilent introduces DynaFET, a breakthrough device model for nonlinear microwave device simulation in the Advanced Design System (ADS) environment. 
Agilent introduces the world's first 40 GSa/s 10-bit analog-to-digital converter in the MSO-S Series oscilloscopes.  This new data converter delivers industry leading signal fidelity, enabling researchers to examine signals with less uncertainty and improved dynamic range.

2013

Agilent introduces Bounded Uncorrelated Jitter (BUJ) measurement into the popular EZJIT Plus- jitter analysis software which runs on Agilent's real-time oscilloscopes. This new capability enables engineers to separate and measure crosstalk from other factors that degrade high-speed SerDes performance.
Agilent introduces multi-platform mobile device applications enabling remote/mobile collaborative instrument control and interaction based on Labs' technology

2012
Agilent introduces the N4392A optical modulation analyzer geared for manufacturing test of advanced modulation signals used in optical internet transmission. 
Agilent adds four 1-GHz models to its award-winning line of InfiniiVision 3000 X-Series oscilloscopes to address the growing need for higher-bandwidth bench scopes. The new 1-GHz models incorporate proprietary data converters, and are offered at prices starting at what other leading manufacturers charge for models with half the bandwidth. 

2011

Agilent introduces Command Expert software enabling fast and easy PC instrument control supporting the Microsoft Excel and Visual Studio, Agilent SystemVue, National Instruments LabVIEW, and Agilent VEE environments. The many features of Command Expert, including language translation, instrument substitution analysis, documentation lookup and command trialing and sequencing dramatically increase test system programmer productivity.
Agilent introduces Wireless Link Analyzer, based on Labs' technology, enabling seamless LTE signal correlation between the RF and protocol layers.
Agilent introduces the first commercially available capacitance calibration standard for an atomic force microscope. The specifications allow quantitative assessment of material and device properties via the company's award-winning Scanning Microwave Microscopy Mode. Agilent researchers collaborated with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST Boulder Laboratories) to establish the new standard. 
The exceptional performance of the M8190A arbitrary waveform generator is made possible by a14-bit, 7.2 GSa/s digital-to-analog converter designed by Labs.
Enhanced methods for real-time radio frequency emitter geo-location use a network of Agilent N6841A RF Sensors. The network interface allows the sensors to be distributed within a building, throughout a city or across the world. 
Agilent expanded its mixed-signal and digital-storage oscilloscope portfolio with 26 new models; the next-generation InfiniiVision 2000 and 3000 X-Series scopes incorporate proprietary data converters and breakthrough technology that allow advanced capabilities to be included in affordable instruments. 

2010
The Agilent 90000 X-Series oscilloscopes, the world's fastest real-time oscilloscopes, deliver the industry's highest real-time scope measurement accuracy, the only 30-GHz oscilloscope probing system, and the most complete application-specific measurement software. 

2000s
2009
Agilent MXG Signal Generator is the first certified LXI 1.3 Class B instrument to enable distributed, time-synchronized measurements. 
Agilent N4391A optical modulation analyzer is the industry's first time-domain based optical modulation analyzer offering in-depth analysis of amplitude and phase-modulated optical signals. 
Agilent N6841A RF Sensor is a cost-effective digital receiver for radio frequency signal monitoring software.  Multiple receivers combine to form RF sensor networks to improve detection, monitoring and geo-location of emitters in commercial, radio regulatory, security and defense applications. 
Agilent N6854A Geo-location server software for radio frequency (RF) emitter geo-location uses a network of Agilent N6841A RF Sensors. It estimates position of a non-cooperative intermittent or short-duration RF signal using measurements from the sensor network and calculations with time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) techniques. 
The Measurement Research Laboratory, one of the Agilent Research Laboratories, becomes part of the Technology Leadership Organization in Agilent's Electronic Measurements Group.
Agilent Laboratories demonstrates configurable embedded measurement capabilities built into Gigabit Ethernet small form factor pluggables (SFPs) which could enable network service providers to deploy low cost large scale distributed measurement systems.

2008

Agilent N5106A PXB Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) Receiver Tester is the first instrument designed for MIMO. 
Agilent Infiniium 90000A oscilloscopes break the one-billion acquisition samples (1Gpt) memory barrier. 
Agilent Scanning Microwave Microscope combines Agilent's atomic force microscopes and performance network analyzer for electromagnetic measurements at the nanoscale. 

2007

Agilent 6220 Accurate-Mass time-of-flight and 6520 Accurate-Mass quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry systems leverage data conversion technology developed for oscilloscopes.

Keysight After School Program

Keysight After School is a hands-on science program for children between the ages of 9 and 13 years in communities where Keysight Technologies has a presence. Keysight After School features 23 different hands-on life, physical and earth-science experiments designed as complete "programs-in-a-box."


Keysight After School science kits contain all the materials for children to build science experiments, including electronic-circuit games, balloon-powered cars, clean water engineering and more. Keysight employee volunteers are provided all the tools and materials to lead students through the various science experiments. More information about the kits can be found at the Youth Exploration in Science website.

After completing their experiments, Keysight After School participants are encouraged to take their finished project with them. This provides an opportunity for the children to continue learning the concept, share the project with family and friends, or show it to their teachers.

This program supplements in-school science lessons and supports most international, federal and state science standards. Keysight After School can be implemented in a school setting, or in non-traditional venues such as community centers, museums, hospitals or non-governmental organizations.

Keysight After School is fully funded by Keysight and implemented by its employees, and is provided at no cost to the host organization or participating children in the many worldwide locations where Keysight does business.

To learn more about Keysight After School and how it might be implemented in your community, contact Keysight Public Affairs Manager Jeff Weber.

Keysight Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

Keysight Technologies, Inc. Announces Executive Changes
Jul 20 17
Keysight Technologies, Inc. announced that effective immediately, Satish Dhanasekaran will succeed Mike Gasparian as president of the Communications Solutions Group. Gasparian, who has chosen to retire, will remain as an advisor through the end of the year to assist with the transition. Keysight also announced the addition of Marie Hattar to its executive team as Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Dhanasekaran, who is currently vice president and general manager of the Wireless Devices and Operators solution unit within the Communications Solutions Group, has held a variety of leadership roles throughout his 21 years in the communications ecosystem. Before being named Keysight’s Chief Marketing Officer, Hattar held that position for Ixia, which was recently acquired by Keysight.


Keysight Technologies Introduces Nano Indenter G200
Jun 20 17
Keysight Technologies, Inc. announced the availability of a high-accuracy tip and sample heater to expand the utility of its popular Nano Indenter G200. This easy-to-use solution uses a precise high-power diode laser to heat the sample and the indenter tip. Benefits include the ability to measure nanomechanical properties at precisely controlled temperatures and to test a wide range of samples under highly dynamic temperature conditions. To ensure reliable data, the system minimizes drift associated with heating by using function-optimized materials and an adjustable laser spot size. Keysight Nano Indenter G200 users also have the option to purge samples with various gases to avoid contamination and oxidation. The new tip and sample heater for the G200 supports a wide temperature range (RT up to 500 C) and is accurate to within 0.1 C. Another advantage is the high rate of the system's heating and cooling processes. Depending on the temperature, the rate can exceed 20 K/sec in either direction. This capability affords scientists and engineers many new and intriguing opportunities for dynamic materials testing. Keysight's laser-heated indenter tip, a critical component of the new system solution, prevents disturbance of the substrate temperature during measurement. This stability is critical for working with materials that have poor thermal conductivity and whose mechanical properties are strongly affected by temperature. Keeping the tip and sample at the same temperature as one another also allows G200 users to perform high-temperature continuous stiffness measurements with exceptional precision. The Nano Indenter G200 system's substrate holder is optimized to provide the highest mechanical and temperature stability. To ensure simple and convenient G200 operation, the transparent plate underneath the sample contains a built-in thermocouple. When the absolute highest accuracy is needed, such as for nanoindentation applications involving thick polymer samples, users can mount a thermocouple to the sample surface. The dual-loop PID controller's NanoSuite interface offers complete NanoSuite software integration.


Keysight Technologies, Inc. Announces Launch of Suite of Test and Measurement Solutions for the Battery, HEV/EV and HEMS Markets
Jun 19 17
Keysight Technologies, Inc. announced the launch of a suite of test and measurement solutions for the battery, HEV/EV and HEMS markets. Keysight’s suite of electric vehicle and HEMS solutions provide design and test engineers powerful, versatile and efficient solutions that will help drive their innovations to market faster, and at a lower cost. EV1003A Power Converter Test Solution – designed specifically to address the efficiency, safety, regulatory and environmental challenges associated with the HEV/EV and HEMS markets. Currently, it’s the only commercial off-the-shelf regenerative power system with highly integrated safety features that protect operators and the devices under test. RP7900 Series Regenerative Power System – offers battery emulation capabilities, such as 2-quadrant (source/sink) operation and programmable output resistance. In addition, the power system provides the added benefit of safely and cleanly regenerating greater than 85% of power back into the grid—which increases efficiency based on reduced energy consumption and cooling requirements. BT2191A Self-Discharge Measurement (SDM) System – for cell designers, the BT2191A SDM system offers a new way to accurately measure Li-Ion cells’ self-discharge currents, within a significantly reduced amount of time and with a settling time as low as one to two hours. This new patented technique allows engineers to dramatically reduce the design cycle-time and helps to optimize self-discharge performance and characteristics of battery cells. BT2152A Self-Discharge Analyzer (SDA) – for Li-Ion cell manufacturers, the BT2152A SDA offers a new type of analyzer that measures in parallel self-discharge currents on a large number of cells, providing a significant reduction in the time required to discern good versus bad cell self-discharge performance. This helps achieve dramatic reductions in work-in-process inventories, working capital and facility costs.

Products[edit]
Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]

Keysight Technologies, or Keysight, is a US company that manufactures test and measurement equipment and software. In 2014, Keysight was spun off from Agilent Technologies, bringing with it the product lines focused on electronics and radio, leaving Agilent with the chemical and bio-analytical products.
The name is a blend of key and insight, and was chosen to convey that the company "unlocks" "critical or key insights."[2][4]

Products[edit]
Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]

Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Keysight Growth Compares To Its Competitors - Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Keysight Growth Compares To Its CompetitorsJun. 9.17 | About: Keysight Technologies (KEYS) Jorge Acrisio Growth at reasonable price, small-capSummaryKeysight reported its second quarter and gives updates in the Ixia acquisition.Revenue's guidance for the next quarter are expected to rise in the range of 17% to 22.5%.The market has reacted negatively due to an increase in long term debt and a higher addition of outstanding shares than expected.Market value remains below its peers, even after a change in valuations.

 Keysight Technologies Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) reported $753 million in revenue coming from the second quarter, meaning a 2.45% growth from last year, and a 3.7% rise from the prior quarter. This result includes only 13 days of revenue from Ixia, an acquisition which was closed in April, and was driven mainly by an increase in the Electronic Industrial Solutions. Revenues have remained almost flat since they started trading as an independent company from Agilent Technologies Inc (NYSE: A) due to a combination of product segments that are delivering growth and others that are lagging. To understand which segment is boosting growth and which one is offsetting it, Keysight presents its results by market segment. The first one is the Communication solution group, which is supporting sales heavily, but also with ups and downs due to the nature of the markets where it serves. This group can be broken down into the commercial communications market, and the aerospace, defense and government market. 

 Source: Information extracted from Keysight Technologies filings.
 For the Commercial communications market, revenue from the 2Q was $256 million, basically the same of what can be observed from previous quarters. These sales are sustained by the 5G and next-generation data center technology manufacturers to whom Keysight provide test and electronic measurement instruments. Sales coming from 5G are countered by a declining spending in wireless 4G, although this trend could be reversed in the next quarter as they recently got selected by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to test 5G chipsets and provide test solutions for protocol and RF validation. On the other hand, aerospace, defense and government market have experienced some weakness in previous quarters coming from Russia and China with lower levels of orders and spending, although it seems to be upholding. Additionally, revenue have been impacted in this marked by soft spending in the U.S. due to delayed budget approvals, and as noted by the executives, is difficult to predict when the flow of funding will return to a steady state. This kind of market is characterized by these setbacks and is subject to government expending which gives an additional risk and uncertainty on future earnings and orders. Although in some quarters have deliver abnormal earnings like in FQ2 on 2016 and boost revenue growth, most of the time lacks of consistency and diminish it. Moving to the Electronic industry solutions group, for the period ended April 30, revenue saw a record high topping for $220 million, a 14% increase from the last year, which improved mostly by the semiconductor measurement solutions and the automotive and energy solutions. Moreover, an interesting incorporation of new key customers for automotive solutions was noted for the period as more suppliers in the industry are shifting to autonomous-driving, which are developing wireless communications, radar and smart battery, being these are areas of strength for Keysight. New orders coming from this key customer could continue lifting this segment for the next quarters.
 Now, about the acquisition of Ixia that closed in April 18, a new operating segment arrays from it named the Ixia Solutions Group, broadening Keysight services in the high-speed data centers by offering network security test and solutions. The incorporated revenues since the acquisition closed was $12 million and orders of $128 million for the full quarter, which are expected to be recognized as revenue over time. Ixia outstanding common stock cost about $1.6 billion or $19.65 per share and was funded through a combination of cash and proceeds from debt and equity financing, giving an increased long term debt of $1.1 billion from the prior quarter. With all this in mind, Keysight faces several challenges in some market segments, which are slowing down revenue growth or have not grown at all. Some of them like Commercial communications, Semiconductor measurement and automotive are showing an increase in sales and some momentum, with future prospect in the long term. The so-called transformation for growth mentioned by the CEO Ronald S. Nersesian come at the hand of Ixia acquisition which will allow to be better positioned and it could take advantage on high-speed datacenters and the 5G technology transition. Growth drivers by competitor Expanding the landscape, there are other key players in the electronic measurement equipment industry, which are listed by Keysight and arrange by market segments. Their major competitors are Fortive, Corp. (NYSE:FTV) and its subsidiaries, National Instruments, Corp. (NASDAQ:NATI), Teledyne Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TDY), and Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE:TER) which are listed in the U.S. 

 Source: Data compiled from several different sources from the SEC Of these competitors, the most capitalized is Fortive, which has enjoyed some momentum in sales since it started trading in June from last year. In the first quarter of 2017 revenue increase 4.1% to $1.5 billion supported by growth on all its platforms and as well by acquisitions. The catalysts that boosted this surge in sales comes from its subsidiaries Tektronix and Gilbarco Veeder-Root which are delivering double digit growth, and as a result, gaining market share in the regions of North America and Western Europe.
 The guidance has been risen given that are feeling confident in its investments and acquisitions, expecting an EPS for the full year of 2017 in a range of $2.68 to $2.78 which includes an assumption of low to mid-single digit core revenue growth. Coming with a similar growth in the same period is National Instruments, and like Keysight, this growth has been inconsistent over periods. The Revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was about $300 million, a 5% improvement from the same period last year, mainly supported by its wireless, semiconductor, and transportation test systems. Looking backwards, the reasons for this disparity in results quarter over quarter is attributed mainly by fluctuations in revenues from its largest customer and the impact of foreign currency exchange. The issues National Instruments faces are pretty specific and come from expense overruns and manufacturing inefficiencies, which in additions to volatility coming from larger orders and clients, has left the company in a state of stagnation in previous quarters. Despite this, the expectation for the 2Q are in the range of $305 million to $335 million in revenue, meaning a 5% increase in the midpoint, which could imply a new run for sales growth coming from its RF products and semiconductor test systems. Another story is Teledyne, which has reported an increase in revenues year over year for the first time in a while, achieved by growth coming from each of its business segments. Teledyne has gone through a significant decline in its marine instrumentation for the past 2 years guided by the energy sector decline in capex and investment in the sensors that are used for exploration and production, this has deteriorated overall sales and offset growth coming from other sectors like digital imaging and the aerospace and defense electronics. Revenues for Teledyne in the first quarter of 2017 were $566 million, a 7% increase YOY and 2.4% from the previous quarter. This result was due to strong performance in its Digital Imaging that grow 26.6% from the last year, delivering $113.8 million alone. Complementary Teledyne portfolio in this segment, is the acquisition of e2v technologies plc that got completed by March 28 on the present year, a company that provides high performance image sensors, custom camera solutions, and application specific standard products in addition to the existing products line. This acquisition has not yet been reflected and is expected to lift full year EPS in the range of $5.76 to $5.86.
 Moving on to Teradyne Inc. Revenue has seen major ups and downs, giving the fact that sales of its products and services are subject to cyclical trends and demand from its customers, who often delays or advance purchases in relation to their business cycles. Teradyne note on its filings that this seasonality impact mainly the Semiconductor Test segment and this tendency could be seen as an even/odd year trend where demand increased in even years and decreased in odd years. Considering all this, Teradyne reported growth in revenues by a 6% YOY or $457 million compare to $431 from a year ago. The drivers for this increase was the Semi Test and Universal Robots markets demand that continue its strong pace from the previous quarter, particularly the first one with a contribution on revenues of 77.7% or $355.5 million. Turning for the next quarters, executives are expecting sales coming into the range of $660 million and $700 million, meaning about a 27% increase from the FQ2'16 in the midpoint as a result of customers that are speeding up orders to get capacity in place sooner than in other years. In the end, it seems that the industry of electronic measurement equipment in general is highly competitive and is having a switch through communication markets and new technologies like 5G, mobile, IoT, 3D sensing, autonomous car, and consumer electronics. Revenue coming from these sources could mean a renovation in terms of growth for those companies investing in it and restructuring to serve these markets, however, this value added will take some time to be capitalized. Market valuation For Keysight, recent results have been discounted negatively probably by an increase in long term debt and also by an addition above than was expected of outstanding shares for the period, causing a dilutive effect, this has led to a change in valuation as ratios has risen, even though, holding lower levels compare to its peers. Also, it seems to be trading at a premium over its 2-year average, as a result of current stability of some of its market segments, especially the aerospace and defense.
 

 Source: Compiled and calculated using information from the SEC and market prices from Google In addition, there has been an increase in activity coming from analyst, in one side, Citigroup initiated coverage on Keysight with a target price of $44 and a recommendation of Buy on May 30. Contrarily, Goldman Sachs reinstated its position of Neutral with a target price of $38 right before the second quarter results. In the outlook, executives announced guidance on revenues coming from the next quarter in the range of $840 million to $880 million, a 19.8% YOY increase in the midpoint and 14% from this quarter. They are feeling confident on their recent acquisition and new partnership with Qualcomm, although it seems that something else is needed to lift the price from what it seems to be a $40 resistance.

Products[edit]
Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]

Keysight Technologies, or Keysight, is a US company that manufactures test and measurement equipment and software. In 2014, Keysight was spun off from Agilent Technologies, bringing with it the product lines focused on electronics and radio, leaving Agilent with the chemical and bio-analytical products.
The name is a blend of key and insight, and was chosen to convey that the company "unlocks" "critical or key insights."[2][4]

Products[edit]
Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]

Keysight Technologies, or Keysight, is a US company that manufactures test and measurement equipment and software. In 2014, Keysight was spun off from Agilent Technologies, bringing with it the product lines focused on electronics and radio, leaving Agilent with the chemical and bio-analytical products.
The name is a blend of key and insight, and was chosen to convey that the company "unlocks" "critical or key insights."[2][4]

Products[edit]
Keysight's products include hardware and software for benchtop, modular, and field instruments.[5] Instruments include oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit testers, power supplies and handheld tools. In addition, it produces electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof division). It mainly serves the telecommunications, aerospace/defense, industrial, computer, and semiconductor industries.[6]
History[edit]
Prior to its existence as an independent company, the group that became Keysight was the electronic test and measurement division of first Hewlett-Packard, and later Agilent. HP began as a company making electronic test equipment, with the computer and life sciences products coming later. In 1999, HP spun-off all test and measurement products into Agilent and retained the computer and printer businesses.[7] On November 1, 2014, the formal separation of Agilent and Keysight Technologies was completed, with Agilent retaining the life science businesses. The separation was implemented through a spinoff of Keysight’s common stock. Agilent shareholders received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent common stock held October 22, 2014.
In June 2015, Keysight announced it would acquire the UK’s Anite PLC in a deal worth £388 million.[8]
In August 2015, Keysight announced the acquisition of the UK’s Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd comprising Electroservices (Midlands) Ltd. and Micro Movements Ltd.[9] Micro Movements Ltd., a bespoke electronic measurement solutions business, was originally incorporated in 1994, with expertise in measurement solutions across a broad range of industry sectors. The company was incorporated into Electroservices Enterprises UK Ltd in 2013.
Keysight was listed in a top 50 India’s best companies to Work for 2015.[10]
On January 30, 2017, Keysight agreed to buy Ixia for about $1.6 billion in all-cash, with the deal expected to close by October 2017.[11][12]
Awards[edit]
Keysight won the 2014 Global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership with $300 million in instrumentation software revenue. The citation states R&D investment of 12% of revenue ($365 million in 2013) as an important factor.[13]
