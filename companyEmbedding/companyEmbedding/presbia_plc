The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the issue of 4,166,667 ordinary shares in
this offering will be approximately $36.7 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriter exercises its option to subscribe for additional
ordinary shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately
$42.5 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $17.0 million to cover the total anticipated remaining costs 
  to advance our microlens and our microlens inserter through our U.S. staged
  pivotal clinical trial;  

. approximately $14.7 million to fund our efforts to expand the number of 
  high-volume refractive laser centers with which we do business;  

. approximately $4.0 million to fund research and development; and  

. approximately $1.0 million to pursue regulatory approvals that we require 
  in the United States and internationally.  

This calculation of net proceeds does not include $3,369,000 of offering costs
that we have expensed in our combined statement of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014.

Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical trial and regulatory approval
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net
proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our
management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this
offering. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the success of our clinical trials, the timing of regulatory
submissions and the amount of cash generated by our international sales.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade
securities or government securities.


The medical device industry in general, and the ophthalmic medical device market
in particular, are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change and
significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of
other participants. Our currently marketed products are, and any future products
we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition.

We expect to compete against companies that are developing corneal inlay
surgical solutions for presbyopia, including AcuFocus, Inc., ReVision Optics,
Inc., Neoptics AG and LensGen, Inc. AcuFocus, Inc.’s corneal inlay approach
attempts to use small aperture optics to reduce distortion by eliminating
peripheral light rays and limiting the width of diverging light rays. ReVision
Optics, Inc.’s corneal inlay approach attempts to produce a smooth variation in
focal power across the pupil by microscopically altering the surface shape of
the cornea. Neoptics AG’s corneal inlay approach consists of a bifocal lens with
a peripheral zone designed to improve near vision and a central zone for
distance vision. LensGen, Inc. is a newer company with little publicly available
information regarding its intraocular lens which is being designed to harness
fluidics and displacement to manipulate curvature to better capture light. Both
AcuFocus, Inc. and ReVision Optics, Inc. have been conducting clinical trials in
the United States for years and have more experience than Presbia in conducting
such trials. AcuFocus, Inc. has completed a pivotal clinical trial in the United
States and is thus further along in the FDA approval process than Presbia. Also,
both AcuFocus, Inc. and ReVision Optics, Inc., like Presbia, have marketing
approval in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, including the EEA,
and can be expected to compete with Presbia in such jurisdictions. We believe
that AcuFocus, Inc. may have more commercial activities to date than Presbia in
certain jurisdictions, including Japan. We do not believe that Neoptics AG has
approval in the U.S. to conduct clinical trials or marketing approval in any
jurisdiction. In addition to being an effective treatment option for presbyopia,
we believe that our microlens is less invasive than ReVision’s Optics, Inc.’s
corneal inlay, offers a range of optical power corrections not offered by
ReVision’s Optics, Inc.’s corneal inlay or AcuFocus, Inc.’s corneal inlay, is
less conspicuous than AcuFocus, Inc.’s corneal inlay and is more easily
removable than ReVision Optics, Inc.’s corneal inlay.

In June 2014, the FDA released data presented by AcuFocus to the FDA in its PMA
submission with respect to its KAMRA device. The data related to a study
conducted by AcuFocus with respect to 508 subjects (of which the FDA determined
that there were 494 evaluable subjects). We reviewed that data against the data
that we compiled from the post-market surveillance study that we conducted in
Italy and Greece in 2012 with respect to 70 patients who underwent implantation
of our microlens.

We note the following with respect to the AcuFocus study and our post-market 
surveillance study: 

. Approximately 80.8% of AcuFocus’ 494 evaluable subjects achieved UCVA-near of 
  20/40 or better in the operated eye 12 months postoperative, which was the 
  primary efficacy endpoint of the AcuFocus study. As discussed elsewhere in 
  this prospectus, approximately 99% of the 70 patients in Presbia’s post-
  market surveillance study achieved UCVA-near of 20/40 or better in the 
  operated eye 12 months postoperative.  

. Both the Kamra, in AcuFocus’ study, and Presbia’s microlens, in Presbia’s 
  post-market surveillance study, generally had minimal effect on a subject’s 
  binocular distance vision.  

. Included among the adverse events in each study at 12 months postoperative, 
  3.0% of subjects experienced device explantations in AcuFocus’ study, and 
  1.4% of subjects experienced device explantations in Presbia’s post-market 
  surveillance study.  

We believe that this comparative information may be useful to potential
investors in assessing our competitive landscape. However, we note that
AcuFocus’ study includes a substantially larger sample size (number of patients
that received the implant) than Presbia’s post-marketing evaluation and that
comparability of the results of AcuFocus’ study and Presbia’s post-marketing
evaluation could also be adversely affected by differences in patient
demographics, such as gender and ethnicity, as well as differences in study
protocols, site location and other conditions. We also note that we are
currently conducting our U.S. staged pivotal clinical trial, and that trial
might provide different results than those observed in our post-market
evaluation described above and elsewhere in this prospectus.

We expect to compete against companies that offer alternative surgical treatment
methodologies, including monovision, multifocal and accommodating approaches,
and companies that promote reading glasses and/or contact lenses as approaches
for responding to presbyopia. At any time, our known competitors and other
potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that
may compete directly with our products. In addition, they may gain a market
advantage by developing and patenting competitive products or processes earlier
than we can or by obtaining regulatory approvals/clearances or market
registrations more rapidly than we can.

Certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater
financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able
to devote greater resources to the development, regulatory approval, promotion,
sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive
customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including
relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies
have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do.
Because of the size of the presbyopia market and the high growth profile of that
market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to
developing competing products. We believe that the principal competitive factors
in our market include:

. improved outcomes for patients and other product quality issues; 

. product innovation; 

. acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons; 

. ease of use and reliability; 

. regulatory status and speed to market; 

. product price and procedure price; and 

. reputation for technical leadership. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our 
competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors.


Company Description
We are an ophthalmic device company that has developed and is currently
marketing a proprietary optical lens implant for treating presbyopia, the
age-related loss of the ability to focus on near objects. Our lens, which we
refer to as our microlens, is a miniature lens designed to be


 surgically
implanted in a patient’s eye to improve that patient’s ability to see objects at
close distances. Our current strategy is to continue to commercialize our
microlens in certain strategic countries where we currently have marketing
approval and to continue to seek to obtain marketing approval in other key
markets, including the United States. Our goal is to become a leading provider
of corneal inlay presbyopia-correcting treatment worldwide.

According to Market Scope’s 2013 Comprehensive Report on The Global Presbyopia
Surgery Market, or the Market Scope Report, presbyopia is a common vision
disorder that affects approximately 1.8 billion people worldwide. Presbyopia is
associated with the inability of the eye’s natural lens to change shape, or
accommodate, in order to see clearly objects in the near and middle distance
ranges. According to the Market Scope Report, the worldwide presbyopic
population is expected to grow to approximately 2.0 billion by 2018 and 2.1
billion by 2020. According to the Market Scope Report, spending on devices,
equipment and procedure fees for presbyopia-correcting surgery is expected to
increase from approximately $448 million in 2012 to approximately $1.2 billion
in 2018 at the manufacturer level. We do not have marketing approval in many
jurisdictions included in the foregoing global data, which jurisdictions
collectively represent a majority of the worldwide presbyopic population. We
have marketing approval in a number of strategic countries that we are targeting
for commercialization and we are actively seeking marketing approval in certain
other strategic countries that we are targeting for commercialization, including
the United States.

While reading glasses and contact lenses have historically been, and remain, the
most common solution for presbyopia, there are significant drawbacks associated
with these approaches, as well as with alternative surgical approaches. We
believe that our microlens provides an alternative solution to those presbyopic
individuals who desire greater freedom from glasses and wish to avoid the daily
maintenance and other complications of contact lenses. In addition, we believe
that ophthalmologists are generally reluctant to recommend a laser in-situ
keratomileusis, or LASIK, procedure or lens replacement procedure (whereby the
natural lens is replaced with an intraocular lens, or IOL, implant) as a
solution for plano presbyopes, or those individuals who suffer from presbyopia
but do not have any other visual disorder, given the inherent risks and visual
compromises of such procedures. Plano presbyopes represent approximately 38% of
the presbyopic population, making plano presbyopes the largest sub-group of
presbyopes. Because our solution does not involve the removal of the natural
lens, the reshaping of the cornea or the removal of corneal tissue, we believe
that ophthalmologists may be more likely to recommend our microlens as a
solution for plano presbyopes than a LASIK or IOL procedure.

In addition to being an effective standalone treatment for presbyopia, we
believe that our solution can also be used in conjunction with other surgical
approaches that are used to treat vision disorders other than presbyopia. For
example, we believe that our microlens procedure can be combined with LASIK
procedures in order to treat those presbyopes who also suffer from a refractive
disorder commonly treated with a LASIK procedure, such as myopia, or the
inability to focus on distant objects (nearsightedness), hyperopia, or the
inability to focus on near objects (farsightedness), and astigmatism (an optical
defect which causes blurred vision). We also believe that our microlens
procedure can be combined with IOL procedures to treat those presbyopes who also
have cataracts. In addition, we believe that our microlens can be used to treat
presbyopia in certain post-LASIK and post-cataract surgery patients. We believe
that, having undergone refractive eye surgery in the past, such patients are
more likely than the general population to consider eye surgery to treat
presbyopia. Moreover, as we believe that our solution can be performed at the
same time that certain other forms of vision-correction treatments are
performed, we believe that our solution provides an integrated treatment option
for patients and an additional source of revenue for the patient’s ophthalmic
surgeon. In this way, we believe that our solution complements existing surgical
treatments for vision problems.

We believe that our solution also offers each of the following benefits:

. our solution is minimally invasive; our microlens can be implanted and 
  removed in a simple, surgical procedure;  

. we believe that our solution offers significant near vision improvement 
  with little or no loss of binocular distance visual acuity (the ability to 
  see distant objects with both eyes without prescription enhancement) and 
  minimal risk of adverse side effects;  

. our solution offers a wide range of corrective power, from +1.5 diopters 
  to +3.5 diopters, in 0.25 diopter increments (a diopter is a unit of 
  measurement of the optical power of a lens); and  

. once implanted, our microlens is invisible to the naked eye.  

In 2012, we completed a 12-month, multicenter, post-marketing evaluation in
Italy and Greece of our microlens in presbyopic patients between the ages of 45
and 60. We designed, and oversaw the implementation of, the protocol for this
evaluation, which was conducted at our request by a surgeon at the
Vardinoyannion Eye Institute of the University of Crete in Crete, Greece and by
a surgeon at Prato Hospital in Prato, Italy. The 12-month data for the 70
patients who completed the study generally demonstrated successful patient
outcomes measured in terms of improvement in near-distance visual acuity (the
ability to see close objects). The average uncorrected near visual acuity (the
ability to see close objects without prescription enhancement), or UCVA-near, in
the operated eye of the 70 patients who completed the study was 20/110
pre-surgery and 99% of those patients started the study with UCVA-near in the
operated eye of 20/50 or worse. Following implantation with our microlens, such
patients had an average UCVA-near of 20/27 12 months post-surgery, 99% of such
patients completed the study with 20/40 or better UCVA-near in the operated eye
and 70% of such patients completed the study with 20/25 or better UCVA-near in
the operated eye. Although there was a slight loss in uncorrected distance
visual acuity (the ability to see distant objects without prescription
enhancement), or UCVA-distance, in the operated eye, there was no significant
change in binocular UCVA-distance (UCVA-distance when using both eyes) from
before treatment to after treatment in this study. Our microlens has also been
the subject of certain third party studies. We did not commission these studies
or design, review or oversee the implementation of their protocols, and we have
limited information with respect to these studies.

Our microlens procedure is performed using a 150 kilohertz or greater frequency
femtosecond laser, which is a laser that is currently used in certain LASIK
surgeries, cataract surgeries and cornea replacement surgeries. In
commercializing our solution, we intend to target those markets with a
well-established presence of high-volume refractive laser centers equipped with
femtosecond lasers. We believe that the existing infrastructure in most such
laser centers is sufficient to make our solution an attractive opportunity for
such laser centers and will also minimize our anticipated capital investment in
equipment and training in connection with our commercialization efforts. Our
commercialization strategy includes working closely with such laser centers to
train and qualify ophthalmic surgeons on the use of our solution.

Through our European Union CE Mark, we are generally authorized to market our
microlens throughout the European Economic Area (27 of the 28 European Union
member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA, and Switzerland.
We currently market our microlens in certain strategic EEA countries as well as
certain strategic countries outside of the EEA in which we possess marketing
approval. Through the filing date of the registration statement of which this
prospectus forms a part, ophthalmic surgeons have implanted over 600 of our
microlenses outside of the United States.

We are presently seeking marketing approval in other strategic countries,
including the United States. In December 2013, we received approval to commence
a staged pivotal clinical trial as part of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, approval process. Beginning in May 2014, we enrolled a
total of 75 subjects at six investigational sites in the United States.
Beginning in June 2014, these subjects underwent insertion of our microlens in
the non-dominant eye. Based on six-month data on 52 subjects, on January 8, 2015
we submitted an interim safety report to the FDA as a supplement to our
investigational device exemption, or IDE. If the FDA finds no safety concerns,
we anticipate the FDA will permit us to continue enrollment and to increase the
study population size and the number of investigational sites conducting our
clinical study. We are targeting enrollment of an additional 337 subjects, for a
total of 412 subjects, at up to 10 investigational sites in the United States.
This study is necessary in order to obtain clinical data to provide the primary
support for a safety and effectiveness evaluation to support a pre-market
approval, or PMA, for marketing clearance in the United States. Data on a
minimum of 300 subjects with 24-month data will be submitted as part of the PMA,
and all subjects will be followed for three years following implantation.
Assuming the FDA finds no safety concerns in our interim safety report, we are
targeting approval from the FDA to continue enrollment in our study in the first
or second quarter of 2015. We are targeting submission of our final PMA to the
FDA with 24-month data on 300 subjects in the second quarter of 2017. We are
pursuing a modular PMA submission strategy whereby we intend to submit to the
FDA information regarding preclinical testing, engineering, and manufacturing in
the fourth quarter of 2015 or first quarter of 2016, prior to the submission of
our final PMA. We are targeting PMA approval of our microlens in the fourth
quarter of 2017. We are also targeting submission to the FDA of a final report
with 36-month data on these 300 subjects in the second quarter of 2018. These
milestones could be delayed by further interactions with the FDA or by a variety
of other factors. In addition, no assurance can be given that the FDA will grant
us PMA approval or, if granted, that it will be granted in accordance with our
anticipated time schedule. Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-approval
studies as a condition of approval. We expect to use approximately $17 million
of the net proceeds of this offering to cover the total anticipated remaining
costs to advance our microlens and our microlens inserter through our U.S.
staged pivotal clinical trial. The proceeds from this offering are expected to
be sufficient to fund our general operations through the completion of our U.S.
staged pivotal clinical trial.

To achieve our goal of becoming a leading provider of corneal inlay
presbyopia-correcting treatment worldwide, we are pursuing the following
strategies:

. rapidly expand commercialization outside the United States in countries 
  where our CE Mark is recognized as well as in other countries where our 
  microlens is approved;  

. continue to select medical centers already equipped with the necessary 
  laser equipment as initial commercialization targets, thus limiting the 
  capital investment required by our physician partners and providing us with 
  an existing, potential customer base;  

. advance our microlens through a staged pivotal U.S. clinical trial; and  

. provide training and education to key opinion leaders, including respected 
  ophthalmologists.  

In addition, our microlens and the procedure to implant our microlens are not 
currently reimbursed through private or governmental third-party payors in any 
country, nor do we anticipate that they will be reimbursable in the foreseeable 
future. Although the commercialization of our microlens depends on a 
prospective patient’s ability to cover the costs of our microlens and the 
implantation procedure and we believe that a substantial portion of presbyopes 
worldwide do not have the financial means to cover the costs of our microlens, 
we believe that a direct patient pay model enables medical providers to avoid 
pricing pressure from private or governmental third-party payors.
