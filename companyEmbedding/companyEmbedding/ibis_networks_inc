Ibis Plug Load Management System

    The Ibis Networks plug load management system is comprised of three parts – InteliSocket meters, InteliGateways, and the InteliNetwork.  These work seamlessly together to give you real-time data and control over your electrical equipment.




InteliSocket™

InteliSockets are the local energy meters and control points. They easily plug in between your equipment and the wall sockets.
Learn More 



InteliGateway™

InteliGateways are the connection points between InteliSockets and the InteliNetwork. They securely handle all communications between the two.
Learn More 



InteliNetwork™

The InteliNetwork is a cloud-based reporting and control dashboard. It provides advanced data visualization, scheduling, and configuration capabilities.

InteliGateway™





The Ibis InteliGateway is the central connection point between the InteliSockets and the InteliNetwork. As the InteliSocket mesh network reports energy usage data on devices every 15 seconds, the InteliGateway collects all the reports and passes them along to the cloud-based InteliNetwork in real time. The InteliGateway also takes commands from the InteliNetwork for powering devices up/down, and passes those commands along to the correct InteliSockets, then confirms the response to the InteliNetwork.
Along with plug load data, the InteliGateway sends information about its health and internal state. This data feeds into the InteliNetwork’s alert system, and can be immediately broadcast to support technicians if a situation arises that needs attention.
The InteliGateway adapts to local environmental issues to robustly deliver plug load data from each socket to the InteliNetwork. The InteliGateway aggregates and caches plug load data in the case of connectivity problems and easily accommodates being disconnected for up to 30 minutes. The InteliGateway automatically restarts after a power outage and has internal sensors that can identify an error state, automatically restarting when the error is non-recoverable.

BMS Integration
The InteliGateway can also be configured to communicate with building management systems (BMS) that support BACNet IP communications. This provides two-way data and command control between the InteliNetwork system and the BMS. This allows companies to use a BMS for holistic and coordinated building controls, while still taking advantage of the data reporting and other tools in the cloud-based InteliNetwork.

Schools and Higher Education









In schools, there are many opportunities to use the Ibis InteliNetwork to provide insight and save money. Typical equipment that schools have had success with include:

Computers
Charging carts
Refrigerators
Kitchen equipment
Water coolers and fountains
Projectors
Window AC units
Copiers and printers
Space heaters



Schools consume enormous amounts of energy. Every year, K-12 schools spend over $8 Billion on energy - more than they spend on textbooks and computers combined. However, Energy Star estimates that at least 30% ($2.4 Billion) of this is wasted.
            
For most schools, 25-30% of the total electricity is consumed by plug load - all the equipment, computers, refrigerators, projectors, etc. that are plugged in around campus.
            
With Ibis, schools can take control of this consumption and dramatically reduce this energy cost. These savings can be spent on education, deferred maintenance, and other important needs.
How Ibis Saves Energy and Money in Schools
Using a holistic approach that employs multiple strategies can save a school upwards of 10-15% on its overall electricity bill.  Key strategies that Ibis InteliNetwork systems enable include:

Schedules Shut down equipment when spaces are unoccupied, and ensure that devices such as heaters, fans, and air conditioners aren’t accidentally left on.
                
Device Health Know when to repair or replace equipment, extending life of equipment (e.g., refrigerators).
Informed Policies Create and enforce behavioral policies, such as powering down unused computers, that encourage energy savings
Time Shifting Charge or run equipment like charging carts during off-peak hours to save money.
Alerts Get alerts when key equipment is on or off when it should not be.

Additionally, the InteliNetwork can be used to further work force development and student engagement.

InteliNetwork™





As the heart of the system, the InteliNetwork is the primary interface and tool for viewing, analyzing, reporting, and managing your building’s plug load data.
The Ibis InteliNetwork is a cloud-based service that provides reporting, scheduling, data analytics, and system management tools. The highly intuitive, yet powerful system allows users to identify opportunities for energy and demand reduction, implement energy management strategies through device scheduling and monitoring, and track savings in real time.
The InteliNetwork is accessible from any connected device, and is built from the ground-up to support mobile devices, tablets, and other devices.
Dashboard
 Users can configure the InteliNetwork to provide targeted, high-value information at a glance. The dashboard provides office workers with individualized access: allowing them to control sockets in their personal workspace; provide technical support staff with up-to-date access to device health information and real-time notifications; and ensure that financial people always have up-to-date data on energy use and savings.
 
Reporting
The core of any energy management strategy is detailed energy usage data. The InteliNetwork software displays historical data at granularities as fine as one minute and as coarse as multiple days. The dynamic display allows one to look at short time intervals at extremely fine detail as easily as summary data for years at a time.
Usage data can be split up by individual sockets, or grouped by location or device type. Whichever way the data is aggregated, it can be displayed in a stacked format to show the components of the total energy usage, or in a side-by-side format to compare energy use from one socket to another, one device type to another, or from one location to another.
 
 
Scheduling
Meta-data and analytical calculations can be overlaid on the data display to contextualize the data and highlight derived data attributes that can inform energy strategies. Analytical results can also be used to estimate savings of potential device schedules.
 
Alerts
A flexible and extensible alerting system provides immediate notification of high-priority error conditions, as well as regular summary reports of system activity. Notifications and reports can be routed to email and SMS according to priority and content.
Administrative Tools
A fine-grained permissions system limits data visibility by user according to location and device type. Separate permissions independently control what data a user can view and which socket the user has control over. Control of critical devices can be globally disallowed.

Office Buildings









Offices are diverse environments, but there are many common devices where Ibis can help:

Computers
Copiers and printers
Space heaters
Water coolers/heaters/fountains
Projectors
Kitchen equipment
Displays and lobby equipment



Most office buildings are empty over 60% of the time, including nights and weekends, but much of the equipment inside continues to run 24/7. Equipment like water coolers, space heaters, printers, copiers, vending machines, and refrigerators all use energy when no one is around. Even in power-saving mode, the total energy wasted by all this equipment adds up.
In fact, “plug load” equipment comprises 25-40% of a building’s overall electricity usage, but building managers have no tools to manage or even understand this huge demand.
In addition, without active monitoring and data on the equipment energy usage, it is impossible to know if the devices are performing at their best or even energy efficient in the first place.
With Ibis Networks, you finally get real-time data on energy usage for every piece of equipment, easy-to-use controls to implement power schedules and policies, and alerts to keep you in control.  All delivered through an intuitive cloud-based dashboard. It even can integrate with your BACnet building management system.
How Ibis Saves Energy and Money in Office Buildings
Office buildings that take an active management approach to plug load can save up to 40% on managed devices, which translates into 8-10% off the overall electricity bill.
Key strategies that Ibis InteliNetwork systems enable include:

Schedules Easily create dynamic schedules to power down equipment when the office is empty. The Ibis system can be used to set schedules by department, location, type, or even for each individual device.
Device Health Energy usage can be a predictor of device health. Erratic or excessive energy use often precedes device failure. Using Ibis real-time data, you can see which equipment needs maintenance or replacement before it fails.
Informed Policies Use trend and energy cost data to optimize user behavior policies. For example, turning off computers or lobby equipment can increase savings quickly.
Alerts Get notified when equipment is on or off when it should not be. For mission critical equipment, this can be more valuable than the other benefits combined!
