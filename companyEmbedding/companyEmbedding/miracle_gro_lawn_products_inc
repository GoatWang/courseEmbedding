Your Complete Lawn and Garden Headquarters














Lowe’s is your one-stop shop for all your outdoor, landscaping, and yard needs. If you’re looking for lawn care, look no further. We have a huge selection of push lawn mowers, including popular walk-behind mowers and self-propelled lawn mowers. And if you have a big yard with a lot of grass, we have just the riding lawn mower for you. Finish off the lawn with the precision of string trimmers or lawn edgers. And don’t forget the grass seeds. For the rest of your yard, we have all the landscaping tools you’ll need, such as hedge trimmers, leaf blowers, chainsaws, weed eaters, log splitters, lawn aerators, pressure washers and portable generators.
Looking to do some hardscaping to your yard? We have the right pavers, rocks, edging stones and wood to aid your landscape design. With our help, you’ll be on your way to creating stone pathways, raised garden beds, retaining walls, fencing and anything else you can imagine. Choose from a variety of fire pits, grills and tiki torches to finish off your look. 
When it comes to gardening, make sure to water and feed your flowers and plants. Our selection of seeds and bulbs, fertilizer, mulches and soils – like topsoil or potting soil – will have your yard looking green in no time. Looking for a vegetable garden? Consider a hydroponic garden system that produces fresh food year round. The Lowe's Garden Center can help make your garden your own by adding perennial flowers, annual flowers or shrubs. Have kids? Lay down playground mulch or rubber mulch to create a safer playing surface. We also carry a lot of gardening tools, such as rakes, hoes, shovels and axes.
Unfortunately, every lawn and garden attracts insects and unwanted pests. That’s why we offer lawn insect control, garden insect control, mosquito control and home insect control. We also offer specific pest control options, such as fire ant killers, bug sprays, mosquito repellents, termite treatments and mousetraps. A shed is a great way to store all your lawn and garden equipment. We carry vinyl and resin sheds, metals sheds and wood sheds. And if you’re a bird lover, check out our assortment of bird feeders.

Better Know a Marijuana Stock: Scotts Miracle-Gro
This lawn and garden company has a new trick up its sleeve. 











                Sean Williams
            

                (TMFUltraLong)



            
            Jul 7, 2017 at 8:03AM
            
            





Few industries pack the long-term growth potential that comes along with legal pot, which is a very big reason why marijuana stock investors have been flocking to the "green rush." We certainly don't have to look for too long to find robust growth estimates for legal pot.
Cannabis research firm ArcView is forecasting that North American legal sales will more than triple from $6.9 billion in 2016 to nearly $22 billion by 2021. Investment firm Cowen & Co. has taken things a bit further. It's calling for $50 billion in legal cannabis sales in the U.S. by 2026. This would essentially assume a national legalization of the drug, given that an estimated $46.4 billion in North American sales last year were conducted on the black market, per ArcView. The ability to steadily transition consumers from the black market to legal channels is what provides the marijuana industry and pot stocks with such a robust long-term growth opportunity.

However, there are dozens of marijuana stocks to choose from, and emotions surrounding the industry run high. In other words, investors might be buying into marijuana stocks without fully understanding the risks involved.
With this in mind, we're taking the time to analyze one marijuana stock each week until we've covered all of the major players with a market cap of at least $200 million. Here are the marijuana stocks we've discussed so far:

GW Pharmaceuticals
Insys Therapeutics
Aphria
Aurora Cannabis
Canopy Growth Corp.
Corbus Pharmaceuticals
Cara Therapeutics
Zynerba Pharmaceuticals
Axim Biotechnologies
Medical Marijuana, Inc.
Arena Pharmaceuticals
MedReleaf

Today, we're going to take a closer look at Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG).
What Scotts Miracle-Gro does
For many consumers, Scotts Miracle-Gro is a familiar name, as it's one of the largest lawn and garden care companies on the planet. Its primary goal for well over a century has been to help consumers fertilize their lawns and improve their gardens and landscaping. You'll often find its products under the Scotts, Turf Builder, Ortho, Roundup, or Miracle-Gro brand names; the company has well over three dozen brand-name products in its portfolio.
Where the company gets its marijuana stock association is through a subsidiary, Hawthorne Gardening. This subsidiary provides products geared at Scotts' burgeoning hydroponics business (i.e., growing plants without soil). Cannabis, specifically medical cannabis, can be grown via hydroponics.

Promise and opportunities
As you can already guess where this is going, the most intriguing growth opportunity at the moment for Scotts Miracle-Gro is the hydroponics side of its business. Scotts has long been focused on improving plant growth for consumers and businesses, and the expansion of medical and even recreational cannabis is opening the door for its subsidiary Hawthorne Gardening to provide soil, nutrient, lighting, and hydroponic solutions to aid in the growth and yield of medical marijuana crops. Though the legal pot industry may be more or less nascent, Scotts has plenty of expertise in improving yield, which makes it a potential leader in soil, nutrients, and lighting needs.
It's important to note that Hawthorne is mostly growing inorganically at present. It gobbled up General Hydroponics in 2015, and bought a majority interest in Gavita the following year. Scotts' CEO Jim Hagedorn suggested recently that much smaller mom-and-pop-type acquisitions are also in the works, but that they usually take longer to finalize since family-owned companies can be a bit of logistical challenge to incorporate into Scotts' larger business. The addition of these family-owned enterprises should further kick Hawthorne's sales growth into high gear. Entering June 2017, year-to-date sales for Hawthorne were up a blistering 17%, compared to estimated sales growth for the entire company of just 3% to 4% this year. 
Yet Scotts' core business of lawn and gardening care is also what makes this marijuana stock so appealing. The company is only generating around 10% of its total sales from its fast-growing hydroponics business. The remainder of its sales come from its traditional lawn and garden business. Though this business is susceptible to economic fluctuations and weather patterns, it also provides a legitimate fallback for investors should the federal government tighten marijuana regulations. In other words, this ship isn't sinkable if the marijuana industry encounters problems, which isn't the case for most pot stocks.

Risks and concerns
Unlike most marijuana stocks, Scotts Miracle-Gro is consistently profitable, so that's one thing that its investors don't have to worry about. Nonetheless, there are risks and concerns to be wary of.
To begin with, the federal government could indeed put the kibosh on the legal U.S. pot industry at any time if it wanted to, which would crush Scotts' fastest-growing segment. We have to remember that marijuana is still a Schedule I drug at the federal level. This means that pot, like LSD and heroin, has no recognized medical benefits and is entirely illegal. The federal government has, thus far, been willing to keep a hands-off approach to legal marijuana, delegating the responsibility of overseeing and regulating legal cannabis to the individual states that approve it. However, White House press secretary Sean Spicer commented in February that this administration likely wouldn't be so lax on marijuana, which means a tightening in regulations could be forthcoming. That would be bad news for Scotts Miracle-Gro.
Valuation is another concern that should be monitored. Scotts isn't exactly trading in nosebleed territory at roughly 21 times its estimated full-year EPS in 2017, but it recently saw its stock explode higher despite issuing a profit warning. The entire reason its share price jumped was based on growth from its Hawthorne Gardening subsidiary, while investors ignored weakness in its core lawn and garden business. Still, we need to remember that 90% of Scotts' revenue is derived from its traditional businesses. If investors place too much emphasis on its smaller, faster-growing hydroponics business, we could see Scotts' valuation rise to an unsustainable level, leading to an increase in the stock's volatility.
It's also likely that Scotts won't remain the only large player in hydroponics if more states begin legalizing recreational marijuana. Hawthorne's sales growth rate is probably going to slow from its year-to-date 17% in the years to come.

Should you buy Scotts Miracle-Gro?
Now for the all-important question: Should you buy Scotts Miracle-Gro?
On one hand, there's something extremely comforting about having a legitimate lawn and garden business to cushion it if its marijuana-based efforts don't work out. Hagedorn seems to believe that cannabis can be a growth driver for Scotts for years to come, but investors in Scotts should be well protected from downside by the company's core lawn and garden operations.
On the other hand, Scotts has already seen a healthy appreciation in its share price on account of growth in its hydroponics division. The only other state to have made an effort since the November elections to legalize medical or recreational marijuana was Vermont, but its governor vetoed the recreational cannabis bill that made its way to his desk. In short, expansion isn't a guarantee, but it's very much needed to keep up Hawthorne's torrid organic growth rate.
My personal opinion is if you do you want to dip your toe into the water with marijuana stocks, a company like Scotts Miracle-Gro is the way to do it. The company is profitable and it provides a fallback just in case the legal marijuana experiment hits a snag. This doesn't mean Scotts is going to be right for every investor, but it's certainly worth a closer look for those who want to take advantage of growth in the legal pot industry.

Your Complete Lawn and Garden Headquarters














Lowe’s is your one-stop shop for all your outdoor, landscaping, and yard needs. If you’re looking for lawn care, look no further. We have a huge selection of push lawn mowers, including popular walk-behind mowers and self-propelled lawn mowers. And if you have a big yard with a lot of grass, we have just the riding lawn mower for you. Finish off the lawn with the precision of string trimmers or lawn edgers. And don’t forget the grass seeds. For the rest of your yard, we have all the landscaping tools you’ll need, such as hedge trimmers, leaf blowers, chainsaws, weed eaters, log splitters, lawn aerators, pressure washers and portable generators.
Looking to do some hardscaping to your yard? We have the right pavers, rocks, edging stones and wood to aid your landscape design. With our help, you’ll be on your way to creating stone pathways, raised garden beds, retaining walls, fencing and anything else you can imagine. Choose from a variety of fire pits, grills and tiki torches to finish off your look. 
When it comes to gardening, make sure to water and feed your flowers and plants. Our selection of seeds and bulbs, fertilizer, mulches and soils – like topsoil or potting soil – will have your yard looking green in no time. Looking for a vegetable garden? Consider a hydroponic garden system that produces fresh food year round. The Lowe's Garden Center can help make your garden your own by adding perennial flowers, annual flowers or shrubs. Have kids? Lay down playground mulch or rubber mulch to create a safer playing surface. We also carry a lot of gardening tools, such as rakes, hoes, shovels and axes.
Unfortunately, every lawn and garden attracts insects and unwanted pests. That’s why we offer lawn insect control, garden insect control, mosquito control and home insect control. We also offer specific pest control options, such as fire ant killers, bug sprays, mosquito repellents, termite treatments and mousetraps. A shed is a great way to store all your lawn and garden equipment. We carry vinyl and resin sheds, metals sheds and wood sheds. And if you’re a bird lover, check out our assortment of bird feeders.

We use industry standard Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) to encrypt your personal and credit card information during the order checkout process. We do not provide customer viewing of credit card information online. After 90 days, credit card information is permanently deleted from our database. Only authorized personnel are able to access your credit card information, otherwise only the last four digits are displayed.

International Orders

Placing orders for delivery internationally is quick and easy!
The majority of our items can be shipped internationally. Our system will be able to calculate your shipping charges when you enter the country and the postal code on our website. Duty, tax and customs fees will not be included in your shopping cart. Feel free to call us at 877-289-9760 or e-mail us at sales@lifeandhome.com with any questions that you may have.
Lead-Time - The average delivery times posted on our website are for orders shipping within the contiguous United States.

Please note that we do not currently offer expedited shipping to international orders.
Returns and Refunds – We ship all international orders DDU (delivered duty unpaid), and we do not collect VAT (value added taxes). All taxes, duties, and customs fees are the responsibility of the recipient of the package(s).

If you would like to have an order shipped outside of the United States or Canada, please e-mail us with the following information:
·         A link to the product page(s) or the Catalog Id number(s) of the item(s) you wish the order (found underneath the product name on the product page).

We use industry standard Secure Socket Layer software (SSL) to encrypt your personal and credit card information during the order checkout process. We do not provide customer viewing of credit card information online. After 90 days, credit card information is permanently deleted from our database.

International Orders

Placing orders for delivery internationally is quick and easy!
The majority of our items can be shipped internationally. Our system will be able to calculate your shipping charges when you enter the country and the postal code on our website. Duty, tax and customs fees will not be included in your shopping cart. Feel free to call us at 877-289-9760 or e-mail us at sales@lifeandhome.com with any questions that you may have.
Lead-Time - The average delivery times posted on our website are for orders shipping within the contiguous United States. Most orders shipping internationally will have increased transit time due to customs inspections when they arrive at the delivering country. Please note that we do not currently offer expedited shipping to international orders.
Returns and Refunds – We ship all international orders DDU (delivered duty unpaid), and we do not collect VAT (value added taxes). All taxes, duties, and customs fees are the responsibility of the recipient of the package(s). Though we cannot predict what your particular charges will be, you can contact your local customs office for more information regarding your country's customs policies.  
If you would like to have an order shipped outside of the United States or Canada, please e-mail us with the following information:
·         A link to the product page(s) or the Catalog Id number(s) of the item(s) you wish the order (found underneath the product name on the product page).
·         The total quantity you wish to order.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
