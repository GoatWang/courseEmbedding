(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein and in our 2014 Form 10-K, along with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in the 2014 Form 10-K. Any capitalized terms used but not defined in the following discussion have the same meaning given to them in the 2014 Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this discussion to Notes are to the Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Our discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors under Item 1A of Part II of this report and under Item 1A of the 2014 Form 10-K, along with the cautionary discussion about forward looking statements at the end of this section, for information about the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than the results expressed or implied in our forward looking statements.  OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Table of Contents  Revenues. Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2015, totaled $688 thousand, compared to $1,907 thousand for the prior year period, a decrease of 64%. The $1,219 thousand decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased realized pricing per barrel due to the decline in WTI, the relevant oil price benchmark.  CORPORATE EVENTS  NASDAQ Listing Requirements  HIGHLIGHTS OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES  Table of Contents  Poplar (Montana, USA)  United Kingdom  Table of Contents  HH-1 will be put on a production test from the Portland Sandstone section in calendar year 2015 pending regulatory approvals. Pursuant to a farmout agreement executed in December 2013, Magellan owns a 35% working interest in the HH-1 well and is being carried for its share of well costs through testing and completion. With respect to P1916, there was no activity during the three months ended March 31, 2015, and no further activity is planned during fiscal year 2015. In April 2015, the Company sold for nominal consideration its 40% interest in PEDL 126, the exploration license that contains the Markwells Wood-1 wellbore ("MW-1"). By selling the license and the wellbore, the Company will be able to eliminate as of June 30, 2015, $346 thousand of current asset retirement obligation liability related to MW-1 recorded on its balance sheet at March 31, 2015. Concomitantly, approximately $296 thousand of costs related to MW-1 included in wells in progress as of March 31, 2015 will be charged to operations during the three month period ending June 30, 2015.  Australia  CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Uses of Funds  Table of Contents  Capital Expenditure Plans. At Poplar, the Company does not face significant mandatory capital expenditure requirements to maintain its acreage position. Substantially all of the leases are held by production and contain producing wells with reserves adequate to sustain multi-year production. Approximately 80% of the acreage has been unitized as a federal exploratory unit, which is held by economic production from any one well in the unit. Currently, Poplar contains 36 productive wells.  Sources of Funds  Table of Contents  Due to the international components of its operations, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks and certain legal and tax constraints in matching the capital needs of its assets and its cash resources. To the extent that the Company repatriates cash amounts from MPUK to the US, the Company is potentially liable for incremental US Federal and State Income Tax, which may be reduced by the US Federal and State net operating loss and foreign tax credit carry forwards available to the Company at that time.  Existing Credit Facilities. A summary of the Company's existing credit facilities is as follows:   March 31, June 30, 2015 2014 (In thousands) Outstanding borrowings: Line of credit $ 3,501 $ - Total $ 3,501 $ -  The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary NP, maintains a line of credit note (the "LCN") with West Texas State Bank ("WTSB"). As of March 31, 2015, $3,501 thousand of the total available $8,000 thousand LCN was drawn and $4,499 thousand remained available to borrow. The LCN will mature on September 30, 2015, and is subject to quarterly floating interest payments based on the Prime Rate (currently approximately 3.25%) and a floor rate of 3.25%. The LCN is secured by substantially all of NP's assets including a first lien on NP's oil and gas leases from the surface to the top of the Bakken, but excluding any rights to assets within or below the Bakken. Magellan, the parent entity of NP, provided a guarantee of the LCN secured by a pledge of its membership interest in NP. Magellan and NP are subject to certain customary restrictive covenants under the terms of the LCN. As of March 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. As of May 13, 2015, the outstanding balance on the LCN totaled $5,500 thousand. The Company is currently in discussions with WTSB to convert the LCN to a term loan before the maturity date. If the Company is unable to obtain such conversion, the Company plans to repay the outstanding balance with expected proceeds from the contemplated sale of certain of its assets.  Sales of Registered Equity Facilities. On December 24, 2014, the Company implemented an "at-the-market" (ATM) facility under which the Company can raise up to $10 million through the issuance of new common shares into the market. The ATM facility is registered under the Company's "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 17, 2014, and which went effective on December 3, 2014. The Shelf registers the issuance of up to $100 million in equity securities of the Company and is effective through December 2017.  May 15, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Tellurian Investments was founded as a private company on February 23, 2016 by Charif Souki and Martin Houston. On February 10, 2017, it merged with Magellan Petroleum and became a public company known as Tellurian Inc., and listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol TELL.
Tellurian is led by President and CEO Meg Gentle.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
