Detoxification












If you scan the magazine racks next to the checkout in the grocery store, you're likely to see at least a couple issues offering you the latest detox diet.  Detox diets have become popular for all sorts of people, from celebrities to your friends and neighbors.  it seems like for every affliction, from obesity to cancer, there's a specialty detox diet that claims to help.  most of these detox diets involve very low-calorie offerings with just minimal fruits and vegetables, water, and maybe some additional supplements.  The idea behind these diets is that they quickly rid your body of all toxins, so your metabolism gets the boost it needs to fight off disease or help you lose those extra pounds.   The truth is ...

	  		Do I Need To Lose Weight?	  	




Published in

Weight Loss












Let's start off by understanding a little bit about "weight" ...
Healthy Weight
There is no single, definitive "ideal" weight that is appropriate for everyone; Our bodies come in all different sizes, body types, and with different genetic predispositions.  what is an appropriate weight for you is not necessarily the appropriate weight for another person.  That is why at Essential Health Solutions we approach weight loss from a perspective that takes a person's total health and wellness into account: we look for your "healthy weight".
A tall, big-boned person with a slow metabolism, for example, will have a much higher healthy weight than a short, wiry person with a fast metabolism.  And if the first individual successfully slimmed themselves down to the weight of the second individual, they might be thinner, but they would by no means be healthier.
Because of this, comparing just your weight itself to another person's, pound for pound gives us no clear indication of where you fall in relation to your optimal healthy weight.
Instead when assessing your current weight in relation to your optimal healthy weight, there are three predominant factors that we take into account:

Percentage Body Fat
Waist-To-Hip Ratio
Body Mass Index

These tools allow for a far healthier and useful evaluation.
An honest and realistic approach to losing weight must be in line with identifying and achieving one's healthy weight, not with trying to look like a movie star.
At each progress visit you have at Essential Health Solutions, we will calculate your body fat percentage and BMI to keep track of the progress you make in your weight loss efforts.  We will also calculate your waist-to-hip ratio in order to regularly assess your risk (and the potential diagnoses) of any weight-related health concerns.
Let's take a closer look at the factors we take into account while making an assessment of your weight ...

	  		The Calorie Counting Myth	  	




Published in

Weight Loss












Calories are a measurement of energy, so cutting back on calorie intake and exercising more and expending more energy should mean that you lose weight, right? This "calculation" is the core logic behind the “calories in, calories out” theory—that creating a calorie deficit and burning off stored calories leads to weight loss. If only it were this simple. This approach takes for granted that all calories are alike and are burned in the same way, no matter where they come from.

What is Oil of Oregano?
When most people talk about oregano, they’re usually referring to the herb used in cooking. You’ll find dried oregano in the spice aisle of your local grocery store while fresh oregano is sold in the fruit and vegetable section. You can usually find fresh oregano at your local farmer’s market, too, and some people grow fresh oregano in their gardens.
The plant oregano is a member of the mint family and has multiple anti-microbial and healing properties. It’s also an ancient remedy for narcotic poisoning and seizures. However, there are actually two kinds of oregano. The cooking herb is typically oregano marjoram. There’s another, though: true Oregano (Oregano vulgare).

	  		The Gluten Free Diet	  	




Published in

Food and Drink












The Gluten Free Diet
The best course of action to take once becoming aware that you have gluten sensitivity or Celiac Disease is to begin a gluten-free diet.  For your convenience, we have provided a list of foods to avoid (containing gluten), foods to be cautious about (mimicking gluten), and foods to enjoy (containing no gluten) below.
A gluten-free diet alone can go a long way towards making you feel better and reducing your risk of complications.  adhere strictly to a gluten-free diet for life and you could avoid ever experiencing those discomforting symptoms of Gluten Sensitivity or Celiac Disease ever again.
In fact, the best news of all for people who take control of their gluten sensitivity by gluten elimination is that, with strict adherence the damage gluten has caused could be completely healed, the small intestine can regenerate completely anew --- within 2 years for adults and 3-6 months in children.

Could You Control Your Asthma by Avoiding Food Allergens?
When we have an allergic reaction to foods that we eat, it's due to our antibodies' response to the food as a perceived threat to our body.  These allergic reactions can vary from simply annoying to potentially deadly.  Beyond what food allergens can do on their own, they can also exacerbate symptoms of other ailments, such as asthma.  Asthma is a frightening disease that causes wheezing, breathlessness, and coughing.  These symptoms are scary enough on their own, but imagine having those symptoms seemingly worsen over time.  If you or someone you know has asthma read on about Asthma and Allergy reactions and how it might be a good idea to examine your diet for food allergens.  Specifically, immunoglobulin E (IgE) food allergies that are known to make asthma symptoms worse.
However, could other food allergies involving immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactions also trigger asthma-related complications?  One study has looked at exactly that.  A study published in January 2015 in the journal Global Advances in Health and Medicine looked at two patients with Asthma and Allergies.  The patients both saw a reduction in asthma-related symptoms and a need for medicine just by eliminating the food allergens from their diet.

	  		Are You Phthalate Free?	  	




Published in

Health and Beauty Products












We typically try to avoid plastics and chemicals in any products that we buy.  For the most part this is pretty straightforward.  This year, we have decided to try to eliminate a class of chemicals called phthalates from anything we consume.  Phthalates are believed to be linked to cancer as well as endocrine system problems.  So it makes sense to avoid these compounds whenever possible.  But eliminating all phthalate-containing products from our home seems to be more of a challenge than we anticipated.

However, there are actually two kinds of oregano. The cooking herb is typically oregano marjoram. There’s another, though: true Oregano (Oregano vulgare).

Could You Control Your Asthma by Avoiding Food Allergens?
When we have an allergic reaction to foods that we eat, it's due to our antibodies' response to the food as a perceived threat to our body.  These allergic reactions can vary from simply annoying to potentially deadly.  Beyond what food allergens can do on their own, they can also exacerbate symptoms of other ailments, such as asthma.  Asthma is a frightening disease that causes wheezing, breathlessness, and coughing.  These symptoms are scary enough on their own, but imagine having those symptoms seemingly worsen over time.  If you or someone you know has asthma read on about Asthma and Allergy reactions and how it might be a good idea to examine your diet for food allergens.  Specifically, immunoglobulin E (IgE) food allergies that are known to make asthma symptoms worse.
However, could other food allergies involving immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactions also trigger asthma-related complications?  One study has looked at exactly that.  A study published in January 2015 in the journal Global Advances in Health and Medicine looked at two patients with Asthma and Allergies.  The patients both saw a reduction in asthma-related symptoms and a need for medicine just by eliminating the food allergens from their diet.

	  		Are You Phthalate Free?

Health and Beauty Products












We typically try to avoid plastics and chemicals in any products that we buy.  For the most part this is pretty straightforward.  This year, we have decided to try to eliminate a class of chemicals called phthalates from anything we consume.  Phthalates are believed to be linked to cancer as well as endocrine system problems.  So it makes sense to avoid these compounds whenever possible.  But eliminating all phthalate-containing products from our home seems to be more of a challenge than we anticipated.

	  		Do I Need To Lose Weight?	  	




Published in

Weight Loss












Let's start off by understanding a little bit about "weight" ...
Healthy Weight
There is no single, definitive "ideal" weight that is appropriate for everyone; Our bodies come in all different sizes, body types, and with different genetic predispositions.  what is an appropriate weight for you is not necessarily the appropriate weight for another person.  That is why at Essential Health Solutions we approach weight loss from a perspective that takes a person's total health and wellness into account: we look for your "healthy weight".
A tall, big-boned person with a slow metabolism, for example, will have a much higher healthy weight than a short, wiry person with a fast metabolism.  And if the first individual successfully slimmed themselves down to the weight of the second individual, they might be thinner, but they would by no means be healthier.
Because of this, comparing just your weight itself to another person's, pound for pound gives us no clear indication of where you fall in relation to your optimal healthy weight.
Instead when assessing your current weight in relation to your optimal healthy weight, there are three predominant factors that we take into account:

Percentage Body Fat
Waist-To-Hip Ratio
Body Mass Index

These tools allow for a far healthier and useful evaluation.
An honest and realistic approach to losing weight must be in line with identifying and achieving one's healthy weight, not with trying to look like a movie star.
At each progress visit you have at Essential Health Solutions, we will calculate your body fat percentage and BMI to keep track of the progress you make in your weight loss efforts.  We will also calculate your waist-to-hip ratio in order to regularly assess your risk (and the potential diagnoses) of any weight-related health concerns.
Let's take a closer look at the factors we take into account while making an assessment of your weight ...

	  		"Wild" vs "Farm Raised" Fish	  	




Published in

Food and Drink












The quantity of mercury in the ocean and in our fish has become scary and a cause of angst among many health conscious eaters, and so farm-raised fish are being more frequently chosen over those which are caught from the wild.  
We often get asked: What is the healthier choice?  Wild-Caught or Farm-Raised?
Nutritionally speaking, the FDA data reveals that there are in fact nutritional differences between farm-raised and wild-caught salmon.  In particular, wild salmon have a lower fat content (at about 20% by weight) and a higher protein content (at about 20% by weight) than compared to farm-raised salmon which come in at a whopping 30-35% fat content by weight!  Additionally, the amount of omega-6 fats are proportionally high in farm-raised salmon whereas their omega-3 is low compared to Wild-caught salmon.  When this occurs the omega-6's use up specific enzymes contributing to a pro-inflammatory state.  While we need both omega-3 and omega-6 in our diet, omega-3 is much harder to obtain from our regular diets and we usually do so by eating cold water fish such as salmon.  While on the other hand it is easy for us to get omega-6 as they are relatively abundant in our diet.

	  		Healthy Eating

Food and Drink












One of the most significant things you can do while you are planning your menu for the week is to think of "nourishment" first.  Meal planning with nourishment as the ultimate goal will help ensure that you have all the essential vitamins and minerals you need that are responsible for producing the thousands of chemical reactions inside of you each day.  You will also need to consider "energy" as this will fuel your cells for all those reactions.
When choosing foods for your menu plan, it is helpful to keep in mind that foods contain not only carbohydrates, proteins, or minerals, but rather, there is typically a mix of many different nutrients in each item.  Yet since some foods contain a higher amount of an element when compared to a different food they are said to be a "good source" of that element and gain a reputation for containing it.  For example, nuts have the reputation of being a good source of fats, yet they are also fill the slot as a good source of protein too.
When planning your meals, we recommend this general thought process:

	  		The Dangers of Fragrance	  	




Published in

Health and Beauty Products












The word "fragrance" can sound fairly innocuous, even pleasant.  But could fragrances found in common household products be harmful to you or your family?  Many people are discovering that they are sensitive to the fragrances used in their laundry detergent, shampoo, or body lotions.  Some people who find these fragrances on their skin, hair, and clothing develop allergic reactions to one or more chemicals used in these products.  Others who are especially sensitive may even be bothered by the chemical fragrances on other people in close quarters, such as in an office or on public transportation.
Chemical sensitivity(sensitivities) are beginning to be taken seriously by many organizations, even major institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  A June 2009 CDC indoor environmental quality policy encouraged its employees "to be as fragrance-free as possible" when they arrive at work: "Fragrance is not appropriate for a professional work environment, and the use of some products with fragrance may be detrimental to the health of workers with chemical sensitivities, allergies, asthma, and chronic headaches/migraines."

	  		Obesity's Connection to Cancer

Globally, about 30% of the populace is either overweight or obese, according to the National Institutes of Health this statistic is higher in the U.S. at about 35.7% of adults being obese.   Obesity is diagnosed when your Body Mass Index (BMI) is higher than 30.  Obesity has been cited as one of the major contributors of death at roughly 5% of deaths each year1.  In one recent report obesity is driving an estimated half a million cancer cases annually 2-3.  Two-thirds of obesity-related cancers including colon, rectum, ovary and endometrial cancers occur in North America and Europe.  Women have the highest risk factor and are developing obesity-driven cancers almost twice as often as their male counterparts4.  If this trend marches on the experts think that roughly 50% the world's population will be overweight or obese by the year 20305.

	  		Incorporating Protein into Your Diet	  	




Published in

Food and Drink












Protein is an essential building block of the human body, found in just about every tissue and organ. About 20% of the human body is made up of protein.  Proteins themselves are made from amino acids which act like tiny molecular workers in the body, moving nutrients to where they are needed, repairing tissue, helping out the immune system, and removing waste. Traditionally nutrition experts recommend that adults get about 8 grams of protein for per day for every 20 pounds of body weight.  But is that recommended amount the same for everyone? Because protein is so closely tied to the body’s use of energy, in general, more active people will require more protein. If you’re an athlete or someone who likes to visit the gym on a regular basis, you might need to increase the amount of protein you consume—as much as doubling the recommendation above—depending upon how frequent and how intense your physical activity is.

	  		The Calorie Counting Myth	  	




Published in

Weight Loss












Calories are a measurement of energy, so cutting back on calorie intake and exercising more and expending more energy should mean that you lose weight, right? This "calculation" is the core logic behind the “calories in, calories out” theory—that creating a calorie deficit and burning off stored calories leads to weight loss. If only it were this simple. This approach takes for granted that all calories are alike and are burned in the same way, no matter where they come from.

	  		Choosing a Multiple Vitamin	  	




Published in

Supplements












You may have heard people say that if you are eating the right foods, you shouldn’t need to take a multiple vitamin-mineral supplement. However, even a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables might not be providing you with all the minerals and vitamins that you need. Generations of farming the same land over and over again have depleted the soil of vitamins and minerals.  Soil depletion means that the fruits and vegetables of today are not as nutritious as they were just decades ago. To make up for this loss of nutrients in our food, we recommend that everyone find a good quality multiple vitamin-mineral (MVM) supplement to meet their daily nutrition requirements and keep their body healthy.

Artificial Sweeteners: Lower Calories, But Good For You?
Look at the label of just about any soft drink that has the word "diet" or "light" on it and you're likely to find an artificial sweetener in the list of ingredients.  "Sugar-free" is another tip-off that artificial sweeteners are being used.  And that is precisely the point of artificial sweeteners - they replace the high-calorie sugars used in other soft drinks with a substance that has a very low-calories count, if not zero.  While this may seem like a good thing - lower calories and less sugar, in theory, means a slimmer waistline and lower risk factors for diabetes - however many people have questioned the safety of artificial sweeteners.

Health Topics












 
If you turn on the TV to watch the evening news, you’re likely to see many different commercials for new medications, particularly drugs intended to lower cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol have been blamed for many age-related problems over the years, such as heart disease. This led to many nutritious foods such as eggs being demonized. But is cholesterol really that bad? In fact, cholesterol is an essential component used by our bodies to build healthy cells. Cholesterol is also necessary for proper fat digestion, vitamin D use, and hormone production. While normal cholesterol levels are ideal, high cholesterol levels can actually help protect your heart under certain conditions. Low cholesterol levels, however, can be dangerous.
